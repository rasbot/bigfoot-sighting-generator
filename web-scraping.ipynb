We were in the roofing business and I was sorting out some cedar shakes outside the cabin. I had my Rottweiler tied to a tree. She started growling and looking towards the forest. I looked up and saw something big and hairy step from tree to tree. They have huge cedars in there. It did not register at first what I was seeing, so I yelled for whatever was in there to leave or I would turn the dog loose. It stepped behind another tree and kept doing so repeatedly. I finally called my kids and told them to come out and keep an eye on this thing while I got my work done. (I usually have a Mossberger seni-auto matic shotgun - I did not this day). It was moving in closer and then my boyfriend pulled up and it was gone. It was then that I realized it wasn't a bear we were watching.\",\n 'ALSO NOTICED': 'In winter we found large barefoot tracks in the snow.

They followed the tracks where the prints just stopped like someone picked the dog up which this dog was too big for. Hours later it came home all bloody. It was not bleeding and did not have a mark on it where it fought something. There have been many stories around that particular hiking trail.',\n 'TIME AND CONDITIONS': 'Late afternoon.

Let me explain my situation to you: I live, and have lived, on the Molalla river for most of my life and never thought twice about walking around at night or anywhere period. About 2 months ago, I was alone in my Grandmas house using the computer, when I decided to go home (my house is only about 50 yards away). As I was stepping outside the most hideous feeling of being alone and fear thumped my heart. I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses. I raced in my house, slammed the door, locked it and sat in the living room to calm down from my strange experience.The oddest feelings flushed through me then, and now. Now, before you dismiss my story as a frightened child running from noises, I'll have to tell you of the strange past our 45 acres of land at the end of the Dickey Prairie road has had:  Around three years ago, when we had cattle and cows fenced on our property, I noticed casually how they would always stay together and go near the barns at night. Then one day we discovered two of them killed up in the woods by the drinking creek. The killings weren't average killings either. The cows didn't have a scratch on them, both had broken necks and their eyeballs sucked cleanly out. Since those experiences, I'm now scared to go hiking and travel at night. Yes, average signs of fear, but I have the weird feeling of being an 'Intruder'. Thank you for your time sincerely, Shawn Murray  p.s. I'm a believer. \n"

We were heading south and then west when we stumbled onto Kitson Springs, a deserted place when we arrived.  We basically threw our sleeping bags on the ground and went to sleep.  In no more than 10 minutes we heard loud rustling by the spring about 20 yards away, then a series of loud stomping, then a blood curdling shrieking and howling that lasted nearly 20 minutes.    If you are familiar with the Puyallup tape from 1974, this will give you an example of what we heard.  We could not see the creature.  I had to cover my ears and my two companions panicked, so I told them to play dead.  We were scared stiff anyway.  I whispered to my sister, the vet, if she thought it could be a cougar which she thought was ridiculous.  She suggested it sounded apelike.    The \"creature\" ran at tremendous speed up the hillside screaming the whole way and we heard the shrieks in the distance for at least another 10 minutes.  We somehow fell asleep and awoke in the morning not quite sure of what had been there.  I found NO tracks, but had little time to look; since my sister threatened to drive away without me if I didn\\'t get in the car.  How we fell asleep, I don\\'t know.
