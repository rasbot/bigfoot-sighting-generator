200 acres of interspersed Old growth Douglas Fir. Next to a creek 300 feet off the trail to Buck Mountain. THE AREA IS A DENSE FOREST WHICH SURROUNDS A VERY LARGE LAKE, THERE ARE NO HOMES IN THE AREA AND THE AREA IS CONSIDERED OZARK MT. COUNTRY.  THE AREA IS ALSO REFERED TO AS THE TWIN LAKES AREA AS BULL SCHOALS LAKE IS SEVERAL MILES AWAY. pine forest, you have to drive up to get to the lake, not many people know about it, and the last mile you have to hike in, so alot of people don't hike, I know about it , because I use to be in Search and Rescue, and we had a little boy drown in the lake, and we had to go up nad find him, it's a merky water, thats why it's called Milk Lake, so he was hard to find. Forest, mountains and streams Corn field between small creek and buffalo. river, highway 99 to the left, the small creek turns and runs to the right into the river. A small farm house by the road. It happened inbetween my grandma's house and my house, towards the opening of our big field, in and around where we stack firewood. A large area full of pine trees. Tucannon river basin, cummins creek drainage, broken pine and low/tall heavy brush cover the entire are. Sounds came from due east of the parking area for Spring lake, up the cummins creek drainage, which is very heavy timber and brush. At the time, the area was a heavily wooded mountain area with this little bald spot for a camping area. There was a shallow river near the camp. At the top of the mountain overlooking the edge. Big clearing, wide open. Forest trail (elk or deer trail) near a small rock berm. Know where it is, have hunted this area for two years. I live in a very hilly area.  The woods go very far back into the hills. Columbia River, mountains, fir trees near railroad mile post 36 Brushy woods along a muddy creek...important...the west side of the creek is unaccessable by car, but by parking the car along the road, one can walk south into the woods. It happened behind the old two-story house that I grew up in as a kid. The area back then was wooded fairly well and there was also a pond back there.There is alot of farmland around. Right in the middle of the road , dark so no land marks were visible. Farmer's Grain Field,surrounding area is dense swamp spruce.Many large lakes in area and desolate unexploreable country. Heavily wooded, remote, near dirt road (again my husband can provide later-he's out of the country right now) The incident occurred at timberline (approximately 10,800 feet elevation.  The terrain is extreme, very steep, rugged, and high elevation, preventing most humans from entering the basin. The timber forest is aspen, pine, and spruce. As noted previously, I was on a trail that cut through the woods at the base of a hill. The trail is approx. a quarter mile long, and ends at the local golf course. The surrounding area is a mix of trees (pine,maple, etc.) common to upstate New York. The trail itself is a common path for deer, which I had initially thought was following me. The entrance to the trail is at the end of a dead end street in a residential area, although there is no heay traffic (human, car) in the area at that time of year. There are a number of ponds within a tenth of a mile or so from the trail (on the golf course) Pine forest - houses to the west of said location, mountainous wilderness to the east to the carson valley (thirty miles of nothing) West side of Papoose lake.  There is a small area, about 100 yards wide, of trees, near the shoreline of the lake, surrounded by treeless granite. We were in my house asleep at the time.  THe surrounding area is a combination of foothills, trees, dry grass, and many hiking trails.  Quit a bit of wildlife in the foothills.. coyotes, mtn lions, and deer. blueberry field, hillside mixed hard woods and pines The sighting occurred at a developed campground, at or around mile marker 54 north and east of Weed California. It was a dense pine forest area with little, to no low ground cover. The trees, although dense were straight and consistently spaced. Our camp was approximately 50 yds. south of the restrooms, no camp between ours and the facilities. Where we were camped it was pretty open. Right behind us was a creek about 30 feet away. Across the road is a mountain that is pretty heavily wooded along with a mountain that was a good distance away on the other side of the creek. The creek was fairly wide. Some areas deep enough to swim in and others were shallow enough to walk across or just wade in. Huckleberries and some spotted wild raspberries were around the area as well. elevation about 8000-9000 ft-very steep and well timbered-small stream in canyon-fir, spruce and dogwood brush Area around this sighting is flat and swampy.  Off to the right about 500 feet is a very woodsy, swampy area. Just in the woods Semi rural environment.  There was woods behind the hotel, but I'm not sure what was back there. I know there was some houses, etc., but not sure of the extent. Forest area Road going through the country.  There were forests and bluffs right off the road. Dolly Sods wilderness. Bogs, wide open spaces.  High elevation. Spruce forests. Mountanous valley with creek nearby There are a lot of pine trees and a small stream about 1/4 mile away in which the sides are covered with tall grass, vegetation, and nuts and berries. On the side of the west hill 3/4 the way up the hill. It's a pine spruce aspen forest with large open fields in splotches. This is a rural area; primarily pine, oak and maple with a lot of low lying brush (witch hazel, blackberry and raspberry bushes)along a medium size river, lots of snowmobile trails.  The area of the actual incident includes a low, swampy area bordered by thick brush. Next the road to the north is weed and briar undergrowth.  Going deeper into the woods it clears up some with older growth forest and little under grown.  In years past sogging was done on the montains, but not for over 40 years that I am aware of.  Old logging roads are all reclaimed by woods again.  Visability in the woods is approx. 30 yeards or so, depending if in old growth area or old lumbering areas.  On low wind days, sound travels quite well through the woods. described above   This area is a thickly wooded area.  There is a stream that flows through the area and it feeds into the Conococheague Creek about two miles from where the sighting occurred.  The area is very hilly but not mountainous even though there are mountains about 10 miles west of the area near Clear Spring, MD.  One strange thing about this area is that it is where a line runs that divides the limestone ground from shale ground and it is right on our property and just a maybe 150 feet from the sighting.  The shale ground was covered with cedar trees while the limestone ground is covered by Oak and Sycamores for the most part.  The area is near Cedar Ridge Road and along that road there are lots of huge limestones that are visible in the fields and many big sinkholes.  There have been stories that these sinkholes are above caves that run from the Potomac River back under this area.  The Potomac River is close to the area and the Conococheague Creek feeds into the Potoma c at Williamsport, MD which is about 4 miles from the sighting. Swamp surrounded by pine forest.   Steep heavily wooded hill side.  Mix of hardwood and pine trees.  Hill faded down into the river. farmland/swamp/natural growth woods /and planted pines It was near a river and it was very thick wooded area with a large algie infested pond near by.

Some of the fields behind residences were fenced for horses. Steep canyon with trees and manzanita brush, fading out to desert.                         basically its a state park. for maryland , this consists of a stretch of woods with a stream or tributary dividing it and an occasional footpath. Thick vine maple and hazelnut brush, near swamp. Dense woods woods and swamp of river bottom It was where a forest opens up into a meadow, it is about 11,000 to 11,500 feet or at about timberline. Where we decided to chase the creature down, there was a big flat rock about 100 feet long and kind of stuck out of the bank. The sighting occured on a road side. The forest on both sides of the road was faily dense with pines of all sizes and some underbrush. There is a state campground on the right side of the road and on the left, at some distance, is an old residence and grounds that are maintained by the State Park System. One would not expect to find people in this area after dark.  The night was very dark and it would have been very difficult if not imposible to see anything without the lights of the vehicle. The moon was not visible at this time of night. The immediate vicinity of the sighting was dry and flat.  The closest creek area is about 400 yards to the south.

The corporate park is isolated from the rest of the community, and is cut off by the strem (North Creek), marsh land and woods surround the area.  Tough terrain to cross. 1999 encounter was on the edge of a near-wilderness area. The 2000 encounter was roughly ten miles into the very remote area in the genral area of South Creek and "Gorilla Gulch" in the Tushars. This is a roughly 10 x 10 mile roadless area.

There were mostly firs and oaks right in out camp, but we were not too far from the creek.  My best guess is the noises were coming along the creek area, which is very rocky.  There was not a lot of water in the creek, but every time we went by a certain area of the creek, the water was cloudy.  Probably not significant, but strange, as the other areas of the creek were not cloudy.

The Ranch has their own Security Force which patrols the area 24 hours aday. This area is restricted from the general public. The soil is a mixture of sand and clay. Hard packed with about an inch of loose sand on top.   It was out in the middle of the woods. Pretty thick woods, a lot of tall trees and small bushes surronded us. A few paths were winding throughout the wooded area, though.  The area is Pine forest with mixture of Oak Hammocks,and swamps. Ground is sandy with some mud mixed in.   On edge of woodline near swampy marsh area. ground was slightly moist but firm.   The location was on a sand bar in the river bottom under a bridge. ON a high ridge line and peaks just above the line of old growth timber, with in an area of shrub (wind stunted)evergreens. Wooded area. Animal was seen in a melon patch that was roughly 50-60 yards from the road where we were.   A flat rural dirt road through forested area which connects with the St. John's River Wildlife Management Area separated by US 1 from the Merrit Island Wildlife Refuge (a part of the Kennedy Space Center).  Witness owns 13 acres, mostly heavily wooded. Consists of Pine, Oak, Maple, and Palm trees with heavy undergrowth. Area is interspread with swamps. The witnesses property backs up to a hunting camp which then backs up to thousands of Management Area acres.  Outside of the Minuteman Trailer Park, Minot North Dakota.There were what are called "coolies", in this part of the country.Small valleys that dip into the prairie wilderness area. Wide open areasinterspersed with depressions of substantial size with foliage and underbrush.  Hilly, wooded area Pine woods some hard oks, above the  river. They call this spot the rocks, because the river gets real nelrow here and swift, then it opens up to this big pound looking area. The ground is like hard rock before it opens. On the other side of the river is a island mostly swamp with a lot of river oaks.  About a mile from the dam by road and maybe a half mile by boat. The river is broad and about a foot or two deep until you get to the rocks, then it closes up and get's swith and deep. Once it opens up to the pond area it get real calm and about 25 ft deep. Going down river island on left get to rocks and pound area look to the right and you will see a clift about 40 or 50 ft tall. We camp above the clift. That river can rise without notice. Can't tell you much about the island I've only fished along the banks never been on it. Once you get this far down the river your in nomans land for a long ways down the river. And there are some big gaters in there.  its in a field that farmers use for there crops wooded area with thick brush with a near by river.   This 160 covers swamp, clearcut, small field, and old forest. The "sighting" was 180yds from field, 150yds from cut, and 50yds from very mild swamp in old woods with new growth. We were on a fourwheeler path about 60yds away from the subject.   Dense forest of spruce, pine and some hardwoods.  Area is very isolated and rugged, with steep hills and cliffs to 500 feet above valleys.  This is some of the most remote land you will find in the lower 48, likly not 10 homes within 20 miles in any direction.  only roads in general area are dirt logging roads, and most are impassable due to non use.    Beautiful thick isolated northern MI woods.   Mountainous Forest, on very steep hills, numerous rock formations\cliffs. There was a small river in the valley.  The swamp is shallow water. In it are many hardwoods trees such as Oak or Dogwood for example. The rest of the area was either pasture or open areas composed of pine, and hardwood trees along a gentle slope toward the banks of Elk Creek. Naturally, all of this except for the swamp and Creek proper had been altered by people over the years. The only other things noteworthy are the docks, boathouses and Cabins along the slopes of the bank. The whole area is quite swampy, but the tracks we could see were on a two track that led around the lake.  There were cabins were like fifty or seventy-five feet away from the tracks but the camp is empty for all but a few months a year.   The tracks went into the woods and there was a deer trail nearby.   The two track was declined because of a hill.  The farther down the hill the more wet and swampy it becomes.   When I heard the scream I was in the cabin closest to the woods.  The growl came from ten to fifteen feet away from the very edge of the two track and there was thick brush between myself and the origin of the sound.    The area around the cabin is heavily forrested with evergreens (pine, fir, etc.) The land itself is rather flat with some rolling hills. The only roads off the highways are logging roads and hiking trails. There are very few people who lived in the area at the time.   fine forest, conifers, manzanita rocky and rugged, but passable trail had been washed out in many places with large boulders blocking (we knocked some of them down the embankment, so there may not be as many left) any vehicle travel the trail must be old, as it leads to a series of mines, most of which are submerged or caved in save one. The trail follows a canyon and a river (stream for most of the year I'd imagine) lots of run-off. Snow at the higher elevations we arrived at (the summit of this trail at least).  Besides the river and the trees, the ground was uneven and I came across the tracks about 100 yards from where the car was parked along the road.  Deciduos forest, with a road running through it. I think it was by an old cematary.   Mixed forest (not too thick) among small, rolling hills.There is a quarry about .5 miles east of the bridge, and Island Lake Recreation Area about 1.5 miles west.The nearest home to the bridge was about .7 miles west.  Heavy decidous forest, swampy, cedar swampr, pine forests, good vegetation, fish, berries  Big Bay area:  Extremly Isolated except for Co. Rd. 550 and some camps and dirt roads in the area.  This area has become  somewhat more populated in the last 25 years.  But overall it is still pretty desolate.  Lake Superior shoreline, many swamps, ponds, lakes, rivers in the general area.  Thick woods of varying  types, hardwoods, pine etc.  There is an abandoned RR grade that used to run between Marquette and Big Bay further inland. A few small "Towns" used to exist in this area years ago. Actually they were usually nothing more than a few houses or logging camps.  There is next to nothing left of them. The film "Anatomy of a Murder" (1950's) was partially shot on location in Big Bay.  In the movie it is called "Thunder Bay", the movie was shot here as it was based on a true story. This is rugged country lots of hills in the area. Reports of cougar being sighted have happened numerous times in this general area over the last few years.  Cougar stay away from people.  I'm not sure if the D.N.R. acknowledges them still being up here.  They usually say someone mistook a bobcat.  Needless  to say the locals know better. Munising/Marquette (M-28)  This section of road is quite similar to my description of the Big Bay area.  There have been more  camps and houses built in the area since them, but it is still quite isolated.  The majority of the building  done along the Superior shoreline for its value as waterfront property. The inland area are still quite isolated.   Large state wooded area with rural farm land near.      It was a heavily wooded area next to the cement plant and had a small pond in the back of it.

The edges of a deciduous forest adjacent to scattered homes, a small orchard.  Also a spring and many raspberry bushes, wild grape vines.  The terrain of this part of Pennsylvania has a lot of brambles, bushes, vines,  creepers, and other foilage.  Not many pines though.  About an hours hike back is a creek in a valley.  Very few other people I knew went back there. My Dad, my brother,and I that's all I new about.  These woods started on the edge of Emsworth, and Kilbuck, and went back for miles.   It was mostly wooded back then.  In one part there was a swampy area but further back in the woods.  The trees were mostly fir and cedar.  The side of the road was heavy pines and evergreens.

The creature was sighted on a mountain side, in a dense patch of forest in the Medicine Bow National Forest in Carbon County Wyoming about 10 or 15 miles from the Colorado border.  The elevation is around 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The creature was sceen about 500 or 600 yards from the Roaring Fork branch of the Little Snake River.  The screams or wail was heard about 3 or 4 miles from the visual sighting.  The screams came from somewhere in some very dark timber off the side of a small canyon or gorge. The elevation here was aproxiamatley the same as the visual sighting.  As we were driving out of the park there was alot of road construction involving the park roads. The work crews were all along the area in which I saw it high up on the side of the mountain. There was snow a large patch that it was walking beside and then it took several strides across the slope and stopped. As we were traveling in the car we couldnt stop pull off because of the road construction. I would like to know if there have been sightings of this thing in the area of the park before. The flag girl on the road site was not aware of any sightings. But am interested to find this out.Since my husband was driving he was unable to see it but my younger son saw the same sight as myself.  Swamp. A mountainous area full of thick brush and gorges. it was like a valley flatland and he was near a glacier. This area has cedar thickets with grass open areas wet weather rockie bottom streams. Dense forest on hwy 50, in the mountains, my son age 9 was very afraid because he saw a large hairy man with fur standing in the trees along side the road.  He felt he was looking at him, he was upset until we got home. Lake Colchuck is very near the tree line. There were trees though. I'm not sure if they were pine or fir. Along the south end of the lake, (where we heard the screams from), is all talis slope. Some of the rocks are 20'. The next day while walking around on those rocks we saw what appeared to be a bear den under one of the larger rocks that was proped up forming a sort of ceiling.  Alpine Lakes Wilderness At the time the clear-cut was very open with small trees up to 5 feet high or less; mainly elderberry bushes. The clear-cut was 300 to 350 yards across in all directions. Trees about 150 foot tall were on all sides around the cut area. Some slash was here and there (the usual).  Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Stuart Range Coarse beach, with sporadic driftwood accumulations.

Neighboring houses are separated by several hundred feet. The logging road cut into the side of the hill. The slope went downward from west to east at about a 40 degree slant. Trees and bushes surrounded the road on both the uphill and downhill sides.  Clearcut Rolling hills, grasslands  On the south side if the road is the Columbia river. there is a rock bank that drops off about 20 feet to the river. on the north side of the road is a shear cliff with a smaal amount of brush and some good sized Douglas fir. I'd guess, a couple miles north of Brinnon, there is a highway dept. bldg. on thew east side of the road. I pulled in by that building and past it a ways. Forested with second growth timber.  There were no particular landmarks in the area. It was a semi-hilly area with tall dense trees. We were fairly far from any roads.

The rest of the area, around and behind the trailers was wooded. Dense pine forest, near a 6' rock by a small creek; about a city block out into the woods behind the campground. It seems that all of these sightings occurred near rivers or creeks with nearby trees, rolling prairies of South Dakota, about 2100 ft. above sealevel--this is a guess. No landmarks to note, just very dense brush/trees, typical of northern Missouri. There is a small highway I'd say about a mile to the west of the site, maybe more, and a gravel road some distance (no idea how far) north.

Forest broken with beaver swamp and meadow A farm with three creeks running through it, also a nearby cave and some hilly terrain. Its about five miles from the farm to Louisiana, MO. With thick forest and little population separating the two. Black Top Rural Road with Pasture to South and hilly woods to the North. Very hilly terrain. There is a steep bluff on one side of the highway--impossible to climb up or down because it was cut to make the roadway.  The bluff does have at least one fairly large cave  within 1/2 mile of the sighting--several other caves in the area. On the other side of the highway is the Roubidoux Creek.  Just passed the sighting area, the Roubidoux Creek (a very large creek that is prone to flooding) meets the Gasconade River. On the other side of  the creek is mainly farmer's land--fields and such. About 1/4 - 1/2 mile beyond the creek is another very large bluff with several caves. On the other side of the bluff that is next to the highway is miles and miles of woods, bluffs, valleys, gravel roads, and caves. (Pulaski County is the third largest county for caves in the state of Missouri and this happens to be an area that has a vast number of caves and caverns). The Missouri Ozarks, 10 miles from Osceola, Missouri. This region is heavily wooded, with hundreds of limestone caves. There are many Lakes, Rivers, and small streams. Food sources are abundant. Hardwood & Deciduous forests throughout the region. This sighting took place 100 feet from a steep embankment with a small stream running at the bottom. Many people think of the midwest as being flat & treeless. The Ozarks are not. There are High hills & canyons, with Jungle-like forests covering everything in between. The area that we were in is called "Sunrise Beach", it was at one time, an area with cabins for people to stay in. The cabins were then non-usable, as the campground had long since been abandoned. There were still poles with inactive lines attached which stretched the length of the campground road. The majority of the area is wooded, heavy foliage.

To the east of the house was timber land, at that time if I remember right to the west was a open field and then the creek and the highway boarded that. There was a small store and a bar at the turn off to the gravel road that led to the house. On the west side of the highway. Pine forest, pastureland, not much undergrowth. There are a couple of year round springs near where the creature was, so if it needed water, there was water there, without it needing to get down to the Yakima River.  I believe the mountain this was on is called Hart Mountain.   There is a barn there, and house, which was unoccupied at the time. Nearest neighbor is about a mile down the road. There was also a summer cabin up on Hart Mt. Rd. There are now more houses up there, since the land was subdivided and sold.  If you're heading from the Severn River into Weems Creek just before the creek ends ther is a small inlet on the left. Its maybe 200 feet from the mouth of the inlet to the treeline, half of it being water and half being marsh  Within range of the gunpowder river and BelAire Road (Rt. 1).  The area was wooded with corn fields backing the woods, relatively flat to rolling hills.   The area is wooded and has little gunpowder trout stream running close by not too many houses built that close to one another.Gunpowder state park is in the area which goes from Harford co.(where incident took place) to Baltimore Co. Old railroad tracks start in Baltimore co.some 25mis. away I fished this area all the time plenty of places for it to hide I would think  At the time, the area was all farm land and forest. Since then, it has been developed. The area in question is now the "Burleigh Manor" neighborhood.   there is an undeveloped area of land that straddles most of interstate 95 between the Washington Beltway north to Rocky Gorge Dam/Resevoir in Scaggsville, Maryland   FROM WHERE IT CROSSED THE ROAD IT WAS A MOUNTAIN RIDGE A SWAMPY AREA BETWEEN WHERE IT WAS HEADED WAS A HILL GOING TO PINES THEN BEYOND THAT WAS FIELDS & woods again   All the information I have regarding landscape and such is in the description of the event   Foot prints came up a ridge across the pond we were standing on and off in too a hemlock grove. In a (pine forest) at the end of my land No houses around for 10 miles to the north of this pond.   The State of Maine's land area is covered by 95% trees, and this area is no exception. The River Road area is heavily wooded and, as implied in the name, close to a nearby watershed.  The location is sparsely populated with infrequent houses, a cemetery, blacktop roads, and wildlife preserves (for native birds, deer) nearby.   on a road with a lot of forest, near Whites apple orchard  At this point Route 95 goes through the Maine wilderness. Both sides of the road were heavilly forested. The median had trees and rocks and some bushes of various density. Shortly before the sighting I had noticed a few houses off in the distance through a clearing' so had noted that we were probably beginning to approach a more populated area as we were headed for a campground just above Bangor.  CONNIFERUS WOODLANDS   Three of the four sightings were along the Raccoon river. One was about three miles North of the river in an open area along a farm fence. Heavily forested. Desiduous trees, mountain maple, pines, oak, spruce, hemlock, and lots of underbrush (ferns, honeysuccle, rasberry, mountain laurel, rhodedendron). No apparent land marks, in deep wooded area.

It is a dense stretch of woods, dont know how big, husband said it is swampy and the Au Sable river runs through the same stretch of woods. I have never been in those woods.  Secluded coniferous and deciduous forest, looking up toward land from the lake itself. It was in a forest like most others but parts have a lot of laurel and parts are mainly all hills and some parts are swamp but there is little swamp.

Fir trees, alder trees, blackberry bushes, salal and other shrubs. close to a couple of landings where the trees are starting to grow again.  Landscape on the east side of the highway was very dense, thick, young, forest. The trees were, maybe 20 feet tall or more. The underbrush was very thick and lush as in the rain forested area. The creature came out of this area and crossed straight over the highway to the West side where he walked down an old abandoned logging road. There were tall trees and thick forest all around. The abandoned road had no trees, but was overgrown with thick, wet brush.  Approx. 20 feet from a secluded logging road on top of a hill in fairly old newer growth woods. The tracks appeared in an area that resembled a wide deer trail. Pine forest, some rock formations - was active silver mine (first to be "certified" in Boulder Cty) with still a big pit at the end of the road into the property Grassland with scattered oak trees and brush. A creek flowed through it. Site located at 7,800 elevation in pine forest. Topography includes draws with seasonal runoff. The road is in a very unpopulated area. Rolling hills, near a cornfield which adjoined a large woods within 4 to 6 miles of the yellow river bottom, which is heavily wooded and runs for miles with many wooded side valleys. I was with my girlfirend. Sound originated in pine forest, about 8,300 ft near top of a peak in the Puma Hills. High north-facing slope of the Absaroka Mountains, just south of the North Fork of the Shoshone River, half way between Cody and Yellowstone.  Pitch black. Driving on a winding forested road for the first time. Dense pine forest cover on both sides. Stream along one side of the road. Ditches and fill slopes were fairly steep and deeper than 10 feet.  I was on a ridge that looked south to the Shoshone River. There was sporadic heavy timber with fairly large rocky outcrops and open areas. I was just east (I think) of a fairly deep dry stream bed. The slope down to the stream was quite steep.  The incident took place 1 mile N.W. from the camp. The altitude is nearly 9000ft, all conifer trees, and very dense. Alot of windfall, youre walking on the ground as much as off it. The camp and the sighting area are in a basin, about 2-3 miles wide, the tops of the mountains around are rocky and for the most part bare, above tree line. There is a creek running through the center of this basin, called Owen creek.  Lake Charles Trail--6 miles in from trailhead; high alpine basin/meadow with mixed pine forest, wetlands, and small lakes, surrounded by 11,000'-12,000' peaks.   Call Iliamna Air taxi for lat & Long of Long Lake. Topography is boreal forest typical of south western Alaska  The type of terrain was land was smooth and gently rolling type of vegetation was fairly dense pine and some birch forest. As I stated earlier there was an old abandoned camp and a small pond in the area other than that there was nothing else that was outstanding I dont know IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE WOODS UP THERE IN AK near Fairbanks but at times they resemble the stunted trees near a tree line in the mountains an on occasion there are glorious stands of birch an really large pine this incident occurred in the e stunted growth range nothing much over 15 feet an somewhat scraggy looking pine. On a road called Trainor Gate road, on the more rural section of it which leads to Birch Hill. Birch Hill is where a lot of us military guys go and ski. Beyond Birch Hill is nothing but wilderness, all around Ft. Wainwright is nothing but wilderness. So on one side of the road (which this part is gravel) is Birch Hill and on the other is Chena River which has the main road of the military post on its other side. The area around the incident is very rugged, with a mixture of vegetation, hills, rocks, etc. There are lots of wildlife in the area also, there's nothing odd about seeing moose or even wolf though bear usually stay clear. High rugged mountains There were high cutaway embankments on each side of the road..ahead of us was a corner with a metal rail going downhill to the left.  Once you get to the bottom of the hill, you are around the Hotel and Raft Rental area of Denali..The landscape would be evergreen forests, with birch trees..berries, lichen, ect.  Paved walking trail / Mill Creek/ area is coverd in rose hip and black berry bushes/  Thick tree growth on one side of Mill Creek other side lines the farming fields. Pine forest and then the thing that stands out is this really big hill you must go up to get to where i saw bigfoot Deciduous type forest with all the leaves gone. The visibility was excellent. Quite rugged type land near Des Moines River. Ravines, large and small tree branches down all over. Snow on the ground. The bare tree trunks were brown or gray. North side of Sioux City, IA.  In close proximity of the downtown area. orange groves, woods, swamps The environment was prairie farmland. There was a grain field. The closest landmarks would be two farm yards. One immediately east and the other northeast of the sighting.  Pin oak flat, water standing in some areas. A lot of the area is overgrown with brush and small trees, so much that a human sould not get in some places. Nearest home, one mile south. Very large and deep flood control canal 1/2 mile southeast Bumpy gravel road with a grave, pit (gravel pit) on the left side of the highway. Brush cleared ditch on the right side of the highway. Spruce swamp, northern wetlands, beside the lake The area is noted for having large amounts of limestone deposits, cliffs, & caves. The sighting occured right near a creek going through highway #6(small bridge). The forest is coniferous in this area. : miles of unbroken swampland with small bayous and sloghs      Hardwood Hammock and occasional swampy slough conditions,...You will see the remains of an old aircraft, huge swamp buggies, maybe a hover craft (air cushion type of doughnut shaped vehicle), several old beatup trailers,...a school bus, and some old trucks,...and a 3 acre pond with at least one or two gators in it.  Probably the remains of geodesic dome cabins around the pond.      As you make your way around the pond there is a peculiar tree that's covered in large arboreal snails.  My experience took p It was in a bay off of lake Temagami. There was thick forest all around it. I saw it deep in a forest. Boreal forest in the middle of the wilderness except for the logging road. The creature was observed hanging over a bridge spanning Cane Creek.  The creature was on the opposite side of the creek from me about 200 to 300 feet away.  The area was heavily forested with the branches of the trees hanging over the bridge and the road. The road is a small sectional dirt road. We were working on an exposed section of black shale and coal.  The south bank of Cane Creek was very steep being composed of these lithologies.  The north bank (where the creature was) was far more gentle.  Both banks were heavily forested.  Cane Creek was at a low level. The general landscape was gently rolling forested hills with large, flat, treeless pastures. The latitude was about 35 degrees and 41 minutes North. The longitude was about 95 degrees and 40 minutes West.    Geography: Siting occured in heavily wooded area near creek. A volunteer fire station is direcly west about 3/4 miles.   Pine Forest   The terrain was very dense and was extremly thick with follage, with pine tree's and moutainou's terrain with rivers and streams.   Pine forest, not very dense, strewn with granite boulders and outcroppings. Unnamed creek flows into Stanislaus. The location of the sighting was on a creek bank just below fast moving water from a shoaly place in the creek. The creek had deep and extremely heavy foliage on both sides. It was just downstream in the major arm of a fork in the creek, (easterly), which is the first fork or split in the creek that occurs downstream from the bridge.   Gently rolling hills, lots of tree belts and brush. Very sandy soil .  Dirt road with trees all along the road Dense woods along the bayou with a levee running parallel to  the bayou. The area the creature ran into is very dense hardwoods of several thousand acres.   1st. Near stand of hard woods across street. Where it was standing and behind it was grassland and sparse evergreens. 2nd. Lush rain forest of the 3 sisters mountains Ninnescaw River, 1/4 mile south of the bridge. Heavy timber, high river banks. Water in the river was very low exposing sand There was an old abandoned mobile home nearby. Very rough terrain on both sides of the river. High grass and weeds..   Grasses, layered ground, dikes on the east and west side, a flat area from the dikes to the course. the course is fifty yards wide, and the lowest part of the "Big Ditch" where the water runs through. The ditch was built to handle the flood waters of the Arkansas river. At the time of the incident, there were few house within the mile. Cessna Air craft is a 1/4 of a mile from the site. There is sand pit to the east of the area of the dike I had been hunt at.   Remote fishing lake Precambrian Shield The area is a rural wooded area with farms nearby. There are nearby creeks and low lying swampy areas. The terrain consist of low rolling hills. The nearest creek with a name is Hominy Creek. The East fork of the Amite River is within a few miles.  Attala County is red clay hills with thick pine forests and swampy regions. The Yakanookany River(spelling might be off)crawls through the region and is quite wild and marshy. The Burns Rebrake has been heavily logged but it was very thick with pines at the time of the sightings with a marsh stream running through it.( Rebrake is short for reed brakes. ) The area is very hilly and was not heavily populated at the time. It's still scantly popluated when compared to less wooded areas.   We Are Tractor Trailer Drivers. We both seen the creature walking on the west side of the water on a sandy part. The water looked like it was ankle deep or so. Cars can't see over the cement rail but semi's can. I am always looking around as I go down the road, and always look in places like that.  The water runs south. We entered by Buffalo, N.Y by mistake. We did not realize the company wanted us to enter from the Detroit side. We have not had the opportunity to be there again because of this. We wanted to at least get a picture of the bridge. Rural area, heavily wooded. We had two neighbors, but the population there was thin. Our property was very near the  Pearl River.   Swampy forested area near a stream.  There was fallen tree across the stream just upstream from where we were in the water. Just 300 or 400 yds. from back of treeline behind housing.   Mixed forest area and very mountainous with several small lakes nearby. Beach area on the edge of the bushes near a forest area made up spruce trees i think it was spruce in the background, this area is approximately 4 miles from the Community behind the airport Heavily wooded area, mainly spruce and willow. The terrain itself is mixed with a marsh area where the creek is. About 14000 feet. Tracks were found near creek at the bottom a saddle.  Very few trees were present at the place of the tracks but just bellow it was thick forrest. The  rest was above timber line.   There is a creek just 500 yards from where I observed this creature. There are many scrub oaks and undeveloped land in this area. The terrain varies as the highway is level but to the south, the direction it headed has an incline with scattered scrub oaks and some open valley space.  Wooded area and farm land behind the woods that were next to the river. the footprint sightings were in the mountainous region, about 7000-8000 ft., behind Pikes Peak.A heavy snow covered most of the ground.   Rocky Foothills Fur trees all from 6 to 8 feet. Limestone area. It appears that the area was quarried at some time.   I said most everything in the first box because I didn't notice there were more boxes.  I could add though, that our property is about 6,500 ft. elevation and where we saw the Sasquatch was probably a few hundred feet higher.  There is a lot of vegetation in this area besides pine trees, and there are a number of creeks and lakes.  The area of the mountain where we saw it running was mostly bare and rocky, but it disappeared into a forest of pines.  That year when we bought this place, the area was pretty much of a wilderness, though it is more inhabited now. I've never heard of any other sightings around here, but nobody could ever convince us that we didn't see what we know we saw.   Arid, very dry and hot in high summer...rocky....deep canyons...covered at this elevation with pinon pine and juniper. West of a landmark called Thanksgiving Peak; north of the old Mantle Ranch road in the extreme eastern part of Dinosaur National Monument.   Very highly forrested area of pines.  Have extensive pictures of the campsite, and surrounding forests.  Do not have GPS reading as of yet to give Long. & Lat.   Geography: Lost Creek is a wilderness area in mid-south central Colorado. Many large rock formations and pine/birch forests make up the landscape.  The environment of the exact place along I-25 would be difficult to assess, due to the time of day: 11pm to Midnight. We could speculate that this stretch of highway would be some 6 miles east of the front range of the Rocky Mountains: Hilly fields and pastures east of the highway. Elevation, app. 5000ft.  1.) Tracks ran across our path from on ridge, across the valley and up the other ridge. We ignored the tracks and did not follow them.   2.) The summit of Emerald mountain is very steap, and in the direction that the noise came from there was not much coverage left. I could see the summit through the trees. What ever it eas would have had to hide from my sight.    We were about 12,000 feet with the creek being about 300 yards down the mountain side from were we were standing. The creature was about 200 to 300 yards above us. The mountain was mostly pine trees with open gorges, with a quite a few rock ledges..   High mountian forest just below timber line, some open areas. Around 10,000 feet elevation      Mountains, pond The terrain was typical Weld County terrain, with rolling hills, covered with prairie grasses and sage brush. There were scattered clumps of cottonwood trees and brush.   across highway 77, in Nebraska, just north of a unnamed creek with a small steel bridge near Blue Springs, Nebraska. Creature was in full view for less than five seconds, it moved with a purpose.   Mostly farmland open field around the bldg. A creek just a few blocks from the Lincoln Electric Co. Building. Houses were west and Northwest this area is between Fairfield and Cornhusker Highway to the south. The building sat in the middle of nowhere.  The animal was standing along the edge of a swamp, only 100 ft. from the road. We were in an area just above the powerline right-of-way. This area was next to a clear cut. There is a creek not far from here and a lot of old abandoned coal mines.  Dense Douglas Fir forest right up to the edge of the road on both sides, actually  the trees needed trimming as it was over the road in some areas.  No noticable landdmarks.  Elevation, Longitude and Latitude not known. Old dirt road in dense forest of Alders, Hemlock and Fur trees. Trail through Hemlock, Douglas Fir forest that winds along Denny Creek between two Mountain ridges, just below Snoqualmie Pass. It was along a logjam infested river bar on the south fork of the Snoqualmie River. We had come through a heavily forested area to a spot where a creek meets the river, a gravel bar extends some 500 yards downstream from this point, and is about 150 yards wide. The airstrip is just above this area. there is a line of young alders that parallels the river, with a sandy spot around the upstream end. The prints were coming from the direction of the forest we had just come through and heading toward the river. The forest continued on the other side. We did not cross. There were other animal tracks, mostly deer, and a possible mountain lion track.  The environment was dense woods (Pine) with hiking trails. The landscape was on a downhill slope. I remember there was a dirt mound that was about 8 feet high and seemed to stretch for about 60 yards or so. The elevation and longitude and latitude are what ever Squak Mt. is. Beside a small feeder creek (spring). 3 miles from logging road. Around an old abandoned logging road. There were lots of trees and rocks around. Hood canal shore line. Sandy, muddy, small rocks and pebbles. Bush land - River a few miles away I believe Right before the road forks into dirt roads. At the free camping ground. Its all Boise cascade timber land. Right next to a river, the river has its far bank side touching a kind of canyon wall.  the campsite is between the river and the paved road.  on the other side of the road, it starts out a little higher than the road and goes right into the forest/hills. There are horse trails there and sometimes the farmers cattle roam free there. I haven't been across the road, and I'm scared to go now.   Within a mile or two there is a Wenatchee National Forest sign. The area that the figure was heading for had no roads and was borderd by slopes in excess of 45 degrees strewn with rocks and boulders down to a ragging creek some mile down and then he would have had to climb up the other side in the same topography, and walk another 2 miles out to the nearest unimproved USFS road. Predominately pine forest on a mountain hiking path. It was damp out at the time, and cloudy. There was still snow at the higher altitudes of our climb/hike, but not at the altitude where we saw the animal. There was a body of reasonably still water further back along the trail which we passed probably 10 minutes earlier. Pine Forest along side a lake. This area is very isolated. There is only one road into this part of Alberta as a quick look at a map will show. There are a few farms in this area. The ground is fairly flat save for the river banks where this occured, but even the river banks that far north are not great about 50 to 75 feet. The forest is very dense and lots of it. The bush extends south for about 250 miles and goes north to the tundra (maybe 500 or 600 miles)--millions of acres anyway. lots of pine trees poplar and spruce trees.the ground in the area is very hard and full of rocks. The farm had tall timber of pine, spurce, and poplar trees, but we did not have any trees in the yard, or through the trail we followed the big foot in the next morning,. The big foot had waled oout of our yrad on the west side heading northwest toward the cut line, and ended up in our swamp. This is remote area, there is not another farm for 5 miles by road to the west, or 12 miles going north. I live in a rural area. My house is surrounded by fields and woods. I have a creek down behind my house. At the time of the winter incident, everything was covered in about 2-3 feet of snow. There are wooded mountains around here and I guess it's just your basic NYS countryside--wooded, hilly, mountains, etc. Lots of deer and squirrels, even the occasional black bear.   Our property is composed of fields that have grown in and woods.  A creek runs through the property and where the sighting took place the creek has worn the rock down so the creek bed is a good 4 feet below your feet.   Where I was standing was about 50 yards down from the house, which could not be seen.  Also where I was standing the land goes down a slight hill.  The area where I was standing I consider part of our lawn and it is mowed. The woods directly across the creek are pretty thick and something could disappear real quick.  Our property is in a very rural section of the county.   Across the road from us and off a little way is a large swamp.  There is also a large swamp that is at the beginning of the creek but that is a good mile away from us.   There is also a creek in the front of our property but that is really just a runoff creek.   heavy jungle abount 60 feet from the road on both  sides clearing, see above. Open flat field then dipping down to the east running up to line of timber. Also, a channel of water about nine feet wide running through field with waist high green grass.   Road bent uphill and west into timber shortly after sighting occurred. Narrow steep trail pine trees near salt creek. Near 3 overturned large trees. Sulphur Ridge is a range in the Rockies. It is a moderate climb that sees a lot of foot traffic in the summer. When we went up we saw only one other hiker. It is a lush forest. I would never stray off the trail out of fear of being lost. The summit is bare. It's high enough to see other mountain ranges. Very windy on top. Thick pine forest after a week of rain. A lot of the forest was flooded to the point of being impassable, that may have caused the animal to divert its path which brought it close to us.   Thick Pine woods. Woods through out the area. across our house there was a corn feild, and just a bunch of trees.  When you out our back door, there is a road that goes to two other houses, and behind those houses, there is a lake.  On the other side that road, there used to be a small swamp, but over the years, it dried up.  We live on a hill, and that trail I mentioned, leads to that road, and you can walk to either house.  Really not far, you can see either house clearly during fall and winter months.  During the summer, it's a little harder to see with the trees and some bushes that grow.   state forest reserve , river bottoms ,heavily  wooded.these woods cover a large area....  The area is surrounded by cedar trees. There is a large mountain range (Tushar) just  to the East. There is a smaller range (The Mineral Range) to the West. This area was near the bottom of  the valley between the two. They are pretty close together.  Sunny afternoon, good vision, medium weather day, not too hot, not cool. Old cabin, variety of trees. Semi-steep. Some small meadows, small pond. Thick Douglas Fir forest with some cedars. Creek nearby. hilley, no houses to bother you ,along the river side ,very wooded and lonely place ,not well travled on foot or ride Near a farm house on open farm land, slow rolling hills, some small groupings of trees, close to a watering hole for cattle. Fir forest, some clearcut, rhododenderons and huckle berry brush. I think there's been a lot of logging up there since this incident. Long straight paved two-lane road.  Creature came from corn field on left side and ran into heavy brush and wooded area on right side.  Mostly pine and mixed hardwoods. A creek flows through the acreage. The road my follower and I were on was a trail that loosely followed the creek. The woods was an experimental forest on the SUNY College at Cortland campus. There was a small herd of managed deer and pens of wild birds and other animals there as well.   The incident occurred approximately 15 yards west of Rt. 535 behind a small stand of trees (15 yards by 50 yards) that runs parallel to the road. South of the trees is an abandoned vegetable stand with some trees, north is an abandoned house, west is a farm field that also runs behind the vegetable stand and the house, and across the road to the east is a large, new Aetna US Healthcare facility with large parking lots and landscaped grounds. This area is approximately 20 miles north of the northern perimeter of the pine barrens and about 6 mile north of a local wildlife conservation area.   The area was in a clear cut pine forest. Mountain ridge to the east bordering Sportsmans Club. I hiked a logging road to the clear cut and I don't know where the road leads to. Stone quarry about .5 miles to the south.   At about 7500 ft, below windy pass, a rocky pine forest as far as I know, somewhat above the 45th parallel.   Pine Forest at the time of the sighting,has been cut since that sighting. Area has numerous creeks and bayous.Various Hills. Dead end gravel road.   its was wooded next to alot of pine trees or pine forest. at the time was not to populated area .   camping area,with a small swimming hole with 4 creeks leading into them. The creek banks were steep in places as high as 8 to 10 feet    Pine forest with some hardwoods, and swamp. Area led into small bayou that led into Cedar Lake and the Red River. Forest. North  of Dark Lake--pine forest, located in Superior National Forest. Dry, grassy, rocky, some pine type trees. Evergreen forest, by a dam. Many lakes, deep forest Ocala National Forest & springs. Much wildlife. The forest is very dense and has a large area along state Rd 40 that is desolate. Geography: Winding road through a pine forest. Approx. 10 meters from Mills Creek. The area we were in was cultivated aprrox ten years berofe and most of the area was second groath maily fur spruce and pine and a mixture of hardwood .There was nothing really that i would use as a landmark just a bunch of old intersecting loging roads. There was a landfill near by. A big farm with cows and by the woods. It was near a wooded area in a field. I also heard of some strange tracks of something in Portage, Prince Edward Island. Forest and streams with the highway cut through a rock outcropping leaving a steep rock wall on the west side of the highway. Dence pine forest, small medows and river nearby As stated in a swamp, at a rivers edge  Pine/hardwood forest. Not far from the Mt. Zion Baptist Church off the Spearsville Hwy (Hwy 15).   The area was a pretty dense forest that of course tapered as it came closer to the community. There was a stream where I was at and I was playing on a fallen tree that created a bridge across the stream.  Some sort of construction was being done off to the right, maybe another housing complex of some sort.   Fields and scatterd trees on the north side of the highway...Fields and large grove of Douglas Fir on south side of highway, leading to a gradual slope and foothills of the Olympic Mountains. regular woods with a stream running throug it Pine Forest  There is woods in Belevadere (subdivision behind our house) and our house had trees all over the lot. There is also two bridges fairly close to home and a creek that goes through it.  Primarily pine forest with large bushes in the area around the lake. The environment is a lake. Very swamp like in appearance. There are many Cyprus trees that cloak the edge of the lake. Lots of moss hanging from them. Frogs, snakes insects often alligators came up into our yard at night.   the foothills of the rockies  The terrain is high mountain meadow w/ lots of fresh run off creeks etc. It is swampy in spots but good wooded cover very close by. That is why we hunt here--it is REALLY secluded.  Lightly wooded area with Pine treese and a creek that runs ust inside of the tree line About a half of a mile off of some abandoned railroad tracks (which have now been converted into a bicycle path), in a swampy forest.   first encounter: abandoned railbed adjacent to new growth forest, thirty-five yards from New York Route 9N/22, one hundred yards from CP Rail Bridgeline tracks two to two hundred fifty yards from lake Champlain. Addison County, Vermont is just across the lake.. maybe a mile or so.  The area is between Elizabeth Street and a housing development. to the direct east, a Chevrolet dealership. direct west along tracks, the tracks lead into the woods and eventually to the high school.   Second Encounter: "Seventy-Five Road", area included swamp terrain. The area is adjacent to a series of mine shafts and the Moriah Shock Correctional Facility. Road leads from south east to north. On branch of road breaks off and heads toward facility. Other secondary branch breaks off and heads towards Niagara-Mohawk power lines. Also, this area is less than a mile from Bartlett Pond, Town of Moriah's drinking water supply.    It was on the south west side of Eagle Lake. Mixed hard and soft woods. About 3/4 mile from lake. Rolling hills, nothing very high.   edge of lake more bushey by us forest about 25 yards away   This is odd, since Bigfeet are usually spotted in large forests.The area where these sightings have occured is a small section of woods that runs along Mill Rd.They(the woods)used to be much larger,but recently,they have been being torn down to build houses.The area has several creek-beds,small ponds,etc.There are lots of fields.The woods are very dense,not many paths.I don't know the elevation,latitude,or longitude.    First incident: Dirt road, cleared for the expansion of a subdivision - bordered by pine woods. Second incident: In the edge of a pine woods, alongside a road.   Dry creek bed, in a bottom in a hilly part of Bosque county.  The general area was a heavily wooded bottom area in Bosque county.  The sun was low and directly ahead of us, just above the rim of the creek bank which at this particular section were around 20 feet tall.  Hills, Meadow, Roadway the area is very diversed and we are mixed farmers. The Assiniboine Valley is located about 6 miles away.  5 acre property bordering 65 acres of forest. Creek has spawning salmon  The terrain is steep and rocky as it is in a deep river canyon. Vegetation is pine, prickly pear cactus, sagebrush and along the river, small willows and brush. Along the river itself are mostly huge boulders and rocks. The elevation is about 3,800 feet. Steep, rough, wooded, rocky canyon (Wolf Creek canyon) Dry country but with a creek and an interstate highway (I-15) running through it and near the Missouri river in the Gates of the Mountains area. Elevation probably around 4000 to 4500 feet with snow on the ground at the time. After nearly 20 years, I probably can't determine the spot much closer than 2 or 3 miles.  Pineforest with a swamp and oak trees, lots of creeks.Recent logging nearby. Pine forest, flat, sandy, gravel roads, Kistachie National Forest Land open field with creek,dirt road,bridge to north I was coming into Butte meadows on the Bull Roan. As you approach the community you drop down a grade to Butte Creek. The thing I saw was about 200 yards downstream from the bridge, and on the opposite side of the creek from the campground. On a steep mountain side with pine trees, manzanita bushes, sage brush(?) and thick vegetation. Very dry and isolated off of the highway. Elevation unknown, and longitde and  lagitude unknown. First incident it was dense mixed forest of madrone, fir etc near a small creek at a low elevation, maybe 1000 feet, off Highway 199 about 10 miles south of the Oregon border.  Second incident it was mature redwood forest just off the Avenue of the Giants near Richardson Grove, CA off Hwy 101; again at a low elevation. The environment was a very thick forested area. Elevation was approx 8800 feet above sea level. At the time of the occurance, I was located about halfway down a ridge. There were no real landmarks aside from a fenceline. Yes, there are creeks in the area, woods and hills. Farmland. Pine Barrens   There is alot of forested area. and a quarry surrounding the Boro as well as many fields.    Out in the middle of noware in a densely populated evergreen forest. There is a wide variety of other trees and plant life as well as swampland and a vast abundance of fresh water. In my opinion this terrane would be ideal for any wild animal or creature.   This site is the interface between extensive forest, the Willapa Hills, essentially 50 miles to the ocean with not much habitation in between, and the farmland to the east, which has a lot of human habitation. Edge of a clear cut overlooking Packwood from the south. Medium density old growth forest. Approximatley 60 feet from the river. Area is populated with Alder, Fir, and Maple trees, with various and assorted shrubbery. In a horse pasture partly swampy with a stream near that went into the puget sound water's. The landscape was mostly pine cones, very dry, dirt, and very dark surroundings. Undeveloped forested area, accessible only by permission through private land. Forest type is predominantly pine and fir, with cedar and scrub alder found in marshy areas/streamsides. No current vehicle roads (abandoned and overgrown logging roads encountered occassionally). No signs of other hunters in area. Due to restricted access, unlikely that any other parties were in the area. Close to a stand of trees on the side of the road.  Generally: 5 miles south of Ione, 1 mile north of river. First two sets found on old 'dozer logging road, the area was surrounded by Douglas Fir forest (~50-years' growth), and on a moderately sloping hillside (~7-10%). Two miles to nearest road, 1000 yards from fresh logging site. Second set was 300 yards east in thickly wooded jack-firs (15'-25' fir trees), on level plateau on same hillside. this area is very remote, it is on U.S. forest service land and the dirt roads are gated. The sound seems to be coming form the ridge east of me and as far a creeks, there is lots of underground springs. very remote, steep terrian heavily wooded area. Few roads in the area and only 3 residence's in a 6 square mile area. Forested area with clear cut 1/2 mile up on gated road. A half mile away there are houses along the hwy and another house in the opposite direction from location (of incident) about 200 yards away. Hear lots of dogs barking off and on and lots of frogs. There was lots of standing water inside forested area. Dense coniferous forest region somewhere near the Nisqually River and in the Mount Rainier area. Dense brush behind home on several acres. Brush is on very steep downward sloping hill. The area of Cat Lake and Fiander Lake is a low lying area in a natural rain forest.The area is very swampy and wet due to the nearby Nisqually River.The water table is very near the surface.The area is sledom traveled, and only by military units on manuvers.There are adjacent roads, but they are un-improved gravel surfaces.The woods are thick, and have a thick underbrush. There is a "stench" to the area that could be similar to the reported smell of bigfoot, but is most likely due to the constant decay of the wet wood. No "smell" was apparent that night other then the decay, which is present still to this day (I have been back several times now). Blowdown area just outside a stand of old growth Fir trees. Creek running through the blowdown timber. My house sits about three miles north of the town of Gig Harbor. Between the backyard of my house and the narrows waterway is forest and a valley with dwellings dispersed about but not densely populated. Near the top of Corral Pass, parking lot, about 400 yards in directly in front of honey-bucket. Park-like setting, mountain side filled with wild Noble Christmas trees, berries of all sorts, ravines, lake, and wildlife everywhere. Road close to Minter Creek as it runs into Rocky Bay, a small inlet where the tide completely recedes, leaving mud flats. Location, to a fairly accurate degree, determined by my description of road crossing Minter creek, rural, 2nd growth forest with, at that time, individual houses every mile or so. Abundant blackberry and salal bushes. T intersection of road, near escape and evasion training area,  tree-bordered meadow. Adirondacks, pine and oak, maples trees , cemetary off Rt9  Along some railroad tracks with brush and timber on both sides with an abandoned boxcar on some other tracks. The tracks were seen in the woods about a mile from the house. I saw the bigfoot in a clearing outside the front of the house that borders the woods.   We were camping initially on an open knoll looking toward a ravine and the upward slope of a mountain. Very close to Mt. Rainier, but only at the elevation of about 6500ft. Next to a creek 300 feet off the trail to Buck Mountain.   Swampy bottom land, used to be old phosphate mine in the 1920's Forestland; once again, the witness would be able to give you better info. wooded area, meadow with trees bordering. both had rivers close by   Wooded area on the left hand side of the road, farm land to the right.  Can't recall any landmarks, was in shock afterwards, so my mind is a blank after it happened.  Don't even know how we made it home, we were shaking so much. Sixteen acre lake set in a bowl at 1200 ft., Mostly second growth fir. Also swampy areas and lots of deciduous trees.  area was wooded back then with some wetland not much also the farmer behind our property at that time had done some clearing on his property not more than 20ft from where i saw her. forrest-by river bottoms .the sighting in clarksville iowa is sandy at that time swamping well wooded area around pitts  The area is heavily wooded with many creeks and bottoms. These woods interconnect to the Sulphur River bottoms which are very deep and vast.   We had our lean-to pitched between two live oak trees in a tall grass field that sloped down to the lake's shore. There had not been any rain in the area for some time so that most of the grass had dried out, dry grass cuts down on ticks & chiggers. There was about an 8th inch of dust over the hard tack in the exposed areas. There was also a small pond about 40 yards down slope between our camp site & the lake shore. This I belive this had once been a stock tank. The open end of the lean-to was facing the lake shore so as to get the breeze from the lake. The other end (foot) faced a dirt road that was about 300 yards up grade.   A mix of hardwood and pine with an small clearing cuting in to it.There are also some thick pine forst neer by and I mean thick. Also some swampy land near by.   He was on Pine Mtn. at about 4,000 ft alt. Pine trees were predominate but on the other side of the road was a deep canyon called Browns Gulch which led down almost all the way to civilazation as you could see the city lights. Browns Gulch is a transition area with mostly Chapperal, Sage and Oak brush and maybe a few catcus almost like High Dessert terrian.  Light pine forest, rocky, mountain area, looking into a canyon at a creek. Deciduous forest, small ravine that flattened out quickly with patch of wooded area stretching through cleared pasture land. You'd have some woods then some clear spots then more woods. It was north central Arkansas -- the Ozarks -- lots of woods. I don't know anything about its elevation and longitude or latitude.   On the left side of road is a thick woods on the other side my aunts house two open lots, and some other homes . Two streets with houses then some more woods.   It was just a pasture surrounded by woods. The environment was on Highway 7 North, just past the Bismarck firestation/ambulance service.  The area is wooded, with no houses in the immediate area (however there are houses within approximately 200 yards. The area is 1 - 2  miles away from Lake DeGray.   Mixture of hardwood and pine, semi-dense.  About 1 and 1/2 miles from Caney Creek and DeRoche Creek, and about 3 miles from Lake DeGray.  Wooded hilly country around an old adobe house about 200yds. away. The landscape as discribe above was at the base of Mt. St Helen in Washington State on the North side. I was up on the side of the mountain and could see 3/4 of Spirit Lake. Some of the closer hills had been logged off and cleared down to the stumps. Stands of trees around and meadows in the distance. very dense forest  Second-growth reforestation on steep ridges with open areas limited to ancient lava and mud flows. Area is located on the southern flanks of mt. St. Helens.  As I said we were on Beacon Rock, a famous landmark, and we were looking east at some pasture land just below the rock and east a couple of hundred feet. We were on the edge of the treeline. Nearby land marks include summit of Silver Star Mt. and Pyramid Rock. 299 west is cut into the side of the mountain.  it is heavily forrested on both sides. Thick forest area with large recently clear-cut logged area. About a half mile south of Smith River. Wooded mountainous forest containing Old Growth Redwood  trees next to the Smith River. The elevation is around 250 feet. The day was sunny, no clouds were visible and very warm. It hadn't rained for at least 3 weeks. My campsite was about 60 to75 feet away from the water. Artound my campsite there was pinetrees, some other various types and semi brushy in some areas. Deep wooded area near power lines up in the hills. Mountainous, heavy forest [fir and Hemloc] evergreen trees. A creek with some swampy areas, close by the house and barn. At the time of this event, Hwy 9 passed along the first rise in the western foothills of the Cascades, north - south. It was heavily wooded, even a beaver pond on the east side of the road. Pugh is a rugged 7224-ft peak in the North Cascades. A trail to the summit begins at 1920-ft passing through dense, rainforest-like woods and climbs steadily for about 5 miles before emerging from the trees in a boulder strewn alpine cirque. By following a steep switchback up to a notch called Stujack Pass at 5720-ft, the rim of the cirque is reached which leads by way of an exposed ridge to the summit pyramid. Wooded with sloping hills and there is a creek near by. Forested area with fresh clearcuts. Piles of logs and brush were visible in the clearcuts. No manmade structures in sight along the road into location of incident. Foot of snow on road with numerous tracks of large dog or wolf, elk, and large foot prints - 18" long. In general, the area is very remote.  My grandparents' house was at the edge of an open field, in the middle of a dense forest.  The Deschutes River flowed near by.   I was in a house.  The screams came from the North, maybe 100-200 yards into the dense forest across the roadway that lead to my grandparents' house. I was in a house.  Screams came from a little further to the East and slightly up a logging road that lead from the house,  maybe 100-200 yards into the dense forest across the roadway that lead to my grandparents' house.   I was by a pond at the North end of an open field, just by the roadway. The creature was on the South side of the field, just in the treeline of a dense forest. There is a swamp to the West of this field and the Deschutes River is just a few hundred feet South of where the creature had been. My mother stated that they were picknicking in an area of forest and clearing.  It had not been logged but was natural and of course first growth virgin timber.  It was fairly dense as they were not high on the mountain but down in the foothills at the base of Mt. Adams. The elevation was probably 2,500-3,500 ft.  No snow yet as it was early fall. Location already stated above. The flora was thick north slope Tamarack and Douglas Fir. Longitude and Latitude are easily found given the location provided above.  a cliffband on top of a timbered hill at about 7000' rolling hills no trees other than what is planted by the local farmhouses Open Field, with pockets of brush, forest to the rear of the witness. fairly thick in brush, open fields and Cottonwood trees The area is typical forested terrain for the region. The landscape has logged off areas, mulitple FR roads and is home to an Elk habitat, closed off to the public. There was a logging operation going on about 15 miles distant with a full time caretaker and his wife spending 8-9 months there a year. They reported to us an event that may be related to the Sasquatch while the wife was picking huckleberries a few years back. We were at the end of a state road.  It was in a valley we saw them.  You could also see the industrial smokes from Carson WKO mill in the distance NW. Very rural at the time, tomato, beans, and strawberry fields nearby.  The edge of Everglades at the time.  Typical South Florida brush and trees - very dense and nasty to navigate. Open sand beach to scrub pine forest forty year old second growth and limited old growth residuals.  Extremely rugged up and down mixed woodlands.  below the ridge and above the stream This is a rural area with island desert mountains and an Indian Reservation to the southwest.  Also, the Salt River is to the north, and the city of Phoenix is to the east. There was a Golf course on one corner and the rest is cotton fields and citrus groves.    High Desert Forest.Creek,mountain  at  top. creek bottom, hard woods, trees only 15 ft from the house. Top of a flood plain ridge, on flat land surrounded by farm fields and wooded edges, Mud Run Creek runs east and west, parallel below the ridge. Along a wooded creek that runs into the Mud Run Creek and finally into the Mad River.  The area is flat and agricultural surrounding the site.  A ridge and Mud Run Creek parallel the ditch to the south, about 1/2-3/4 mile away. Wooded Creek Bottom on Mad River, surrounded by agricultural fields.  Enon Gravel Pits to the east. a deep gulch in the mountains with a creek running through it On the edge of a clear cut at the base of a mountainside.  The environment is one of thick pine forest interspersed with clearcuts in various stages of succession. We parked near a borrow pit. Thick forest with some open areas between tree but also some areas with under brush of laurel and mountain ivy.   On Rt 39 near a guard rail and a National Forest sign. Two small houses nearby.   This is the Tilton River Valley to the west of the city of Morton. The valley is lined with mountains, on the South Hopkins Mt. and on the North side Bergin Mt and the Rockies. The Tilton Flows to the West were is runs into Mayfield Lake near Mossyrock. The site of the incident, is marked with rural pasture land and occasional culdesac housing and spread out home steads. Steep rugged mountains line the valley with mixed evergreen trees and clearcuts, timber land in all stages of growth.  to get there , go to the old Ileandale railroad stationacross train bridge, just follow the tracks. This is a residental neighborhood across the river from the city of Morton. It is also the Tilton River Valley lined with high rugged mountains. The elevation is a little below 900 feet but the surrounding peaks raise to 3,000' and above. The Duck Ponds are a magnet for sasquatch activity the last 5 years. It occured in the Cascade Mountains, with Ponderosa pines and Douglas firs being the most abundant trees in the area.  Abandoned gravel dredging operation along the Tilton River. the Duck Ponds were created by this dredging operation. The area is brushy with alder and cottonwood trees growing all around the ponds that have outstanding bass fishing in them. there are intertwinded roads and trails throughout the 150 some acres. The Tilton River Valley is surrounded by high rugged mountains, elevation appox 900'. I must tell you about the property. Here events similar to the one that I am about to tell you about have been told of for years.     This property was owned at the time by a farming company that had owned this farm for well over 100 years and they owned several thousands of acres near the Alabama River. This property is gently rolling hills with fairly old stands of oak, hickory ,pine, and dense thickets and old hedge rows of briars and pivot in some of the bottoms. I went with a friend of mine that worked on the farm one night to look at the deer which are every where out there. We used the truck headlights to look for deer, opossums ,coons, owls, etc.. We drove to the top of a hill which was a field that was surrounded on all sides by woods.  It was in a forest neer a small creek. First sighting was on the ridge that rises at the southern end of East Boulder Lake. A well worn path decends several hundred feet down past two small washbasin lakes to the shore of East Boulder.  The rim of the canyon is barren and constructed of skree and talus.  Second sighting was at the campfire on the west side of East Boulder Lake. The basin surrounding the lake is used as grazing land for cattle with scrub oak along the western shore line of the lake and a dense grove of Ponderosa that runs along the base of the steep western rim. The broken remains of a small wooden platform sits half way between the lake and the pine grove. A rusted bed frame and cast iron stove lay nearby in the tall summer grass. Cattle wander lazily in the pasture on the east side of the lake. very thick redwood forest with a lot ferns at least in the area we were in. At this time St. Charles Canyon was just beginning to be developed by the Forest Service. The campground had been "roughed-out" at the top of several miles of a narrow dirt road leading to the nearby Minnetonka Caverns. Pine and Aspen forest covered the steeply angled sides of the narrow canyon. No one else was in the campground, or the area, for miles.  Aspen, pines, clearing, ponds.  approx 7000 ft elev. bloody bucket, elk valley, near Montpelier, Id.  No bridges. Wooded. Some wet land. Wild grapevines. The area is a reforested Wayerhouser area. There is a creek which runs along the main road. Between the creek and the above described trail, it is marshy and almost looks like a rain forest in spring. The area of the trail was mostly brush and pines, with plenty of stickerbushes. To the right of the trail is the foothills of the cascade range, and is unpopulated clear to the eastern half of the sate. Bottom of canyon, very near creekbed.  Flora included Douglas Pine, Ash, Oak, and some wild apple, sycamore.  Very wet for an Arizona environment, so very little to no cactus or arid-dwelling plants nearby, although there were the usual scrub cedar, palo verde, mesquite, and prickley pear not far away.  Along the creek side, there was some form of tuberous plant, which resembled an onion, but was taller and with a smaller bulb.  Saw no evidence of feeding or grubbing, etc.  This field is just past the Tualatin River.  This is a rural community of small farms, nurseries, and acreages situated in a valley that has apple orchards, vineyards,and other crops. There are thick growths of vegetation (pines, hardwoods, blackberry brambles) along the river's edges and in belts bordering the farms and along the hills. Some farms have chickens, goats, sheep or cows. There are quite a few deer seen around here and an occasional elk. At Jackson Bottom Slough there are wild Canada Geese, mallards, spoon billed ducks and other migratory waterfowl. This areas has pine trees and hardwoods as well. A creek is not far at all.   There's a wide array of environmental types back there - a good deal of swamp, some pineland, some fields, as well as some farmland. The area I encountered it was in a area of mixed pine with brazilian peppers on the ground. My brother encountered it at a trail near some wetlands, standing in some brush. Out side of town there are woods that range about 6 miles by 6 miles and there are houses near the woods where I have seen deer and other creatures but the howling seemed like someone was in pain or something like it was lonely. Mixed hard wood trees and pine trees with a lot of dense under groth at the time strip mining on most of it with several ponds in the strip mines, they are pretty well over grown with a lot of pines now, hills and fairly rugged terrain. Very wooded  Forest on both sides of the road. Long wooded section of the hwy. Terrain was rolling hills, and swampy bottoms, agricultural type landscape.

It is not far from the Worm Flows on Mt. St. Helens. wooded area with looging taking place, rough mountain road On one side of the road there is a canyon, but the whole neighborhood area is surrounded by mountains. The trees there are mainly pine. East Cascade foothills, scrubland. A very large swamp  About 4x7 Mi. Approximately 20 yards off a tank trail in very deep what the locals call pocosin, which is a dense swampy area bottom lands swampy It is a mountain ridge VERY near water.  Near a now-non existing miners' cabin at the top of Farmington Canyon, beside a stream. Around 1:00 pm. El. @ ABT. 9,500'.  Trees are Ponderosa Pine, Bristlecone, Blue Spruce, Red Cedar, And Juniper, and Pinyon. There are alot of very old tall Douglas Firs in these mountains. They are Rocky with alot of granite instrusives. The ground is moist and fertile.  It was on the trail to Baker Lake, which starts at the East Fork of the Bear Scout Camp. It was near a stream. It happened at the end of the first grassy meadow after you climb a hill, and pass a pond. About a mile from camp.  Pine forest, about 6,000 feet in elevation. Pine forest, at about 6,000 feet elevation. Pine forest at about 6,000 feet elevation. Pine Forest, at about 8,000 feet in elevation. river bottom land  Desert Sagebrush covered enviroment I was on a mountaintop looking down toward a creekbed running through a ravine. mostly a thick coniferous section of wood with alot of pine and oak as well as maple.  ALOT of underlying brush though that seems to hinder most travel through the woods.  the area is on a rise with the crest being wooded past the field in front of my house A snow covered mountain road. Portions of the road are washed out so the road is closed to cars but is used by hikers. There is a rocky embankment and an area of clearcut with christmas tree size firs growing.    The location is about 1/2 below the point the Table Rock trail leaves the road.  Upland Aspen/birch forest, above O'connor Creek. Thick pine forest surrounded by mountain ridges. Winding canyon road, surrounded by reprod. forest and Christmas tree farms. Road rises to the North of the Tilton River flowing below. Wooded mountains to bottom land with southern pine and secondary growth. Sighting was from two lane blacktop road. Pine Forest, ski slopes The Park has large areas of woodlands (pines, etc) plus it is close to the Arbuckle Mountains. Small woods, near wood pile, next to small stream with a little bridge.  Next to flat land with three trees, and close to Kansas Wetlands.   Very near a old closed bridge, used to be really heavily forested at that time since then there has been a lot of development going on. Different locations in mountain country-roadless area of high relief Douglas Fir forest with Manzanita and brush that is very difficult to hike through (many times I had to use fluorescent colored strips to find my way out )-a few trails from hobby placer miner's and remnants of  hydraulic mining flume ditches from the 1850's.  Rolling wooded hills, near the Baron Fork of the Illinois River. Native blackjack, oak and evergreen trees. There were trees that lead down to the river bottoms. Longitude is 51 and Latittude is 183 I believe (according to our satellite).   Rural subdivision-Dodge tx Dogwood subd.   Pine trees were dominate in the location of the animal.   Woods, mountainous, some houses. Logging road leading through timber to duck pond. High Alpine area, elevation, 10,000 feet +.  Approximately 60% treed with high altitude Spruce and Larch.  Very steep country, loggers had to use high line method, country too steep for skidders.  This part of Idaho is known as the flood woods. Western White Pine and Cedar and Red Fir are the most prevalent kinds of trees. There are tons of brush and ferns with some grass on the old logging roads. The untouched areas look like something out of a book of prehistoric vegetation. It's Awesome looking. We got into an area where we were not supposed to be going around locked BLM gates. We were far from any other hunters by at least 10 miles. To the west of us is Elk Creek and below us is Dorsawck Lake. a 56 mile long lake. Also there were many small creeks and bogs and springs.  Wooded forest.  Along ways from any town. Late at night. Aproxametly 1:30 AM.  HWY 95 South of Grangerville Idaho about 100 miles.  Oil and Gas dirt road in the foothills of the Rookies. Pine forest with an open hillside below tree line. ask Dan for more details. There were woods near my location and fields behind the woods. KOP was to my right and was a densely wooded area. It was a wooded area, with a short dirt road that led to an oil pump. There was a small pond near the end of the road. These woods stretched for miles. Rural area near lake Allatoona  Pine forest, creek bottom, somewhat sandy and muddy. Very thick underbrush-swamp-like. There were many large creeks in the area, a sewage treatment plant, and heavily forested areas to the north and east of the swamp, which was probably only a half-mile square. We also found evidence in the swamp of its previous history - upright ties 15 feet high from the ground-part of an old wall? There were three of them about ten to fifteen feet apart in a row. Further back we found an old rotting outhouse. Then further back still, we found a skinny mound of earth that went straight for several hundred feet - off of this we found some pea plants. The creek in the swamp near where we first encountered the creatures' screams seemed to have been man made. Like a small irrigation ditch. It was about three feet wide, had vertical sides and a flat bottom. All together a very strange place!  Thick pine and steep hills. creek bottms on gravel road. Meadow surrounded by VERY dense pine and spruce old growth forest almost impassible because of all the blowdown.  Area is along a ridge top with numerous springs. (Water was scarce at that time, many usual springs in the area dry).  I went there specifically because it seemed like a place where people didn't go. Spruce forest with 1/16 - 1/8 space between highway. This was between Deer Creek and The Gulch, north of the Escalante River but south of Boulder. Last privately-owned land up a mountain side, North above the Klamath River Valley. Just North of Witchepec and the Hoopa Indian Reservation. Rugged Redwood forest ... mostly logged years ago but some trees and vegetation have grown up and become pretty dense. BLM land beyond the back of the property. Prominent rock outcropping directly on Appalachian trail, with small swampy area on west side.  Scrub oak forest with mixed coniferous and other deciduous. In the mountains, of course. More like a rural setting. A row of houses with hills behind them. I remember a small creek a cross the street and before the railroad tracks. When it ran away it went in the direction behind the house.   It's along a creek bottom (Coleto Creek). Land along creek is very sandy like the beach. Lot's of trees, bushes, weeds, etc. There is a trail made by atv's. Pine forest with a heavy under canopy of oak , sweet gums and brush. at thjat time there was a huge amount of land behind where I saw the creaters that was undeveloped and most too thick to ride a horse through.   The environment consists mainly of hardwoods with intermittent corn and soybean fields.  The woods are mostly undeveloped due to deep ravines.  Small areas of the woods are a little swampy , intermittent patches of pine woods.   Along the Des Moines River near the Sumner Ave. bridge. It was kind of like a swamp at the time. First incident it was dense mixed forest of madrone, fir, etc. near a small creek at a low elevation, maybe 1000 feet, off Highway 199 about 10 miles south of the Oregon border.  Second incident it was mature redwood forest just off the Avenue of the Giants near Richardson Grove, CA off Hwy 101; again at a low elevation. Geography: Forested area. On Johnson's Road just before you come to the big prairie. The one I saw was in my yard and there are a lot of woods mostly oak and hickory trees.  A lot of creeks are all over area with no mountians but a lot of hills and some flatland too.  Pine forest with lots of undergrowth and water. I did notice that the area must not have been used a lot, as there were no signs of humans. You know -- no trails, or old fishing line, or beer cans, etc. It was in a clearing between Pittmille Road and the tree line (pine or fir). Bridge Creek widens into a swamp very near there, maybe 1 mile away. On the other side of Pittville Road there is an abandoned railroad track. There is a dirt road that turns off right there and cuts back over to Highway 44 and comes out at McCoy Flat Reservoir. It's about 6000 foot elevation.  I don't know anything about Longitude and Latitude. Hillsides of California along very curving roads through the hill/mountain area outside the Muir Woods/Mt. Tam area. rough road, landscape is new growth, rocky and steep areas that lead to old growth at bottom road runs along a ridge, each side drops of to creeks, very rough, rocky and wooded area The camping area was in the great Redwoods area in Mendocino, CA. There was a creek nearby. Since the camp was called Caritas Creek, I am assuming that was the name of the creek. There were wooden frames for the tents and one main lodge. The area was hilly and there had been prior incidents reported in the past in the same vicinity as this incident. Typical campground clearing, surrounded by forest of redwood and various indigenous fern groves and forest pine trees. The forest floor is strewn with redwood humus. Very heavy timber area with lots of green meadows and rocky cliffs and lots of small streams. Little Doe Rock area is in the Mendocino Forest just above the Covelo Dept. of Forestry fire station near the Tehama County line. Geography: All of the sightings and "soundings" happened in a general area of about three miles around the house I grew up in. It is a mountainous wooded area with lakes and streams. In the later years, vineyards were planted in this area. Densely forested area with numerous small lakes and rock outcroppings. Rolling terrain. Wilderness area with no roads or structures within several miles. Forest type is Red Fir/Lodepole Pine with Pinemat Manzanita understory.  Approximately 1/4 mile south of a maintained hiking trail.  Location is Township 30 N. Range 7 E. SE 1/4 of Section 20, MDBM. just south of Evelyn Lake. Approximately 4 miles by trail from trailhead. Nearest dirt road is one mile south. Granite Basin is what it refers to. Thick forest with lots of granite around. Gold country. Lots of mines in the area. Lots of streams, creeks in the area. Beautiful country. Lots of logging roads. Most of the mines are abandoned and old. I would guess the elevation is approx. 6,000 feet give or take 1,000. Rural area.  Mostly farmland with some wooded areas. Mountain Road but more valley like A draw or ravine with hills along each side which were covered with dead( dormant) grass one foot tall and scattered scrub oak brush on the hills/des. the floor of the ravine.Which was fairly flat and open except for a tight ring of brush around the stream.Inside the brush the area was clear around the stream except for a small tree here and there. Elevation of the stream 380' and surrounding hills 500'  This area of NE Georgia would be in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It is a very rural, remote area where houses can be miles apart. The small mountains are very densely wooded with hardwoods. There is one two-lane highway which traverses this mountain. The family's mountain has a fairly large pond and about six houses, none of which can be seen from the others because of the trees. I do not recall any specific features of the area.  Steep ravine, approx. 1/2 mile from a logging road. The area is a heavily wooded mountain area. There was a trail east of the campground that ran north to south. The Sasquatch crossed this trail then up the hill. Rock quarries, hills. But at the time it was out in the open crossing a dirt road. There is a creek that runs through that country. The crusher has many pits that are full of water and there are hills around the area. Campground surrounded by thick pine forest and boulders. Sunny day in Lytle Creek. Lots of trees. Steep, rugged mountains. The back side of Morris Dam. Wilderness. Lake's edge. Pine forest Behind my house was a cornfield.  There was a stream not far away and there were woodlands in the area.

Lawrence Brook runs through multiple towns in Middlesex County. Small area of woods which surrounds it. Very large storm drains about five feet in diameter. Very thick brush, difficult to walk through. Pine and Oak. The environment was mostly pine forest with a few hard woods. The land was being used by a paper company.  The church was built on an old country road. It is or was (been 17 years since I have been there) a wooded area. There were swamps and a lot of farm land out there. It is close to an army base called Fort Stewart.  We were on a trail, on a switchback that sort of cut across the side of the mountain. There was a small creek that ran by at the very base of the mountain, which was the direction towards which the creature ran. There was heavy undergrowth, reaching about mid-calf, and it was a fairly dense forest, in terms of the number and closeness of trees.   Remote wilderness, land I was on ( privately owned ) backs up against the George Washington National Forest in Virginia. old logging roads out there , cliffs , ravines creeks ( a few ) ancient old walnut tree's , ferns , pines , berry's , briar's , hardwood , sheer steep hills , one after another , cut deep : also old homesteads from the 1930's out there. Forest area with dense awning overtop, bubbling creek or brook at least 10-15 ft. below narrow road   Freeway. Off the Freeway very woodsy, lots of hills and trees. No other landmarks really, not real close to any towns or cities.   wooded, some vast and open meadows, with farmland and woods beyond that, all in immediate proximity to the James River.   Whatever I saw was standing in a dense part of a pine forest with shrubs covering the floor of the forest. Pine forest This particular area is heavily wooded flat land.  There are homes in the general area, but not right in this vicinity.  Rocky landscape with many pine trees. Elevation at the trail head is approx. 8400 feet. Area is not visited regularly by humans due to lack of roads. Usually just backpackers and hunters. The track was found in a slightly marshy area near a water well pump.  He was on the road about 2 miles west of Panther Creek and where the road is on the north side of the river.  It is very steep country and he was caught while crossing the road.  He stood on the road for about 10 seconds. and then jumped down into the river bottom, which is quite narrow along this road.  The country is forested and very steep.  Lots of trees pine forest, some oaks, steep in some places, a creek is nearby, and in some places very thick. Pine forest and a large, open valley mountainous The place the sighting occured was in a depression in the middle of large pine trees. The area looked as though it might have been a pond in the spring time but had dried out. The size of the depression was about 40 yards by about 120 yards wide.   deep river and on a known deer hunting area. A two way Hwy., w/ deep forrest and fields on both sides of us Coal camp in high mountains   First two sightings took place near a thick pine and timbered forest. The third took place near a corn field with a thicket across the road, it was right before the real heavy woods started. Theres a little bridge near the place where we actually saw the creature, and a cut out road through a pine thicket at the place where we heard the noise. All these sightings took place withtin a quarter mile radius It took place in a pine forest with scrub oak and juniper. The mountains had rocky cuts, and granite boulders. This encounter took place close to the Yolo Ranch Headquarters. Swampy with heavy woods and bayous. see above   Mixed Pine Thicket - just north of Texas Piney Woods area also called The Big Thicket. Wooded hillside area near some railroad tracks   Steep hillsides, with small bottom land and creeks. Large oak, maple and cedar trees, lots of underbrush.   Hardwood forest mixed with swamp/bottom land. The forest part is very hilly but quickly gives way to swamp/bottom land  I described a lot of this above, but Pleasure Ridge Park is a low-lying area, often described as a valley, with Louisville being highlands. There is a lot of farmland but now, 25 or so years later, suburbia has taken most of this over. I no longer live in the area, but the neighborhood is mostly unchanged. The flood wall is still there, but the creek has been dug out and concreted so it is now a huge, concrete gutter that runs for miles.   creek around 4 feet deep. Heavily wooded area with bluffs.  I believe it would be considered a pine forest.  It is the redwoods that go along the coastline in Northern california.

The landscape is covered in dense forest and is situated between Jasper National Park and Wells Gray park. Small ranching/farming community with a lot of undeveloped bush  Perry County is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southeast  Kentucky.  The hill we were on is on a small, two lane country road, and the sound came from a wooded area over the edge of the hill.   When I saw it, it was in a bottom of a holler and there were mountains on both sides about 90 yrds of flat ground in between and a small creek ran beside on mountain     The forest consists of mainly pines and cedars, and a mix of deciduous trees. It was not so thick that you could not see daylight, however, trying to get any bearings by looking for landmarks such as mountains would be a problem.

The lake was not in view at the time. On an old, old gravel road that ran along a small ridge.  I assume the area had been used for logging several years ago.  There was hardly any gravel left on the old road. Top of a ridge on the hump of a large pond that backed up to woods. The "Youth Camp Road" area is a heavly wooded area with houses sprinkled along the road.  Most of these homes are very nice and well built. If you are traveling west towards Youth Camp, the road becomes very hilly and curvy after entering the wooded area. In the winter time, the road becomes very harzardous to travel.  The road leads west to Youth Camp.  This camp has a really nice home at the enterence.  The campgrounds has several shelter houses for various activities.  The camp also has a small lake.  Inside the camp is an old bridge along the foot trails that fell down.  From the new bridge you can see a sign nailed to the old bridge that states "Bigfoot" tore it down (at least it did years ago when I was a kid).

To the east is dense thickets and woods If you have ever been in Indiana woods it is full of hills and valleys. with small creek beds every where. The area was a patch of woods next to some harvested bean fields the terrain is sloped up toward the south of my position and it was in that direction I made the hearing/ glimpse the leaves are off the trees and the underbrush is somewhat thick.   Woods near a forestry, a lot of sink holes and caves.   The terrain inside Wolf Cave Nature Preserve is thick dedideous forest (mostly ash and oak). Like much of southwest Indiana, the area is very hilly and filled with a many ravines, limstone rock out croppings and cliffs. The cave and surrounding area is quite heavily visited during the day. The cave itself is small and had nothing to do with the sound. The Owen State Forest borders the Park and the whole region is fairly roadless and borders the White River. When the sound was heard by our party we were walking up the side of a ravine near the back of the preserve Check near the area of Louisville, Kentucky. We are due west of Louisville, about 45 miles out towards St. Louis. Look on the map at where State Highway 37 runs North to Indianapolis.

This area overlooked the town of Johnson and the Klamath River. Top of the mountain, wooded area. All evergreen forest.  I was told the land is designated timber land.  It has been clearcut and replanted in 'tracts' so the trees are various heights.  Looking at a topo map, there are lots of creeks and lakes in the general area. sandy soil, mixed decidious and conifers. Pine forest with what seemed like a prolific fishing stream leading to Squaw Creek, which also is a good location for fishing. We camped in a large meadow in the middle of heavy forest.

There is also a creek very nearby. The environment was very wooded around the cabin and hilly due to the surrounding mountains. Hardwood corridor that runs through a housing subdivision.   The setting was in the desert--Joshua trees and brush--not much else.  We were headed to Kennedy Meadows and there was water there and I'm sure it ran close to where I saw the bigfoot.  Mountains were to the west and north with pines, etc. Tracks originated out of a swampy area, thru a hardwood forest, then across a rural road where they were lost due to plowing of the road. Also noted the tracks always steered clear of open areas,  preferring thick stands of trees.  mountains, a nearby dam , maple,pine,etc classify trees Cedar swamp surrounded by farmland and some hardwood ridges. The swamp itself is quite large covering several hundred acres, maybe more and stretching through a large area NW of Crivitz, WI. There are three streams that flow through the area - the cedar swamp following the length of their bottoms in all directions.  There are some old logging roads in the area, and one old wagon trail cutting through the swamp that used to be used many, many years ago by people living in the area to go to and from Crivitz to their homes and farms.

The camp was located on the north side about 75 feet from the lake and about a hundred yards from the road. Behind us was a large hill with dense growth of manzanita backing up to mountainous terrain. Our camp was located in a hundred-foot wide strip of pine trees that reached down to the edge of the lake. Adjoining the trees and on the opposite side, the lake met the cliff. On the other side of  the strand of trees was the access road. The small lake stretches about 200 yards from the access road and parking area to the bottom of the cliff. Typical forest type of environment. This are is about 30 miles from Mt. Shasta. Old lava bed area, fairly flat, heavily wooded area. lots of caves in the area. A natural spring 200 yards away. We were actually on Mt. Bally. It's thick with brush and various plants. There are lots of granite boulders and rocks. The location is right on the edge of the tree line and it's kind of what I would call a little step in the hill like a saddle before it goes to the top. But [it's] right on the tree line so I figure around 8,000 feet elevation or better. Atlantic Ocean beach resort area...walking toward the Wildlife preserve about one-half mile southward behind the pond is a heavily wooded area, no roads, farm country but not desolate. High Alpine Forest heavy bush pine forest his road croses a little creek just before his home Everglades swamp in a forest of small pines.

Forested area near a shallow lake. The cabin I was staying in is to the left, driving in to Pinecrest Lake. In other words, driving into the Pinecrest Lake area from the main highway, and ignoring any possible "Do Not Enter" signs, one would keep to the left, left, left, so as to end up on the leftmost road tending toward the left of the lake.  The house I was in was on the left side of that road, and the screaming came from behind the house. The house is built on a hill sloping down toward the road, and the house sits about 100 feet up the hill from the road, and behind the house the hill rises a bit more to a low ridge, and behind that [is] just forest, no additional houses. There were quite a few more houses on the road farther out; i.e., my house was not at, or near, the end of the leftmost road. I do not remember the compass directions involved.

There is a creek within about a half mile or so. The sound seemed to come from the woods away from the town. It almost seemed to be  near the softball fields at Mammoth Park, which is next to the campground.  This is an area of hilly terrain, swamps, lakes, creeks, hardwoods, pines, softwoods, clear cuts, heavy woods, thick brush.  A really big swamp is just east of the lake, I think it is called Block House Creek swamp that goes for miles. (edited) The end of Walker Road in the Redwood forests in Northern California.  At the end of the road is a gravel and sand area about a half an acre in size, bordering the Smith River.  Beyond the gravel area are scrub trees on a wide river bar that appear to go upstream for at least a mile.  Dense forest, side of hill with about a 40 degree slope Low brush, hillside.

This area is around 4500 to 5000 feet in altitude and is covered primarily with conifer forest with some very heavy underbrush in areas.  The trails through it are generally good and the terrain is somewhat rocky but passable.  A slanted chimney goes down to the bluff which runs parallel to the canyon rim.  The bluff is about 200 yards in length and has a few trees, some brush and rock out croppings.  It drops off to the canyon below.

It is a narrow canyon with a small stream in it, with lots of willows and beaver ponds.  Timbered north slopes, and sage and juniper on south slopes.  The possible prints were seen on a deer trail off of trail 21. The entrance to the deer trails were located in a small meadow like area at the base of the hill after the trail from Tillicum whent down the first major hill.   We followed the deer trails across and down to Skookum meadow (we were aided by a handheld GPS system). Heavy forest, river, railroad tracks near. Woods, and a bluff on the side of a mountain. There is a waterfall off the bluff and many caves. Forest It is a very rugged wooded area with deep gulleys that feed runoff water to the lake.  The area is surrounded with high ridges.

There were pine trees all around us with occassional open meadow fields throughout the trail.  The bigfoot was sighted when he walked across the trail between us and the lake, heading from our left to right.  It took the creature less than  a second or two to cross the trail.  The specific area was flat in general, in middle of dense forest area.  Pine and aspen forest, two game trails join together at this place, also a thick brush is along the creek. It is at least 8,000 in elevation, maybe higher. There is a silo, a barn, train tracks (which my husband thinks it came in on), and a large garden. Dense forest, mountain ridge large meadow with owens river running through it...surrounded by pines and aspen like trees....very dense forest in the adjacent area. Dense forest, small valley. I can ask for specifics. It is a very thick lodgepole pine forest area on a large mountain plateau in the Sierra Nevada range. The plateau itself is a lush area with numerous meadows and streams and a great deal of wildlife including Bear, Deer, Martins, Marmots, Mountain lions, Coyotes etc... IT WAS ON A HILL.

Dense conifer growth and older red maples everywhere. If you are familiar with the saddle area, between two moderately sized mountains, you know what kind of terrain it is.      Old remnants of logging activity can still be seen.  Mostly just the logging roads in various states of decay.  The forest is reclaiming them. The saddle area had far fewer trees, and was somewhat more exposed to sunlight.  But travel was difficult.  Hundreds of trees are still laying on the ground, and they have been consumed by ground cover and young, new trees. I would say that the logging in the area ceased about thirty years ago.   The area of the sighting was rural on a highway that goes through a reclaimed strip mine.  The are no buildings or houses within 500 yards of the location of the sighting. a creek bottom with heavy forest on one side and a cornfield on the other side surrounded by thick briars Heavy pine forest with some hardwoods interspaced with hardwood buffer zones between river bottoms and pines.

Log paths,abandon rail road ect. hilly, kentucky . woods. The chilling cries came from our wooded area, where our two creeks merged together.  This was at the bottom, where are land sloped downward.  The woods continued on past our property line on both sides.  We actually didn't have much woods, but the woods became much deeper on our neighbors property, where the creek continued to flow eastward.   Thick forest, mixed between pine and various hardwoods.  In a valley between mountain ridges.  Pine trees around camp; apple trees etc. Two steams merge in front of camp. It's last camp in the valley. It was a heavily wooded area in rolling terrain with scattered open fields or meadows.  There was a lot of dead fall in the area.  No foot paths.  Some marsh areas. Pasture field with a creek bottom running through it. Some trees and a thicket nearby. Big woods further back. Very hilly terrain, Doug fir forest, some pine and other small trees, some areas have been cleared, it was very near a 'logging road'  we followed a road from Oakland, that takes off of Hwy 99 just after the Oakland curves, and goes behind some houses. There are a bunch of roads back in the area.  We used to hike the area all the time. But this time we decided to walk all the way over to Sutherlin. it was at the swan creek area, the sighting was crossing the road, right past a bridge, in a swampy area, there are two bridges there, the first going over a small creek, the second is the swampy area, that is where it was seen, then crossed the road into the woods. Approximately 15 year old coniferous trees.  A "reprod" unit.  There were ferns and other small foliage nearby. . there are pine trees there what else I can't say, it is very close to the Schroon River and there is a bridge close by on route 8.It is between the northway and the .Schroon River Area consists or flat farmland separated by Oak and Hickory forest, many acres have been strip-mined, and creek-bottoms. Heavy leaf canopy, tall trees and many hanging vines.  There was a little bit of new growth- about two feet tall popping up in patches.  The quarry was nearby, but out of sight due to the heavy foliage and general distance.  No houses except the ones at the foot of the street bordering Dines Road. Very wooded and hilly terrain. Mountains surround both sides of the Wilson Creek Gorge area and the far side of the creek is straight up for miles up the gorge, Close to what is locally known as " The lady on the rock".

Heavy pine forest both sides of road,  swampy, coastal terrain,  flat,  extremely isolated and empty of people.  Semi rural area. The area  is woodlands, along with some swamps. Deer and various wildlife frequent these areas. The Atlantic ocean is only a few miles away. Semi rural area. The area surrounding my friend's residence is woodlands, along with some swamps. Deer and various wildlife frequent these areas. The Atlantic ocean is only a few miles away, so the elevation is not very high. very hilly and lots of creeks and streams and near Rocky River and Morrows Mountain and Forest.  Large fishing lakes near by.  Lots of underbrush and trees and farm land. Stanly County is mostly farm land and very few houses in the area. Still has some old one way wooden bridges and dirt roads in the area. very steep switchbacks on the Appalachian Trail in western North Carolina the steep rocky terrain was icy and covered in snow. There had been approximately eight inches of snow three days prior to my sighting Mt. Mitchell is the highest peak in the Eastern U.S., and temperatures are very cold in the winter. There always seems to be a strong wind blowing up there. Much of the timber has lost foliage due to acid rains. The timber is predominantly evergreens, but there are some hardwoods left. There is a lot of rhododendron. About 1/8 mile off rd.small hills and valleys and several large woods one with a creek bed in it.also noticed high voltage tension lines in the area also a clearing from a underground gas line.the best way to decribe the area is to say that it like rolling hills.   The golf course is located between two reservoirs. The canyon is guarded by trees. The creek leads to a woods and then the Ottawa river. The Ottawa river runs parallel with a railroad track   Season: Winter Weather:  Clear, sunny about 25 F with little wind.   Landscape:  Hilly woods of pine, maple, hickory trees with minimal underbrush. There are numerous streams and caves in  the area. We walking down a gravel road. Time: 1200    Along highway in open field. second growth.mixed forest was in forest land and a creek was close bye . on a old logging rd .  The area was kind of set down in a low area with somewhat of a hilly area. There was a railway line that had two tracks and it ran along a raised area that had several one-lane bridges in the area on other roads. There was a small stream that also ran next to the railway bridge and in fact there was two bridges, one for cars and one for the stream. There was An old cow pasture where we actually saw the creature but surrounded that and everything else could be considered a wooded area or forest. The elevation Is not known.   It was along a branch of the Mohican River, very murky and eeire feeling, big temperature change and quiet.   about a 40acer woods with a stream runing thur it set off the road about a mile also filds all the around this section.corn on the far side.the other crops had been removed   Our house sits in the foothills of the river. Not on top of the hill, it's just at the bottom right before it gets flat. The hills are full of trees, but the field at the bottom doesn't have trees.   Thick forest, Mountains on either side to the property with a creek running through.  The umpqua river was not far way, the beach at River Forks was about a 10 minute drive north west from the house. I was located on an old skidding trail, one side of the road was clear-cut, the other was dense swamp, cedar, pines, misc. The area is typical of East Texas, with dense forests and creekbottoms. Sam Rayburn Reservoir is within walking distance through the forest from the site. A small pond is on our land as well. The screams or hollers came from behind the dam of the pond where runoff flows through a creekbottom. The terrain is somewhat hilly in this area. There is a mixture of pine and hardwood forests on our property. Some areas surrounding this land have been partially clearcut in recent years. The area is forest (oak trees, pine trees), creek and a lake.  I think it is a wildlife park or something.  the area was is kind of isolated.lots of hills.and the allegany river is nearby. very thick old secound growth mixed fir, alder,and maple with many creeks running off the hill and large vally bottom land with pastures its a very isolated area  Flat, wooded area heavily populated with wildlife(turkey, rabbits, deer), few houses and farms.   It was a part of the country where there is a lot of oak trees and very few pine trees if any at all.  The holling came from the creek bottom. Pine forest, mountain ridge Open hill side ridge There is a lot of woods (mostly pine) around the back of the house.  Or there was at least at the time of the sighting. Douglas fir forest, a small cluster of  houses and  unpaved driveways just off U.S.Hwy. 26 the area is high desert, across a ravine sixty feet deep, with a rock outcrop on the other side, with a creek in the bottom of the ravine. there are cottonwood tres,and willows in the bottom of the ravine, with juniper, sage, and pine trees no both sides of the ravine. this open up into a flat as you move west. the siting was just south of the old American flats mill site. below the new mill, and mill pond. BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land, hilly, mountainous, rocky/sandy/desert. All BLM land which is free range lands, cattle and other animals graze sometimes as there was plenty of old cow patties around the land. A popular area for people who go mountain biking, ATVing, 4 wheeling, etc. during the daytime only. No one was around or camping even except us. Nearer the highway there a some scattered homes and ranches and a food factory, otherwise it's a hilly and mountainous area, although mostly desert vegetation.... not typical for a Bigfoot area, but still we have no other "logical" answers at this time due to what happened. Chittyville is within three miles of the Big Muddy River. (Murphysboro, Illinois, is in the next county - Jackson - to the east.) The undeveloped area around Chittyville is bottomlands swamp and wooded.  Illinois Central Railroad tracks run north-south through the area, crossing Rt. 148 just outside of Chittyville, but before Rt. 148 reachs the Big Muddy River.   I was eleven years old and don't remember exactly, but I do know the nearest town of any size was Salem; our township was actually Kell. I went to Raccoon Elementary about four miles away. Our house was surrounded on three sides by cornfields of about forty acres each; the frontage was about forty acres wide on the (2 lane ) highway, but quite remote, accessible by 1/2 mile gravel road.  Our nearest neighbor was about two miles away, through a dense wooded area. There was an old abandoned house on the highway intersection, and lots of wooded area between us. I only lived there for about a year.   Wooded area.  Area near Mooney, Little Mooney and Sugar creeks.   woods  HIGH DESERT SOME PINES ARE IN JACKS CANYON Rolling farmland with trees, and creeks. Forested except where pastures lay. Lots of ponds with fish.  Spruce bush, scrub forest, log harvested , east side of Lake Winnipegosis , west of north basin of Lake Winnipeg, Sparse population , well travelled road It is a mountainous area with pine trees and juniper bushes.There is a residential area on the west side of the road and Fort Carson Military Reservation on the east side. Crossing at mountain ledge, one side cliff, one side old growth forest. Up in valley, knee high brush here and there just about 5 minutes down from stream. This area is pretty much a low,flat area with standing water. On the road to this area, there is a pipeline that travels to a river. It has all types of trees, including hardwood, pulpwood and others that are considered worthless.  timber land brushy A marshy area, with sand ridges of Jack-Pine, Norway-Pine, and White-Pine growth on them. This in the early spring is the flood plain of the Tahquamenon River which is very close to the trail left by the Bigfoot. Mostly hardwood and some decidious forrest. Very steep draws and high ridges criscrossed by overgrown mining roads and slag pits. A majority of the land is reclaimed strip mines and is pock marked with caves.  Old pines forest,deciduous trees,small lake nearby with some swamp. Forest   Top of a ridge  1,800ft.  Pine trees as well as other types of trees associated with the Pa. mountains.  It was across the dirt road which, if you cross where we had seen it, and follow it down over the ridge, there is a old logging road that runs by a small pond and creek bottom.  There are a whole bunch of old caves and thickets back in that area, from the old coal and mushroom mines. There is a really long (probably 3 to 4 mile) valley that loops around the hill and leads into a huge stand of pines.   Old strip mine which had been re-planted with pine trees. There is a large lake about a mile or so "cross country" away from where I saw it.   This is a wooded area of summer cottages and one mobile home. It is back about a 1/2 mile from the main road, down a dirt raod. It is really only a summer place for vacationing. Not many use it in the winter. There is a creek, Conniquinessing Creek. The creek is fairly large. There is a farmer's fields across the creek.   Sloping terrain approx. 400 yards from river. There were big pine trees and mountain laurel and giant rocks. It happened near Clarion.   Near top of mountain on Rt. 410, very wooded.   The area of the incident is as diverse as it is vast. A common term for this part of PA is the North Central Teir. The mountains are 2 to 4 times larger and much steeper than the ones of my native Lebanon County.   I found that the only way to climb these mountains without half killing yourself is up the hollows.  The terain is very diverse ranging from Laurel 15 feet high and extremely dense, to pine stands on entire hillsides with 10' visibility, to mature open growth with visibility of hundreds of yards.   The food availability is sparse at best. The lack of clear cuts to support browse and extreme hunting pressure in the 60's and 70's has all but turned the area of the incident into a " mountain desert."   There is a fair abundance of water in the creeks, sporadic crops of beechnuts, acorns and rare fruit producing shrubs.   The hill along my cabin is the more open terain, the hollow is a small stand of pines and the origination point of the noise is from a heavily grown Combo of Laurel and Hardwoods with huge rocks around. There are also many blowbowns that I notice seem to attract feeding deer.   The area is about 200 feet from the nearest road.  There is a large manmade pond on one side that has a natural spring running right beside it.   Behind the pond is a decent sized, heavily forested mountain with many small caves if you know where to find them.  On another side is a large open field, with the apple orchard behind that.   There were also about 5 small sheds in the clearing.   Dirt road with thick (possible state) forest on either side.   the trail runs along a ridge, with a swamp, which becomes a pond further down the trail, on the north side and more swamp (not as thick) on the south side. Fairly thick trees run the sides of the ridges. I now the near( within a few feet) spot of the sighting.   There are railroad tracks near the ovens and many are overgrown and its possible to enter them without evidence of doing so if you are careful.   There are also reports of bums using these abandoned ovens but that does not account for the small animal skeletons that are sometimes found and the "beds" made out of brush that are sometimes in them.   At times also a smell like sulphur or rot can be detected.   The incident occurred in a deciduous forest on a slight hill about 50 yards away from a small creek in a some thick brush.   On 83 acres of woodland. The land below the "inhabited" area drops off into a creekbed.  No one goes on the land at all, and has been neglected for many years.   Lake surrounded by Steep Mountain and ridge. Very dense brush   This happened in a narrow strip of woods which was about 80 yards wide and ran along the Mongahela River, in Greensboro, PA.   The environment is densely wooded area with many hills and valleys. There was a creek near by and also so railroad tracks.  I am not sure of the Long. & Lat., but it was just east of the town of Jefferson in Greene County, PA.   Along a creek coming down the mountain.  In an area thick with mountain laurel and pine trees   mountains of pa. base of the mts. have fields that slop down to creek bottoms other data i can get, as i have topo maps of the area   Small mountain in the Laurel Highlands, dense woods and no regular human habitation. overgrown pasture fields, extremely rugged mountainous terrain surrounded by hardwood forest  They went for the brush to hide.  During our discussion, we thought the creature might have been attracted to our camp for food or just to observe us. Dense second-growth classic Pacific Northwest rain forest. See above Mountainous, with open grasses with dark pine timber and aspen. Near Skagway Reservior, 10 miles south of Pikes Peak. The tree marking was on a dirt road that runs through a valley of a old strip mine surounded by woods on either side.  The animal remains were found in a middle of a field about a hundred yards wide and about two miles long. Woods & stream. Open ranch land, but bordered by river bottom with very heavy foliage.  Lots of willows, and alders.  Doris Lake in the John Muir Wilderness  Heavily wooded area near a very large lake.  Fairly thick forest. Pine trees, etc., but not really far from civilization. Maybe ten minutes from Auburn, which is a good sized town. Hwy 49 has lots of traffic now, but it was still a pretty busy road even then. Second or third growth fir and cedar forest, 200 yards or so from a bluff above a saltwater inlet known as the Strat of Juan De Fuca.  The vacinity is wooded with a bit of shallow wetlands and a few small lakes are nearby.  We are up on top of a rolling plateau of land that rises up from sea level on one side, cliff on another, and forest on the other two sides.  If you look at a closeup map of P.T, which looks like a dragon's head, it would be located at the eye (Tibbal's Lake).  There are only 7 or 8 residences over the span of 10 or so acres.  No street lights are nearby. It's a wood made up of all different types of trees.  There is a small pond a short distance to the west of the location where the creek feeds into.  It is very hilly in that area of the town.

The creature stood on a rock beside the road staring straight at us. Wooded area in a developing sub-division.  I had a clear shot from my position to where I saw the creature.  The woods were dense enough to wander through and never see the houses that had been built.  The area has changed greatly today, but you could still loose your orientation and get displaced for a while. woods, oaks, manzanita, poisen oak, etc. rolling hills, low grass and rocky.

Adjacent to large flat area at end of FS road 10N06. Area is heavly planted with pine trees with some grassy clear cut fields in between.However these animals were in transit from the wilder area a few miles further east. Mosquitoes had just recently diminished from some early frosts and that always makes the critters not just bigfoot more active. Evergreen forest and lake edges I just heard noises in the large pine forest. I don't think that there was a creek or river nearby but Lake Tahoe is nearby. Mixed pine and deciduous forest in surrounding area. We camped in a glen surrounded by pine trees near a couple of trailheads; a small stream nearby. Pennsylvania Timber Land These incidents occurred within the boundaries of the homelands of the Mescalero Apaches in NM.  Mescalero is a small community located in south central NM on Hwy 70, about equidistant from Ruidoso to the east and Tularosa to the west.  The nearest big cities are El Paso, TX, and Albuquerque, NM.  Mescalero community sits in a valley surrounded by mountainous terrain, heavily wooded with oak, walnut, and various conifers.  A stream runs through Mescalero, crosses under the highway and runs along what is called "The Old Highway."  It is at two sites along the old highway that two sightings have recently occurred.  Homes are located along this road, with some just back from the highway.  The sightings occurred at (name withheld) place about a mile or so from Hwy 70.

Township road with cornfields on both sides The creature came down from behind my house and passed between my house and my nextdoor neighbors.  It then crossed [the road] and went out of sight.  There is a low fence across the road, and then a small creek but my brother did not see it after it crossed the road.  There are many mountains around this area, including Poor Mt.   Just off a 4 lane roadway.  At the time, no residences or businesses were within about a mile, except to the north.  The area to the east of the roadway was a creek/drainage ditch, becoming wooded area the a short distance from the roadway.  To the west, a field, and wooded area beyond.  A  shopping center to the north, about half a mile.   The area where the creature was actually standing was a creek bottom (rarely filled with much water).

We lived in a valley surrounded by hills, at the time very few people lived there & the countyside had a lot of brushes & trees to hide behind.  In the woods behind my home.  Mostly piney forest and swampy bottom land. They would very, very far back into the woods.

The area was a mixture of meadow, marsh, and a pine forest with a mountain ridge. ALOT OF TREES SAND THE KIND OF STUFF DOWN BY A RIVER,IT'S ALSO WHERE THE OLD SAND PLANT USED TO BE. The river has been cut into the ground over time. It's sides are about 30 feet higher than the water with a slight incline. The gravel bed goes from one bank to the other and from river to river it is about 50 feet. The environment was heavy pines and underbrush and swamp there was a deep creek running east and west about 500 yards to the north of the property.we were about three miles from the San Jacinto river.The land around the area was pines,swamps,and here and there subdvisions that were most new and undeveloped.

A few ravines were noted close to the area.   The closest landmarks to the north is the,"Welcome to Geneva, Ohio"  sign and a small trailer park. To the south, there is a set of  railroad tracks about a 1/2 mile away from the sighting location.  As of today, the area is starting to be developed with scattered homes.   It was one of those real thick pine forests, but not real big just one of those patchy areas that turn up in the middle of Oaks, Maples, and Birch. Alot of northeastern Ohio is like that and just gets more like that when you get into the hardwood pines of the mountains of Pennsylvania.

Its exposure to the open was limited. top of forest adjoining Beaver Creek State park  -  Old growth woods -- Oaks, Maple, Elm small feeder streams and a few caves   The landscape was a flat, rear yard at my parent's home. All mowed grass. Not sure of the long. or lat., I can obtain that for you if you would like. The elevation is somewhere around 1200'.   In a wooded area. The creature apparently was walking along and had to cross a creek. It happened to step on a sand bar, which was no more than 2 feet by 3 feet. It left another partial print and then stepped back onto solid ground.   River bottom alder, swamppy, at the base of Mt Higgins Typical eastern woodlands, no pines nearby, just saplings near the roadside, and a forest of younger maples, birch, cottonwoods, etc. one road in and out pine trees and brush on both sides of the road and I think there were swamps around kind of isolated  Thicket,Riverbottom,and Pasture.

The clearing where we camped was grassy.  The woods where the animals came out of was deciduous cottonwood, alder and maple.  Very much overgrown with blackberry bushes. We live up on a ridge, that at one time was logged so we have a big driveway so to speak that is nothing but mud and sandstone. Wayne National Forest borders the back of our 80 acres. there is a swamp to the south a grassy field to the north & woods to the east & another field followed by more woods to the west, and a small stream to the south.

Madrones, douglas fir and maybe a redwood or two.  The terrain is hilly, and mountainous at points.  There was a creek nearby.  We selected the spot to camp because of it's unused and remote look. brush, rocks, creek bottom Typical Pacific Northwest woods-lots of trees, sprarser near the stream. There wa a ridge behind us-we came down it to reach the stream, and followed the stream back to our base camp. Creek bottom surrounded by brush near two man made reservoirs.  There is a large plain the extends for app. 200 yards. There is then  a narrow tree line(25 yeards)and after that you cross into my neighborhood. Once in my neighbor hood you come to a small lake surrouned on all sides by trees except for the east side. This opens up into the park. The park is maybe 200 yards long then the woods begins again. I could see the creature monving away from the lake and running back to the woods. Heading toward Estacada the Clackamas river is on the right. The swamp or marshy area on the left diagonally if I remember correctly and cliff or bluff behind swamp. Wooded area(hard woods). There is a gas line that runs through the area.

Dense Pine forest with oak and ceder outcrops and in a meadow with grass and a stream. Thickly forested. I was told that it took the witnesses two hours to walk from where they parked their truck to the site. At the time the area was thinly settled farming communities, with fields and uncleared land.  Today it is mostly part of Natchez Trace State Wild Life area.   Moderate forest w/ combination hardwood and pinetrees. The lane I was on was once used to lead to an old house back there that had been abandoned a few years before.  Very heavily wooded forest and rolling hills. A creek runs through the valley floor.   The being was standing in a ditch that ran though a 8-10 acre woods. the woods are about 50 feet off the road. on the other side of the road is open farmland. there are houses a1/4 mile on either side of the ditch. the farm to the north has a barn within 100 feet of the ditch.   Its a long road with lots of trees on both sides. On one side of  the road has a large quarry. A place where we use to go 4wheeling its right off Alum Creek Drive.

The camp sit was in a pine forest.  The stacked rocks were on a giant rock formation.  There was a mountain ridge off in the distance beyond the stream.  We never made it to the stream but we could hear it. WOODED FARM AREA WITH CREEKS, PONDS, AND BRIDGES End of Rock Creek Road was a loggin landing where the logs were loaded onto trucks. The predominant trees were D. fir and Hemlock. farm land- corn fields, wheat fields, alot of woods, many ponds and lakes, creeks Wetlands and woods.) PINE/HARDWOOD FOREST, THERE WAS A CREEK WITH A ONE LANE BRIDGE. This is on the top of a very high hill. Very wooded and rural with state forest close by there is a lake across the top of the hill if it matters..we have a horse, numerous cats and kittens and 2 dogs It was on a ridge with trees scattered around. At that time it was very heavily wooded. There is a good amount of swamp  back in the center of the woods. The area is still pretty wooded but there are more homes around the area. The block is about 2 by 3 miles square. deep bush, hilly country. many swamps,and dry grass swamps. thick cover , ever greens many birches and poplars. Thick forest, remoteness, and a creek with a good size water fall. Alternating tree stands and fields     The first area described where the sightings by my wife is where the road nears Stoney Creek, with woods and open fields close by. The area around my home location is near the creek with open fields and woods nearby. Both locations are close to National Forests on both sides. This is not a really heavily populated area. The opposite side of I-5 has a swamp. Animal crossed a road. Second growth alder and fir. Relatively open where it crossed. Several gametrails at this exact location. Pine and Douglas Fir forested and about 200 feet east of Payette Lake. Mixed pine plantings, deciduous forest, swamps and cattle pasture.  Very hilly and crisscrossed with creeks and small streams. Uunder the bridge, at the bank of the Scioto River.  It was near a small pond and open area on one side of the road.  The first was under pine trees. The second is close to some marshy land and woods that are pretty extensive. We also live by a small animal preserve Small slow water section of creek in heavy deciduous forest in mountainous terrain. Mixed wooded areas and thick brush (berry thickets, tall grasses etc) near an old logging road south of leaf river management area pine forest swamp At border of forrest and private land.  Pine and hardwood (birch) forests with swamps and lakes.  No real structures anywhere around there.   Eastern edge of the Blast Zone. Smaller pine trees 10 - 15 ft  Bear Meadow The sound was coming from the forest to the north of the Ranch, the area we would take the campers to hike, where there was nothing man made for about a few miles North and West of the Ranch area.  In the immediate area I recall there being an old trail and delapidated bridge over a canal some say was constructed under the direction of George Washington.  The area was thickly wooded and to the East a 1/4 of a mile was the Ranch bunk house, ropes course, and stables.  South about a 1/4 of a mile of the area were the boy's cabins, the lodge, the nurses cabin, and the girl's cabins. Near large river, small stream ,dense thickets and swampland, also high valley rim  all within 3/4 mile radius In the mountains, off of a dirt logging road.  The second time was deep down by a creek, way off of a dirt road. pine forest alot of pines dense woods with a few creeks an marshes some open fields Pine Woods, Mountain sight Dense woods, a few ridges, ponds, and a few houses with farms.  pine forest near Catawaba River The environment is dense old-growth redwoods and fern forest. It was muddy but dried up; lots of twigs and willow trees; the path turned a bunch of different ways and there are lots of little streams. Forrest, river extremly brushy around clear cut, stickers and lots of vine maple, clear cut devoid of vegitation creek bottom/sparsely populated Redwood forest and other trees. Some shrubs. Ridge top. Fire and wilderness access road as described. Very remote and 7 miles off the wilderness crest highway. Note that there was a recent fire in the lower sierras that interupted a vast area of the local habitat. Rocky, tundra no trees. Farm fields mixed with bush, on the edge of 500 miles of solid bush to the north. Steep hillside near bottom of valley, about 2500 feet, between mountain ranges with peaks over 9000 feet. Rock outcrops and hard ground, with pine, tamarack and willow.  Back yard, about 20 feet behind the house. The yard is three levels, the top containing an overgrown fenced in pasture, and locust trees, the middle part (where this occured) is a long narrow strip with two small flower gardens and a small one room cabin in the back. The lower yard is grass leading to a large overgrown field that separates the house from the neighbors. At the back end of the yard is a grove of pine, locust and apple trees at the edge of a field. About 100 yards farther out is a hill leading down to a small creek the flows along the bottom of a mountain. Mountainous, mixed conifers. Elevation about 10450 feet. The day was extremely cold and windy. Forest, big pines, a creek, one bathroom structure near by, fairly high elevation. High Sierra conifer forest, near the treeline. Fleming Lake is at about 9600 feet. Lots of forest interspersed with cold lakes and meadows. Snowfields present on the shady side of many of the peaks. Very rugged and remote, though back then the area got a fair amount of backpack and pack horse traffic. We saw lots of bear and deer prints in the area. It was in a clear cut down by the lake long narrow lake,west side leads out into flat farmland the east side has a high ridge dropping down to the shore. part of chippawa forest Pine trees, granite rocks, manzanita bushes.  Powerline dirt road running along either telephone or electric lines strung between wooden poles It was a fairly low gradient (not too steep) talus slope in a mountainous subalpine fir forest between the Clark Range and the Merced Gorge. Typical  Ohio woodlands. My land is a saddle between two hills. It is surrounded by hills on 4 sides. An old mine road runs the length of my property and I have built a cabin next to the road. My friends have a Winnebago and a small trailer on the land.   These incidents occurred in a forested area behind our house. We live on a ridge and there is a creek at the bottom of the hill and a hill going up to another ridge on the other side of the creek. The area is heavily forested but has been logged recently.  It is not a particularly remote area though the woods probably go for a few miles without any houses.   The creatures walked down the hill approaching a pond. Strip  mining formed the area. Mining not glaciers formed the ponds in southern Ohio.   21 acres in a hollow, surrounded by rolling hills and woods. A creek flows west to east on the southern part of the area with a county road running parallel.  This was a cut through path between about 10,000 pinetrees. (about a 20 foot wide path. There was a wooded area behind me with a creek running through it.   In a marina, approx. one mile south of the dam, along the western shore of Lake Milton Reservoir, Mahoning County, Ohio.   It both wooded and swampy in the area. There is a nearby branch of the Rocky River and an over train trestle in the area. The area is full of white-tail deer and other indigenous wildlife. There is a freeway overpass near the area. It is about 25 miles west of Akron, and 35 miles south of Cleveland.   The Place this occurred is just inside the city limits of Woodsfield, Ohio. The town is very small, but the sighting did occur with in a few hundred feet of houses. It had been and was snowing very heavily that night. The creatures tracks came down off of a very steep embankment and then continued across SR 78. We later found out that on the bank there is a natural spring that flows year round. South Eastern Ohio is a very hilly place. Very much like the whole of West Virginia.   Wooded area.   Around the Aurora Lake area.  The terrain is made of mostly hard wood trees.  In the 70's, there were many swamps and creeks flowing through the area.  Today, the area is still there.  Unfortunately, housing developments will be taking over within the year From what it sounded like, it came from the woods behind the apartment complex, either on or near the railroad tracks. Trust me, this was not a train  Rural farmland mixed with forests and swamplands. Tracked along edge of soybean field and large stand of white birch. One of the highest elevations in county.  Geography: Farmers fields were behind the creature. It seemed to be heading towards Mogadore Reservoir. Area has many farms and is heavily wooded elsewhere.   The specific incident was adjacent to Twin creek, about 3/4  mile downstream from an abandoned gravel pit, in a bottoms area...lots of heavy willow, cedar, and locust patches, about 1/2 mile from the nearest house. The area floods over every couple of years, so no other homes are there and the one house has since been leveled. There is a large cornfield approx. 300+ yards from where I was fishing, at the base of a dirt cliff. The overall area is classic Ohio, lots of big fields lots of patches large and small of thick woods, lots of creeks   Heavily forested hills. Very typical of the Mohican State Forest area. I (researcher)drove down thru the area and must say it reminded me of Tuscarawas and Guernsey County's in terrain type.   We were next to a small forest, but there are larger forests in the immediate area. The terrain is rather hilly and it is not too far from a place called Clearfork Reservoir.   It is the Shawnee Forest with all species of trees, but mainly pine. It was on a hill at the bottom was a small creek that flows into the camps lake. There are cabins in the area one on each ridge. There was also a trail that lead back into the forest to the Lou Wetzel cabin.   As for longitude & latitude I would have to find a map, but I could take you there today and show you the general area.    Cut Rock is the area where all my encounters took place.    If you could look at a topographical map these ridges are or would be all connected if it weren't for roads and highways (St. rt 125). I don't know if this is the same creature but it could travel from Peach Orchard to Picnic Point in a matter of a few days.   I found a connection, possibly, between the area's of my parents house, Camp Oyo and the Verne Riffe Three C camp area. Not only is here the ridges but I found an old map of the forest last night at my parents house that showed hiking trails and unused logging roads. There is a logging road that goes from the top of cut rock, above my parents house but according to the map it connects with one of the main hiking trails that lead right to Camp )yo and then on to the Three C camp and the Picnic Point area.     Deciduous forest and farm land   Train tracks that had been removed at the entrance of a collapsed train tunnel. Steeply rising wooded banks on either side of the former tracks. The nearest house is about 6 miles away. The area is about 9 miles away from RT.800 between Sandyville and Mineral City Ohio.   A farm field surrounded on 3 sides by dense wooded areas, with a small creek and an abandonded farm house approx. .4 mi. from the woods.   Southeastern Ohio. Hilly. Thick woods. Some patchy clear areas. Quiet. Non populated (except deer season). Very Serene area   My friend's parents Mobile home is out on a old gravel road The nearest house was about 1/4 mile away. The mobile home sat upon a hill with the entry through the back door. Behind the house was a 3 strand barbed wire fence with a cow pasture next to the woods which stretched for miles.   heavy timber doug fir   It was on my rural, heavily forested property, which I use only for camping.  State forest and one or two cow farms surround it, not many people. Pine forest, brush Creek bottom wooded beside an open field. This is typical eastern Ohio woodland. I own a saddle between two mountains and surround on four side by mountains. Across the road is an old strip mine area that was mined near the beginning on the 1900s and hasn't been reclaimed. A deep mine road runs the length of my place, this mine was dynamited in 1880s. There is a lot of wilderness to the south, north, west, and east. This is the start of Appalachian Ohio and gets very rugged towards the Ohio River to the East. Heavily wooded...dirt road...some creeks...some swamp...oil wells. The area is fairly dense forest.  We live pretty much in Bear Mountain state park.  So there is a combination of coniferus and decidous trees.  The area where the footprints led to was our chicken coup.  I can't remember if at the time there were chickens in it or not.  Where the footprints started there was a cherry, apple, and chesnut tree.  About 30 yards to the right of the chicken coup there was a shed that we had built little cages for our rabbits.  In between the chicken coup and shed/rabbit cages was a thick area of rasberry, and black berry bushes.  And to the immediate front right side of the shed/rabbit cages was a young pear tree.   We live on the Eddy Creek near forestry roads and about quarter of a mile from the mountain cliffs where there are caves Meadow with low grass,spruce trees dotting the landscape,ravine with creek on left Heavy forest terrain, right next to Cheney Road pine forest, dense underbrush, lots of fog Described with story. The east side of the road was covered with hard-wood forest - oaks and hickories.  Minor brush is typical of that area also.  The terrain is rolling, with approximately 200' of relief between the highest hills and the lowest creek bottoms.  The west side of the road was more brushy - like a farmer had cleared it many years ago, but not kept up with it.  There was also some pasture further north of the site.  The creek bottom was in the middle of hardwood forest. Trough the middle of a bean field heading straight towards our house. Lightly forested area with some fields on a state gameland that surrounded a large swamp.  Wooded with some open pasture land for cattle and it was normal terrain for the ozarks just rolling hills and creek bottoms.

Pine and balsam trees along with maple and birch grow right to the waters edge in most places except where boulders and rocky outcrops break the shore line.  Heavily forested. The cabin was perched on a hillside, with a creek running at the bottom of the hill and a house on the other side of the creek. The cabin on the hillside was backed up to a barbed wire fence, where the government property line bagan.   mountianous, heavily wooded, and a field to the east rocky land, with open field towards the west of this field there's a bunch of trees back there that you can only get to by foot . The trees cover the whole west side of the fence line then you can see a small creek running back into these trees  We have a field behind the house.  ALDER SWAMP,CEDERS,DEEP WATER HOLES Alpine enviornment; with the elev. just over 9000' very near treeline, so vegetation was sparse, mostly scrubby alpine pines.  We were camped on a ridgeline seperating Kennedy canyon to the east and a sharp,deep canyon to the west which drains to kennedy lake and eventually leavitt falls. Wooded area swampy creek bottom surrounded by pines and some oaks, maples and beech trees Both times I was on the lake in a boat. In both cases I was near heavily wooded shorelines. The land in this area has pine and oak trees, lots of underbrush like palmettos and berry bushes, and there is a small bridge crossing the creek near the site. Swampy, forested area The area was a new clearcut on a slope in a spruce and fir tree forest.  The creature was sleeping in the grass on the edge of the clearcut, next to the big trees. Concreet bridge High Desert mountian Oak brush Pinion and Ponderosa Pine tree I was on a gravel road when I saw it. The creature was in the woods just a little shy of 100 yards away. The woods there weren't really thick and there isn't much under-growth there at all. The woods were on my left and to my right was a cove off of the Lake of the Ozarks. There was a creek that fed off of the cove that ran behind me under a small bridge and into the woods in front of where the creature was at. Stream; marshy area to the north; forest all around; watershed to the west of the sighting location ; berry bushes in area ; some brush and bushes It was Ponderosa and oak brush, about 3 to 4" snow on the ground, in a Cromo Valley forest..bottom of rich mountain...wooded area on both sides...railroad runs along side of road..no houses or structures in close proximity He was in a clearing in a canyon.

Very Heavy growth....trees,  vines, etc. Highway with woods on one side and pasture/woods on other.  On the peak of a hill. The forest is mixed with red and white oak and maple the predominant tree species. At the top of Davitts Lake (which is a dead end road), there is as the name implies a lake of about 15-20 acres in size. This is the direction from which the assumed bigfoot was coming from, and was running towards some lower laying land where there is a flowing stream and wetland area. The incident occured at about 6000 feet elevation.  The overall climate was arid pine forest with some birch and other deciduous trees along infrequent streams.  The mountain rarely received any rain but always got considerable snow.  Some years glacial patches remained in shadowed areas throughout the summer.  Occasional streams were more often fed by snow melt than by springs.  The draw from which the call originated held one of these streams.  In some areas the soil remained fairly moist due to subsurface frost that persisted into late summer.  The North and East slopes of the mountain are almost bare of trees, the result of hydraulic mining in the late 1800's.  Where water was available, vegetation was plentiful.  Water and vegetation were both abundant in the draw. We were on top of a ridge that ran along an old pond. The ponds was full of dead tree trunks that stuck straight out of the water. The was a swampy area on the opposite side of the ridge. The rest was pretty much pine forest of varying ages and size. Described in context above Wooded, shrubby area - above a steep embankment next to a busy street.  Only structure nearby was her uncle's house. mountians lots of trees rocky Sagebrush bordering farms, pretty flat, but too rough to farm well and maybe 2-3 miles from the beginning of Juniper pine stands and 5 miles before reaching the true base of the Owyhee Mountains.

Deciduous trees, flood plane surrounded by hills, creek, near to Mississippi River bottoms, hilly yet swampy area. logged over Cedar Forest creek bottoms, Mountain Ridge and all  Described in context above. At the end of the road, to the right about 40 feet or so, we camped on the right side slightly down from the far edge of the river bank. Slightly elevated from the sand and rocks of the river bank as it sloped gently to the river. Thick forest, very rugged with many hedgerows and overgrown fields. National Forest. We were camping by the lake and there was still snow pockets in August.

Forrest and river. Somewhat residential, hilly/wooded area, there was an old Montessori nearby. In a cornfield Farm land,pine forest. The incident occurred at Rockbound Res.. Rockbound has alot of granite rocks that come right down to the shoreline. There are scattered pines and firs around the lake. We were camped near where the water runs out of the lake and down to Buck Island Lake. The forest he walked into was a pine forest. If you walk a ways into the forest about a mile it takes you to a huge gravel pit.  Very thick woods. No one anound except us for miles.  Beaver ponds, steep ridges on both sides, thick forrest. Grass field next to a River rolling hills, Osage Creek Approaching the location, there is a small wooded tract which ends at the edge of a marshy, wetlands area. A small creek (Burnt Meadow Brook)runs through it which consists of marsh type grass, low brush and some sporadic trees. Continuing east the area remains wetlands with a predominance of tall reeds before transitioning back to a wooded terrain. The entire marsh area is perhaps 200-250 yards wide and perhaps 1/4 mile deep before ending at the commercial area.  The woods it somewhat dense. There is a river about 1000yrds from the sighting. There are alot of big farms owned by city people that no one lives on. They are all growd up with vegitation. Beside a baseball backstop in the playground of a schoolyard (Kindergarten to Grade 9).

It was thick second growth hard wood forest in the Catoctin Mountains, Marylands portion of the Appalachians.  Hardwoods, river bottom Sullivan lake is nestled in between dense forested mountains. It is where the big-horn sheep winter. The banks are very steep and it is very unpopulated.  It is A very large lake that took us all day to kayak and we never saw any other boaters. The only human interaction with it seemed to be where the campground area is, and the highway on the opposite side. VERY BEAUTIFUL!  Desert. Clear cuts and second growth forest. Top of the hill. Large trees inside Wayne National Forest.  Very dark due to thickness of forest. Open rairoad tracks on a hill. There are trees and thick brush on both sides of the hill.   lots of cotten wood trees by the river thickly wooded. Pine/hardwood second growth forest with a large pond and swamp Mountainous The footprints were on the crest of a large hill used from sledding.  To the south is a fency which seperates the Country Club land from a T.V. tower.  The area has a few trees, rolling hills, and gold greens. A Forested Ravine of Pine and Oak This was an open bean field which had a wooded area on the east side of it. The terrain in the area is rolling hills with open crop fields nearby with large heavily wooded areas of forests. The siting itself happened in a populated area with several houses and a State highway within sight. The back of the property where this happened sloped off to a ravine approximately 100 yards away with the terrain rising from there into hills and woods.   Small valleys.  Hardwood forests cover most of the area, but there are some fields planted with crops such as soybeans and also a few small cow pastures.  The duck River runs through the area.  The forests in the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge are more dense.  The Tennessee River also runs through the refuge.  Thre are few houses.  Many small dirt roads probably made by logging companies.   It was farm land and heavily wooded areas. Well the Smoky mountains were practically in my back yard. I lived on 100 acre ranch in the mountains or woods I guess you could say. The Haiwasse river was about ten miles away. The landscape was very remote and as forested as Tennessee can get.  My closest neighbor was about 2 miles away. I was in the middle of nowhere.   The terrain was described as remote old growth timber, with deep carpet of pine needles, beside a small river, just around dark.  there are stands of pine trees next to the highway, and a ravine that leads up to hill of huge boulders, and rock piles. The environment was very urban but yet rural.  There was one part of the road that was occupated by many people.  The othjer was endless wildlife.  We saw it on the rural/urban margin area. Lots of woods. Mostly tulip popalors, cedars, pines, and oaks. Rolling hills. One old house which nobody has lived there for as long I can remember and the old folks can remember. There is a few creeks and about two miles north is the Cumberland River.   lightly-moderate woods embankment river bottom remote area pasture feilds thats all i know This is a country road going through a wooded area bordering on Gov. land and a large lake. There are untold hundreds of acres filled with wildlife. sparsely forested pine and cedar.....near Percy priest lake   The incident occurred in the Hatchie River bottom.  the area consists of mainly hardwood timber and has numerous creeks and sloughs running through it. The channel was over it's banks, because there was Weeping Willow type trees in water, and grasses that normally would not grow in standing waters. We trolled quietly and slowly further back. About 100 yards before coming to some fallen trees which would have probably presented a passing. I saw no dirt embankments. Looked swampy and had more beauty and a calming effect the deeper we got until what happened. It was the last thing we expected to experience fishing.   There was a small stream that flowed Approximately 30 or so yards from the creature. The area was heavily wooded with hardwood, and still is to this day. There is a larger stream, Lick Creek, which was approximately 100 or so yards from the creature. At the time there was a one lane steel bridge that crossed Lick Creek. The area is predominately farm land interspersed with woodlands.  This area of Deleware is primarly flat, coastal.   The terrain in the area is rolling hills with open crop fields nearby with large heavily wooded areas of forests. The siting itself happened in a populated area with several houses and a State highway within sight.

Around clearing is alot of alder and douglas fir and lots of ground cover, salal. Woods are very thick and hard to see into. back of property borders to *edited* forest. After that it is the Puget Sound.  Very rocky Sierra pine forest. A good portion of this area is practically unwalkable. We heard the screams about 50 yards up hill from us coming from the thickest part of the terrain, moving down river from us. Just the hwy and a fenceline. It had been raining and the tall grass on the other side of the fence looked as if somebody had walked there recently. The Black Hand Gorge area which is heavily wooded with small ponds and rock formations throughout the area.   Sighting area was timbered and adjacent to a meadow and a creek.  The yell area is rocky terrain with sparse growth, but with some heavy timber and vegetation near the stream. Near a  ridgeline. Woods but swampy leading to rocky heights.  There are a lot of farms in the area. Heavily wooded mostly.    Very near house in open area between wooded ridge and open field.

Many large trees, small trees and other vegetation. It would be very easy for someone to get lost,or hide out and never be seen. That's why most of those people live out there.   Swampy, with nearby farms. grassy back yard,  next to a creek adjacent to a rich thick forest.. it was around houses and the area was coverd by farm land and wooded area. Typical southern Oregon forest (small trees, medium heavy brush) except that there was a forest fire that was ongoing, leaving scorched open areas and some small unattended fires that were not far from the road. The road was opened only intermittently and we drove in between closures. Wayne Natyional Forest was our backyard. HEAVY WOODED SOME WHAT SWAMPY ON DIRT ROAD The strip mine has ridges, swamps, two stocked ponds, mostly pine trees up to our property then birch, oak and maple. Some step hills, there is also a natural spring behind our house. There are railroad tracks at the farthest end of the strip mine which would allow a large animal to come and go into the area without a problem. The tracks have not been used in years. The incident occured right in front of that house where a picture window looks out aboout 35ft. from the road(224th street east) Hilly / mountainous area in northern New Mexico; forested; fairly isolated. Like I said mostly pine forest, in a mountainous area. Some meadows in some areas. low lying bottom near a large creek lots of heavy wooded acres It was a swampy, wooded area by a creek.  The ground was covered in leaves and vegetation. The area is part of a large tract of oak and pine forest stretching North from Grantsberg. Tground is sandy.  Nearby is Crex Meadows Wildlife refuge, and to the west is the upper St. Croix river. wet lake yard, between house trailer and lake.. mostly open with tall grass and marshy area... The area is heavily forested with a large number of deer and other wild game in the area.  It is near the Trinity River and that area of the river is very heavily fished almost all year round.

Occurred in a sort of valley in an old fallen in cabin. Heavily wooded and several marshes near Fairly dry for the pacific north west, dry, warm August night. Dense,old growth cedar trees.Gold creek runs between the road and the cabin site. There is a narrow draw behind and to the left of the camp site with a spring running marsh to the left along base of hill to the west. This is the area where it was standing. It was between the marsh area and the cabin site.   pine forest on lake  Pine forest, fairly thick,and low brush. Open grassy meadow there. Big white boulder rock in the meadow. Creek somewhere nearby, perhaps within a 1/4 mile paralleling the trail. Thickly forested hills in eastern Ohio surrounding a 1500+ acre lake..  There is mostly farmland and prairie, but along the river (Apple River, I believe) there are pine forests and other trees, and some larger forests. My sighting was very near the river (about 300 feet or so), and very near a small pond and RR tracks. Incident occurred in area approximately 3500 feet west of coastline (Atlantic Ocean) in very dune-like, saw-grassy, scrubby pine, beach like environment the river has high weeds around it.the road has a high bank on it, Lake surrounded by small willow-type trees.  This area was all cliffs and woods.

This is a mature oil field in a sparsely settled agricultural and ranching environment, there are lots of coyotes, bobcats, badgers, owls, whippoorwills, snakes, and assorted country critters. The entire area is composed of small working cattle operations around a half section or so in size. The area is rolling hay meadows with section line roads every mile or so, with the occasional blind section. The area the creature came from is owned by one of the larger landowners (now deceased), and is less developed than the adjoining acreage. The area it crossed into is perhaps the most inaccessible acreage in the region.  The section of Sly Park road where the sighting occured is residential on the west side and dense forest on the East side. Back then the area was primarily mixed evergreen and deciduous woods with lots of understory of blackberries, salmon berry, wild plum and other NW bushes.  There are a number of wetlands in the immediate vacinity.  We had a pond which is now dried up, our neighbor had a pond (still do) and the swamp where the creature came from was a haven for wetland birds.  Around March all these ponds are full of frogs mating and laying eggs, which ducks and herons would feed on.  There was a large amount of undeveloped land all around.  We had an orchard and many of the people in the area including us raised chickens, rabbits and goats.   The fruit trees tended to draw deer.  At night we would sometimes hear something large leaning on the goat gate, grunting and rattling it.  We assumed it was a bear.  Oak tree covered Mountain Douglas Fir forest. Very little underbrush. Wooded both sides of road.

The field was about 100-150 yards across, and a small two lane road ran one side of it.  On two other sides, were homes.  There was one remaining side that was forest.  That forest was quite large at that time, and even now is still quite undeveloped.  It was mostly pines near the field, but became mostly oaks on the mountain nearby.  The ditch I was in when I spotted him ran across the field and sometimes had water in it, but it had dried up due to a dry spell.   It occurred in a Hood River Valley orchard of mixed, mature apple and pear trees. The orchard is about 1 mile east of a small, thickly-vegetated ravine where the Hood River flows, and where the forest begins.  Pine trees and oak brush;  Mountain side The pond was somewhat swampy but still with fresh water and it was surrounded by pine trees except for the area that I could see from my car.

This is a very large crop field that has a small area of crop at the far end between patches of forest. It's near a creek bottom and swampy area. The property is loacated at the foot of a large hill and it is a  wooded area. Mostly Evergreen trees suround the area. Their property is an open field on one side, trees on the other and a large tract of woods in the back. The property across the street drops of dramatically into a large ravine with a small creek. The creek then leads into a much larger hollow that has a good size stream running through it with heavily wooded hillsides going for miles to the Northeast. Typical foothills of the Appalachians.

Numerous river bottoms and creeks cut through the hills with considerable and thick vegetation. Easy to get lost if you do not have any wood sense. Black bears are here in considerable numbers as well turkey, deer, other small animals. We were told that many locals have seen a large black panther skulking the woods. It was right off the dirt road that I was riding on. I was on a hillside covered in deciduous trees. Across the road is very thick wooded area near Little Punderson Lake and Punderson State Park. Deciduous and evergreen forest before the leaves were starting to come back after winter. A lake was nearby (about 20 yards). A hill led to the lake.   The Trinity River is in the area of 1008. They have pine and swampy areas. Cedar trees, sandy loam soil.  Many rocks and ledges to climb, and easy access to the Brazos River.   The ridge is not what I would call very densely wooded.  however, as you go farther down the slope, sparse trees, and granite outcroppings give way to more dense stands of pines and manzanita brush.  There was a lot pine trees and in a few places very dense under growth.  We drove down what appeared to be an old logging road. The area is a mixture of overgrown clear cut with a stream (Milk Creek) running through it there is a mixture of heavy brush and trees with swampy bog land running along the stream. There are several ponds in the area and the immediate surrounding area is forest land and some minor farm land.

On the east side, grass knee high 20 ft. to fence 4 ft. high on the other side of fence grass chest high for 50 yds. to tree line. Lake launch ramp with thick treeline above lake line. across the river, wooded, not two deep but unable to see more that 75 yards or more on one side with steep slope against the hill side on the other. the hill climb was intermittent trees and bushes until I got to were the noise started. Then started to get thicker. the envirement is lots of woods that stretch for miles anlong the lake ontario and ny state pkwy location was next too small pond also the area has somw wet lands swampy Hills and Cliffs near the woods Scrub and small trees and saplings. Thicker forest to the North. There's an old limestone quarry about a half mile farther back that's filled with water. The whole area back there used to be quite thickly forested by a large area of woods At Fanno ridge right next to Fanno Peak The area where we have our farm is a transitional forest, with white pin, many maples, ash, oaks, etc. There are streams and several ponds, one pond is about 15 acres.

Flat area with trees, brush, logging roads, meadows, creeks.  There is an access road from HW 135 that travels off to the left through a wooded area, the trees thin out near the water, then turns to sand and extends out to form the sand bar. I would say the the sand bar is roughly 150 to 200 yards from the bridge. I'm not agood judge of distance however.  it was very thick old growth forest.   Mountainous forest, snowmobile trail up hill, creek downhill. Area is rural northern Mn on site of an old farm...close to state hwy...river nearby and lakes within a mile and a half.   It was mostly aspen and pine and there were a lot of deadfalls around. We were in a saddle of 2 hills on the east slope. The lake was on the west side of the hills. My place is a saddle between two steep hills with a spring fed creek coming through it from up the hill. Across the street to the North is a remote area of old strip mines and is sparsely populated for miles. Up the hill to the South is very rugged and gives access to other remote areas with only gravel roads through it. State Route 151 and 250 run through the area.

Pine forest/semi wetland  forest about an acre of cleared land surrounded by heavily wooded areas, backed by a powerline break. After doing a little research I found that the place we were at was named "Devil's Half Acre" and was perhaps the historical site of Fort Deposit along the Oregon Trail.  We were just north of the campground along the eastern edge of the meadow.  The creature sighted was on the other side, the west side of the meadow. scrub oaks tall pine creeks to river A very minor, small creek formed the west edge of my camp perimeter.  Maybe 100 yards to the east, over a slight knoll was another lone vehicle/tent (but didn't see the person(s) upon driving up, then back down to my site).  The whistling came from my east, northeast and southeast respectively.  Northeast was the whistle that was loudest and came closest.  Southeast was right by the road and heard last - repeated but didn't move until it all stopped abruptly after about a minute. The campsite was open, compacted duff beneath spaced giant second-growth.  Below me was the braided floodplain margin with dense young alders and willows.  Foliage returned to dense between campsites and surrounding slope other side of Tinkham Road.   The incident took place in a old field that borders Jim Creek. A thick band of Salmonberry, Alder, Thimbleberry and Blackberry separates the field from the creek bed.  The far side of the creek (was) mature 2nd growth that mixes with stands of Alder and Maple, Cedar and Hemlock. The forest floor was thick Salmonberry and other brush. The entire area was logged off in 1996. The area is a good mix of low lying area's, farms, and dense woods. Would be a really great area for deer hunting. possibly fox as well. Wooded. I couldn't see any particular water sources, but this whole area is nothing but ponds, lakes, rivers, and creeks. There would be abundant water sources all around the area. There were cattle ranches and cattle dairies all through that area.    Pre cambrian shield, rocky with Pine Forest house in middle of old fruit orchard, surrounded by pretty dense woods The enviroment is like almost any other in the area very wooded with different types of tree and brush very heavily populated with small game and deer at the time.

Forest, shallow river with salmon running. Farm fields (soybean, corn, pasture and yard/lawn) with some nearby homes. All of the forest around us was probably a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees as well as small areas of wild grass fields around the gravel pit. The gravel in the area was a little bigger than pea gravel.  I remember there was no dead wood (for a campfire) near the grvel pit or at the forest edge which makes me think it was relatively new growth. swamping land, low lying area, big pines, and some fields near by.

The woods are very thick and competely circle the property.Theres only one way in one way out.There is a nearby highway and a wildlife refuge two miles northwest.I would say the town of many is two miles south. A trail about eigt to ten feet wide.  I assume it used to be an old logging road of some kind.  It was abandoned and the floor of it was very sandy.  Unlike the surrounding forest it was very quiet to walk on since there was little vegitation except for the wild strawberry's that grew everywhere.

Many many pine trees and woods and a lake w/ many cows.  I've mapped the area by natural community 'cover types'.  Essentially, the forested areas are  Beech-maple mesic forests with scattered occurrences of the Hemlock-northern hardwood forest community, particularly on western and northern slopes.  Lesser occurrences of the Pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit community are found near ridge and hill tops dominated bny rock outcroppings.  If you want the all of the details on these communities, you can look up them up in the following reference:  "Edinger, G.J., D.J. Evans, S. Gebauer, T.G. Howard, D.M. Hunt, and A.M.

Mountain area with very heavy forest and thick underbrush.There were very big trees. It is surrounded by cliffs on all sides except one and that is how you get there. This specific area is fir forest, but very nearby there are areas of large ponderosa pine (very parklike), mountain mahogany, and juniper/sage.  The area is cut by numerous spring-fed streams that flow year round as well as intermittent runoff creeks.  Approximate elevation: 5500 ft. Cornfield, irrigation ditch  Mixed hardwoods & swamp.

Covered in report. 24 acre property, of which a 7 acre field was carved into a 2.5 acre yard, that bordered the wooded treeline.  Lots of wildlife, including rabbits, squirrels, coyotes, whitetail dear. Forested on top of the mountain, the road was separated by a small hill in between the directions of travel. I was headed east. Just off a paved bike trail, in pretty thick brush with a lot of deadfall on the ground. Around the first house there's a lot of trees below and between the houses. The neighborhood is on a hill above Hwy 70.    The other place, where my trailer is, is very brushy . A lot of pine trees down in a valley.

Base of Black Mountain near Boulder Creek; very dense & thick woods. Horse Creek drainage just above confluence with Granite Creek.  Thick creek bottom with ferns, devil's clubs, aspen and cedar. The area was pretty thick with redwoods and undergrowth and the river was to my right. The area has some Juniper trees and alot of sagebrush. The road was packed dirt and the area off of the road is sandy, that was why we could see the footprints easily, The Sagebrush Bar is about 1/2 mile to the East of the location. Wooded.

"This sheer-walled canyon shelters rare Arctic-alpine plants along its boulder laden floor, where snow often persists until late spring. From two platforms and a network of boardwalks and trails, view this spectacular gorge and feel the air rising from the depths." Pine and fir forest, lots of trees. There is a spring just up the road about 1/2 mile that has a pipe that runs ice cold fresh spring water year round. we were only about 50 feet from Big Creek.and its really cold year round Also lots of mountains and valleys. Probably 15 miles to the nearest cabin. Very quiet there, area not used very much, too far from the river for most people.  FARM FIELD ALONG CREEK OFF OF STATE RT56 AND HOUSTIN PIKE Oak brush, forest and pine tress Typical Eastern Washington Forest. Campsite area was clear of vegetation...trees large pine tree were mixed in....undergrowth outside camp was dense, thick and green. Light wooded area but heavy wooded area very close.  This area has rolling hills, small canyons, etc... The lake was surrounded by miles of mature forest and was seldom visited a that time. It is only accessible by one road which continues past the lakes to extensive logging loads typical of this country. The area is lowland with numerous marshes punctuated by steep round hills. The area does not receive persistent snow cover. The land has since been logged and a large church camp built along the shore. The forest was replanted and appears to be about 10 years old. The state map indicates Hannon Lake has fish but State Fish & Game does not list it as a fishing lake possibly because it is now privately owned.  National Forest. Heavily wooded, fairly remote.

Object was on a concrete porch of a ranch house looking into a bedroom window. No other objects on or near the porch. next to Tenaya Lake with a mtn next to the lake , the sound came from the side of the mtn. and then apparently the thing came running down by the campsites There was a wooded area off to the side of the road where he was standing, and there was a railroad track bridge, a freeway overpass, and a deer crossing sign nearby. edge of bush crownland go for 100's of miles nothing but bush to the north  miles of forest lots of pine trees and rivers and lots of rolling ground and hills Very woodsy.

A treeline with a creek/ditch in the middle near the river with fields all around. Camp spot is a little open clearing. Road from camp spot continues South into forest. They blocked off with a dirt berm. If you go into the forest to the East, there are some big older trees and the forest is kind of flat and dried up marshy land.The camp spot has been used as a hunting camp based on the 2 deer hanging logs hung up in the tree. There is also some stashed homemade wood tables, shelves under plastic and downed trees to the East of the spot about 80 feet in. There is also a makeshift wood/tarp outhouse.There is a steep ridge on the North side of the site.   In a community of houses near a highway. Also near Siksika Golf Resort.

Reclaimed strip mines, lots of pine trees, a large lake on one side and a smaller lake on the other side Thick woods, Oak mostly, A lot of heavy brush, Between Missouri River and the levee.  Fir forest, hiking paths, creek below trail... We were in a small valley with a 15-20 foot wide stream running through it.  The track we were driving on crossed the stream and kept going.  The landscape was grassy and cleared where we were but right across the stream from us, and to the right of the track, was a small, steep hillside, densely wooded with evergreens, where I had the sensation of being watched from.  It seems like the small valley was surrounded by forest. Fairly forested and hilly area.  Wooded environment with a creek running through to the Nooksack River The area is beautiful pine forest mountains with wide open sagebrush at the bottom of the "basin."  Campsite was at the base of a valley right next to Lake Creek.  As you follow the creek upstream the woods get very dense.  Many very large boulders in the area from the northeastern ridge above which is a granite rockface about 10,000 feet elevation. Bitter brush hill side, with the ditch bank running though it, cotton wood trees here and there, if you are interested call or write, I work for the U.S.F.S and can describe very graffically every aspect of the sighting.

Figure sighted on the open beach during a storm.  In 1988 this area was largely undeveloped woods.  The few small communities between Tuscaloosa and Centreville were basically nothing more than old country roads marked by flashing yellow lights and reduced speed signs along with the occasional country stores common in the rural south.  The area where my sighting occurred was largely pine forest on both sides of the road with narrow shoulders and few places to safely pull off the road.  There is a creek(Bear Creek) on the south side of the highway that runs parallel to the road for a few miles. The highway is built up so that it sits a few feet above the level of the forest floor.  The area is somewhat hilly and the road has a number of zigs and zags as it runs alongside this creek. Redwood forest, around 1200 ft in elevation.    the road is rural dotted by houses here and there but in spots is very wooded. If you come to open fields it passed where we spotted the creature.  It ran from in front of a house that has several trees in front of it. It disappered into thick brush across the street. Dense forest, Mixed with Coniferous+ Deciduous trees, heavy with raspberry and alder undergrowth, a lot of deadfall too.   Sighting occured on the floor of the bottom secton of the hollow.

We were camped in the thick timber at the edge of the meadows around the lake.  The tree line was at about 10,500 ft and we were camped at about 9800 ft. Interstate   We were on a trail, which dropped off steeply to our right.  The trail was in a clear grassy area, with occasional single scrub trees.  The drop off was heavily wooded with considerable underbrush. The hill behind the house, Ferguson Gultch runs all year along the side of the property.  We live in the Klamath National Forest mostly fir and some hardwoods. High altitude, park-like meadow of stunted fir.  Deep woods with heavy underbrush. No houses.

Trail runs between ridge line and river.  Sparse trees on ridge, some willows and smaller-type trees follow the course of the river.  Standing on the trail facing the meadow you can see an open-faced building on the right, way across the meadow. The thing came from the left, turned at almost a 90 degree angle and went away from us toward the far side mountain.   Mostly wooded area with small developments of housing.  These are ridges and hills that deer live in and others say they have seen a bear locally. We were on the shoulder of the mountain, looking westward onto the meadow and climax forest.  The meadow was about due west, while the forested area is about south-west.  The shoulder that we were on stands about 300 feet above, and about 1/2 mile from the meadow. There are two water features on this property that may be of interest. A large crerk,"I" Creek, and a thermal spring that creates a nice pool where it emerges from the base of a maple tree in my yard. The spring winds down through the blackberries about 50 feet where it falls into the creek. Note that there are many trees and willows in the yard that through years of weight from blackberry vines have bent over and now form many "rooms under the foliage. Some of these are quite large.  ENVIRONMENT from Report # 12910: I have around one and a half acres with a spring and a creek. The wilderness to the coast at Crescent City starts across the street from my house. There are lots of blackberries and fruit trees on my property. There are bent willows trees covered in blackberries that make nice places for big animals to hide...

It is between 2 mountains so I guess its a mountain bottom.  The trees were turning to Pine Trees at this point. It's a canyon with a small river in the bottom.  But as you get higher there are cliffs & ridges.  Not far up from the river there are pinyon & juniper that gradually turn into larger pine and aspen the farther up you go. very forested, pine, evergreen, short bushes, hills, grassy hillside It's really hilly, a few trees.

Pine forest in a swamp, pretty much the same as the whole Ft. Stewart vicinity   River bank, so rocks and pebbles. Where the incident happened the river cut through and we were on one side on the rocks and on the other side was dense trees and underbrush.  Field surrounded by wooded areas.  There was a stream that is part of Beaver Creek that ran through the woods. This farm was heavily forested with pines and thickets. The river was next to it. We would go down to the river and play. That is how close we were to the river. We did not have any close neighbors. This was the kind of area where people lived miles from each other.

The area is a desert with scrub brush and dirt. near forest, flat land It was atop one of the highest elevations in the area. I have a  picture of that location . The photo can give you an idea of the  topography and native vegetation (can email if requested). To be  more specific it was a slope of a mountain that had been logged.  From the road to the top of the slope was about 150 yards. I was  about mid-way up about  75-100 yards to the peak or top. Where I  was standing was a clear cut area about 10 to 15 years ago, called 'early successional' habitat in forestry terms.   Within this early successional habitat is much Rubus ursinus (wild blackberry), Betula alleghaniensis (Yellow birch) and Prunus serotina (Black cherry) and Smilax rotundifolia L. (green Brier). This slope had large rocky outcroppings especially near the top where the sound came from. Down below there was a valley  with a stream (have a picture if requested) about 300 yards  below. At the top of the slope all the vegetation was left and  it continued behind and away. Only the slope I was on was clear  cut about 40 acres. Above on the top of the slope were a mix of pine and hardwood forest species, mainly Suga canadensis (L.) (Eastern Hemlock), and Spruce. The top of this slope had well  beaten down game trails. I remember this specifically because I  am a hunter and look for these kinds of things. There was a lot  of exposed soil, packed dirt. No tracks were seen and no foul smells.   A field surronded by mature second growth forest.  Rural with some farms and quite a bit of merchantable sized forest left in the area.

The environment is trees but not many and right near a rodeo ground and near some homes that are in the trees.  A river runs nearby.  There is some willow patches with water and irrigation.  Right now the run-offs are coming down as the snow is melting.  We have had much colder days in the higher elevations and some snow in May.  It is unusually colder and then we get sweltering days of sunshine. It is different this year. Forest area hilly not very populated. There is a bridge nearby.  Hardwoods with a creekbottom below to my right. Heavy woods, streams, farms, feilds, lakes, swamps Low brush and fairly thick cedars.  About 1/2 mile from the barn at the DK Ranch.

Remnants of some type of old mines and railroad tressels. Open meadows surrounded by mixed conifer forest and aspen groves, the elevation is about 9200 feet.  Hart Prairie is unusual in dry Arizona in that it has many springs and is a moist area which naturally attracts wildlife.  This area is just down slope from the Arizona Snowbowl and the Nature Conservancy has a preserve on part of Hart Prairie.  Species diversity is rich compared to most surrounding areas.  However, there are many more people at this spot compared to the rest of the Peaks, including several homes and the ski resort. top of the mountain  brushy with pines  and quakies The area is a mix of vast pine forest, tidal swamp, and farms. This area is abundant with corn, tomato, potato,and wheat fields. There is a huge deer population and large chicken feed lots with chickens that get loose and huge feed bins. In my opinion this area could support a very large population of primates. There at first seems to be a large population of people, but they only live on the road sides and not in the woods.

Higher ground mostly pine and poplar inbetween swampy areas with tag alders. very thick.If there was ever a place for something like this to be I guarentee you this is it. No one ever goes there but us. Campground is mixed meadow and lodgepole pines at 9,700 feet on the east side of the Sierra Nevada crest.  The campground is on a rise overlooking a meadow with Lee Vining creek running through the midst.  As one progresses westward up the canyon, one enters lodgepole pine forest.  Eventually, the trail that the campground is on rises out of the valley through the alpine tundra scrub, granite domes, cliffs, and rock falls to the top of 12,500 foot Mt. Conness, which crowns the Sierra crest west of the camp.  I took many digital photos of the area around our camp. Mountain ridge Forrest with a brook near by.

Pine This is Red Fir forest, at about 8,000 feet in elevation. The site is adjacent to a creek with a thick mountain alder thicket. The canopy was full, so the light was not that great.  This red fir stump is distinctive, very large, it would take several people to reach around it. It is broken, perhaps eight feet above the ground, and the massive trunk lies in two pieces that run toward the east.
