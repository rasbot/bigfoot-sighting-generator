About 5:00PM I was approaching my Uncles farm yard with my tractor and load of bales. At a distance of about 4 hydro poles I noticed what I thought was my uncle walking on the right hand side of the road away from me.As I got closer he appeared to turn and look toward me, then turn away and walk across the road.At this point it stuck me as strange that he looked to be wearing a heavy dark winter coat as it was about 15 C outside.Just as he disappeared behind a steep hill on the left side of the road I looked toward the yard and saw my uncle walking up to his house and realized it wasn't him. At the point were the being disappeared behind the hill on the left side of the road is on the east side of a steep hill, with my uncle's house being on the west side of the hill. On the east side of the hill were the being disappeared was were I was stacking bales and arrived there maybe 2 minutes after the being had crossed. No one was there, still thinking this was a person I parked and walked over the hill to the house expected they had done the same. My Uncle informed me that no one had come to the yard. Now wondering what was going on we took the truck and did a search of the area we saw nothing. The closest heavy bush to that area would be a 1/4 mile away. As I replayed the incident in my mind it seams to me that this being was almost as tall as a tree on the right hand side of road were it crossed about 8 feet tall I'm not sure. I am sure it appeared to have a dark coat and remember thinking that the turn and the gait were not just right. The dogs at the yard were barking a lot when I left for home later towards dark but didn't seem to what to leave the steps of the house.The weather at the time was clear and sunny.I didn't find this incident unsettling but the more I think about the stranger it seems. I only wish I had seen my uncle in the yard sooner as I would have paid closer detail to the figure on the road.   Clear, cold, dark night About 11:00 p.m., there was no moonlight and it was so dark I could only see a few feet in front of me at night  almost dusk, around 4-430pm.

Not a cloud in the sky.  Bright reflections off of granite rock faces. Light breeze. In april of 1991 my exwife and I were on vacation headed to Crescent City, CA. The reason I remember the date is because I called my mom on that trip to wish her a happy birthday. Driving up the 101 we saw the ave of the giants scenic rout sign so not being in a hurry we took it headed north. Now I'm not sure ot the exact location but between two small towns maybe five miles north of where this gift shop that is actually carved out of a living redwood tree is (I hope that helps) there is a small parking lot off to the right where you can park and walk along some trails that I believe run parallel to the highway. I think the area is intended for day use only. well, we stopped and took a walk down this trail just to take in some of the scenery when about 200 yards down the trail my wife began to get this feeling something was off to the right. I told her it was her imagination when all of a sudden from that direction came this yell or howl that made my skin crawl. It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled. The howl itself sounded halfway between a human voice yelling "Ahhhhhh" and the high pitched sound of an elk. It wasn't an elk or human or bear as near as I can tell though and what ever it was moved very fast. We didn't see anything though but we got the distinct feeling weren't welcome in the area. As it seemed to get to what seemed to be around 75 yards away we ran back to the car and promptly left. We never could figure it out so we just dropped the subject. My ex is a superstitious sort and at first started trying to explain it away as a ghost which me want to drop the subject even quicker. But the issue has always unsettled me and when I heard some of the recordings of bigfoot screams on this or some other b.f. website, one in particular was exactly like what I heard that day. I still don't know what it was of !! or sure but I'll never forget it  Early morning hours, perhaps 3am Morning. time--late afternoon 4 pm condition- clear with three to four mph breeze as it was hot in the fields but the stream water through the farm was cold enough to keep our beers cold and the boss didn't mind.

On June 25th at 6:10 PM, I was driving back from the ranch on Johnson's Creek Road off of Bald Hills Road in Northern California. I was about 2 miles from Bald Hills Road on Johnson's Road. I noticed in the forest a movement on my right. Then I noticed a large man-sized being, striding very fast away from the road. Then it jumped off an embankment. The early evening air was clear with sunlight showing through the forest. The being looked brown and gold in the forest and sunlight. When I went by, there was a bunch of dust in the air, where the being jumped off the embankment. I drove a little ways and came out onto the prairie. The creature was very fast and took long strides. It was just before dark and the sun was going down but it was still light enough to see well. The weather was clear and warm.

I'm glad there is a website where I can share my story. I hope many others will continue to do the same thing. There doesnt seem to be anything in the media on this subject anymore, dont know why but it should be brought out as much as the UFO phenomenon. I cant believe a large creature like this can go undetected or caught in this day and age. If I had the money and backing I would put a serious hi-tech search for the creature. Hopefully this elusive man beast will be tracked down  in our lifetimes putting to rest the skeptics and silliness surrounding the bigfoot issue.

About 11:00 P.M. Early morning Between noon and 2pm, clear, sunny and around -10 degrees Celsius I had went and hung a stand on a tree the day before,for hunting deer.  In an area around north sardis lake on public land.I knew I was the only person in there, because of the trails hadnt been used for some time.I rode in about 2 miles in and then walked about 300 yards to where I had hung my climber. It was just about day break, Iwas 20 or so feet up a pine tree when I heard what sounded like someone beating a stick against a tree. I spotted some movement in the area the sound came from,What ever it was was brown and tall,my first thought was its a bear.I was using my binoculars,but it was about 200 yards from me and dawn.So I pulled up my rifle to look threw the scope,hoping I could see it better.It wasnt any bear, it didnt have ears on top of its head and its face was flat. It was at least 8 foot tall and stood like a man.and I noticed its skin was grayish/green where the hair was thin. I was so startled I stood up.It turned toward my direction and knew I was there.It leaned Its head back as if smelling  the air, then took off. It move 40 or so yards in a few seconds and was gone.I was shaking badly and climbed straight down.I just coundnt beleive what I had seen.So I started walking in the direction I had seen it.I walked over to a hill where it had slid and left a track. It was a human looking foot track.This scared me because I was trying to tell myself, it was just a bear,then a sound came from the woods that sounded like whoop...whoop.So I hurried back got my stand and left those woods. That has been six years ago, and everytime I told anyone my story. They made fun of me, so I been reserved about letting anyone know, but recently.A freind f mine had an encounter,he doesnt want to let anyone know.Because he thinks people will think hes crazy...

Since we do have black bears, I picked up my grandbaby and we all stepped back as my husband and daughter's boyfriend had a look around. Something crashed away into the woods and was gone. The crazy thing is that the sound was nothing like we had ever heard before and we've been here a long time. I might add that we recently completely fenced the area which makes it even more odd. Accessing the yard would be hard for a bear now.
