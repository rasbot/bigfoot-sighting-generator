What prompted this report is the fact that I now currently reside in Snohomish County Washington and just read about local sightings in my area, surprised at the number of reports. I used to live in Orange County California, and an old girlfriend of mine and I, were camping up in Dutchman\u2019s Flats area, near Idyllwild. We were out-packing, not in a campground.  We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was, but we have never heard that sound before. The screams lasted for probably 5-7 minutes. The whole thing lasted about 10 seconds each.   I am not sure if whatever made the sound was a bear, pack of coyotes, or some other animal. Its relatively short duration and lack of noise make me think it was a man, possibly bear or elk. This happened in the area of Hoosier State Forest, east of Spokane Washington.",

We were driving south of Bears Ears, and turned the car around, when we saw a very large black thing on all fours. It was behind a tree, but it was visible to the car. I don't know how many feet it could have had, but it was huge.  I didn't stop the car.  I didn't even tell him what happened.  He didn't even want to talk about it. I was so damn scared. I've never been so afraid in my life. I have drove past New Hampshire and California, tried to get into interstate 10,000, and I didn't even believe him. He's the same way he is.

I slowed down but didn't seem to be looking in that direction. I viewed it for a second and I turned to look at it. I say peeking over a fence, because I know it was not a rabbit, as I have met several rabbits in this direction.   What I saw just took up a good ten feet of space and was six or seven feet tall.   What struck me at the time was the total lack of any fur; it was black and it was not  a bear, nor a wolf, nor any other four legged animal.   The figure was that of a man, seven feet tall and as wide as the road. It was about black and its head was just above its shoulder that ran along the crest of the hill I was on.   It moved its right arm down in front of its face and swung it back and forth as it walked. Then it stiffened up and got behind a clump of brush.   At this point I am convinced that what ever I saw was a bigfoot. But I do not think that was in a rural setting one in the morning.  ",

We were crossing a creek when the ranch house flipped over a downhill slope on the right side of the road. The ranch house was about 30 feet higher up the mountain than the slide. I was facing the road. Looking down at the slope while climbing the slope, something large/small stood up from a small crouched over position onto the slope. My father asked me what it was. I didn\u0092t know. It was dark by now, only light enough to see better. At the top of the hill, completely beneath our feet, was a hairy humanoid figure. At the bottom, it stood at the same level as my father. This creature was between 5 and 10 feet tall. It was huge, perhaps 6 feet tall. It was dark colored, almost silver. The head was totally covered with hair. The head was like a man\u0092s, not like a gorilla and I am positive we ever saw one. Brighter than the trees. My father was so scared, he will not return to this track. We will never forget. And, if ever, we will do all in our power to leave him deep in the bush, unless there is an official search party. Most people do not believe us. It is because of that attitude towards things that I believe that I have not only experienced some reality checking, but also a serious and informed thought about reality.

I have seen all of Washington's Big Trees and every member of the family that roams the area so I have been hunting all of Maine.

It was about 1:30 pm , It was dark and the woods were slightly quiet. I could hear what sounded to me like a large animal across the woods. I could hear crashing of branches and the roar of theacre, maybe 20 yards away. I looked up over the hill and saw a large apxan at the top of the hill. I could see the outline of this creature, all I could make out was that it was covered with hair, I thought I was seeing things. I decided to retreat and draw my weapon back in and when I looked back over my shoulder I saw it still in the brush. I draw my scope back and try to get it focus again. Then I slowlyALT and cleare back to the house. It was still in the brush and I am now realizing I am losing my mind. There was an odor of a foul odor still covering the air. I slowlyALT and go inside andmares came over me at the same time i could hear my aunt and uncle snorting of hog anddeer I was never afraid of anything but this smell kept me from my home I sat up reading books and listened to recordings of bigfoot that I had never heard before very calm and my ears actually looked asparagus in color. About 2 weeks later I was visiting my friend who lives on the end of the school school school bus, and my friend and I were walking down the road that goes from housing to the bus, when I heard what sounded like a tree being thrown through the woods approx. 1/3 down the hill. The noises where two and one in a hundred. I went into the woods and never saw anything. I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman and I have never heard anything like that. I can tell you I have never heard a noise like that, I have seen many bears in the woods and that was nothing like that. ",

I was looking at it with my eyes and it was a very cold day. The top of my head got very excited and I asked my friend if it was a bear I saw something very strange. He responded that it was too big to be a bear I was the first one to notice this he showed me both pictures and they are exactly the same height. After I told him what I saw he swayed from side to side and said the same thing I saw. He said that it was at least twice as tall as my dad. I was about 8ft tall. It was around 45 to 50yds away and out in the woods I saw it standing there for about 5 seconds before I snapped and started running back to my house.

We went to our spots and within several minutes we heard the first scream. It was quite high pitched and was drawn more attention than it was coming from. We could tell that the screams were very very loud and it had a  feeling. We returned to camp and I heard the screams again several days later.

It ran further back in the snow then I did because it went up a steep slope. This was unusual because deep snowstorms can push your silhouette to the top of the footprint. When I first saw it, the semi-forest aged figure was directly behind about a 5ft. layer of lowland sagebrush. It was amazing to me that I was not being tracked! I immediately noticed that I could see the sasquatch running completely upright across the open grass. It was so close, I thought gereag gator.   I was shocked. This is a Bigfoot that is built around incredible speed and force. I was terrified. This was not a bear. This was a Sasquatch.

About thirty yards beyond that is a squatchy, thicketted stream, probably about a five-mile stretch.

It is roughly a horizontal river, and the squatchiness of the stream flows in relationship to the island. (I suspect a kind of Unification Point)",

In early 2018, while hiking around the Ocala National Forest from another location, I found a partial footprint of a large handprint. The handprint was slightly larger than my foot (maybe 14 inches long) and had a finger like nail at the tip. I noticed in what appeared to be a forward motioning hand that the hand was vigorously waving and bobbing as it moved up and down the mountain. This was strange because no other human who I know had handprints like that. We tried to video tape the handprint, but it too moved halfway up and down the mountain. We didn't find any foot prints after our investigation, which bears repeating is impossible.  We considered the idea that a Bigfoot mightily mantle this camp. However, I've never seen a film of any bigfoot in Florida since 1980. Could it be a shortcut for bigfoots to the Bay Area? I've traveled that same ridgeline and have never heard a word of it.

And while some of the sightings may seem unusual, said Dr. Barak L. M. M., a geology major at New York University at Buffalo, there are many more that indicate the ranger is sincere. \"There is lots of activity here,\" said M.D. \"and I am always catching fish.\" That is when the lake casts a shadow over the shore. Until recently, Dr. M. had never encountered the apparitions of many. Now he says he has, and says he is convinced of them.  \"I tell people every now and then,\" he said. \"I am getting tips and directions for the location.\" Forced passage: a broken water treatment barrier; a rock cliff that protruded nearly 300 feet high near shore; touching rocks on the cliff and/or in the cliff embankment  ( touching rocks on the cliff would also be a height surveyor); and leaping vegetation.

To think I had seen a bear back there two years earlier; never saw any bears since.  I also never told anyone about my sighting until my son came home saying I was crazy and I was nuts. I would never forget that day. ",

Heor me getting in the car. \"I don\u0092t see it, I don\u0092t see it, you scared me off-- get the car.\" Heading me along the road. \"Oooo-- God, get the car! The car! The car! The car! The car!

I would beooked of the flashlight and the car. I would see by his mouth. The way he waspering away and turning away. The howling was coming from more back toward the car. I started to get that feeling of being watched. My father was in the car finishing setting the car. The way he strode along the road he really felt like it. I couldn't see his face that well, but I could hear him walking, scanning the woods. I know he wasat about mid-way point of the gully. I'll call him the archer because he wasnt really tall or broad just tall and bulky. He was just taking the place of a guy he saw a deer, except that he saw them both at once.

I spent most of the evening when I decided to go for a walk across the fields. I walked for about 40 yards as the jugs got bigger and bigger and then I heard a loud rustle noise to my left. I thought I was going to be starein' into a woods behind some cottages. Then I heard what sounded like a large hog snorting. But it wasn't a hog, I thought. I thought if I get stared at I might be able to get a look at an antler.  I stood up and turned around and started walking even more. I began to walk even faster in and was facing away from the woods when all of a sudden a loud cracking sound made me freeze. I couldn't even fall like that..it was like a round had hit me or something. The sound was deep and at its highest detail I was afraid to move. I had every hair standing on end as I fell. It happened so quickly that the next day I did not bother going back and checking it out anything. I know it was years before I told anyone, but I have seen many things that I have never told anyone before that I am convinced that bigfoot or sasquatch or whatever is real. I'll also be checking out your site and other'S TOOLS TOO COOL. WE STILL COULDN'T STOP.IT SEEMED like a tipped over tree. WE PARKED THE CAR AND RAN ACROSS THE STREET TO WHERE HE WAS AND HE TOLD ME TO Obey HIS FEATURES. AS IT TURNED,I CAME OUT OF THE CAR TO ASK IF IT WAS IN THE DARK. AS THE CAR LIGHTS HIM UP I NOTICEED THAT HE WAS LOOKING AROUND US. HE TALKED TO ME OVER THE PAINFUL SCREAMS. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AS I STILL HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS SOUND before.

He was light brown in color, happing to look like a gorilla..we actually seen one do it real close to me.  It just stood in front of the car lights for 3 or 4 seconds when it turned to face the car.  I actually seen what I think was a heavy breathing rhythm, like it was running away from the car.  I was scared to death.  It was the scariest moment of my life.  I had never heard of bigfoot or any other big wild animal.  It watched me for 3 minutes, I was out of my mind and I had never in my life seen anything like that.  I called my son and told him to come home.  It was dark now in august and it was a full moon.  I have a new computer which does a good job of displaying all the pictures...when I heard this sound it freaked me out.  I played them and they moved a little closer in the next clip.  There he is again, eyes open as I tried to talk to him:  I got to the top of his head, I did not lose sight of him.  He was at the very edge of the road.  He was about\ufffd 5.  I could only see his head and shoulders and a lot of fur.  He was about\ufffd 6.  Then he took off, I thought, we're going to have to get after him, I'm just positive we're going to get out of there.  We didn't speak the whole time.

I had rifle deer hunting, they had flashed me about a deer and they both heard something like a loud grunt. I shined my flash spotlight over to the woods and nothing. About 30 minutes after the grunt noise stopped I heard three woops coming from the woods just off my field of vision. I shined the light on the area I was looking and nothing. The third time I saw it walking just noticed me and didn't really pay attention to it other than to point at the woods. I finally picked up a rock I had found a while back and turned around with my binoculars but didn't see anything. I looked around the woods a little more and noticed a patch of grass beside a spring and a clump of palmetto of scrub trees with a sheer rock over it. I looked around and second thought I had spooked a deer. As I watched, I noticed that it wasn't the first time I had seen something walk across that grass or step off the trail.

On the first day of this year, I saw something much more remarkable; I couldn't believe my eyes.   It was maybe 3:30 in the morning when I was in my car going South on Turner Road, when I saw what I described as a \"Bigfoot\" walking across the road. It was about 3:20 a.m. when I was driving, and I came around the last curve of the road and it was gone. I saw it for about 10 seconds, before it went into the trees.   I immediately looked at my friend, who was driving and said, \"Did you see that?\" He replied that he had. I asked him what it was and he didn't know, but said that it was big, hairy, and quick. It walked out of the woods along the fence line into the forest. I didn't say anything about it afterwards, because I didn't know what to do.

So I made my way to the top of the hill.wise you could see the trail was around an hour and I was alone. So I made my way over to the trail and walked in front of it. I made my way in the right direction and started to smell this odor. It smelled like wet dog, urine smell or something so I sort of gave it my scent. Then I heard movement on the top of the hill. I backtracked through the swale and didn't see anything. I thought that it was just my luck but as I approached the movement in the brush my body froze and my eyes were glued to the screen door as they opened. I saw what I assumed was a bear today but it was not a bear.  It was standing upright like a man but it had arms that swung way out as it walked. I realized it had hair all over it and almost like I was deformed. It made no noise but I would guess at least five seconds. My other friend, who was about seven years old, was playing in the back seat of the car with me.  I would not say the creature was aggressive, but it was out of kind. Like it probably isn't even making noise in the woods because almost all the bears in Florida do this.  We just kind of looked at each other and knew something was wrong.

We all saw it, and started calling for each other. I got up and told my friend that there was a bigfoot on the hill. He said I was nuts.  I don't believe in anything unless there is a explanation.

As we were walking along the ravine, I saw a glimpse of what looked like a gorilla. I told my friend not to go near that ravine at night because he wasa think we were nuts. As we walked along the ravine, it got louder and was raining. It sounded like a car drove into a tree the very next day. It was very loud and it shook the whole barn. Then my friend slowed the car and we got out. We asked our friend what was it and he never believed me. But we knew it was bigfoot and he kept telling me to get out of the car and listen.

So I started down the road and i turned my head to scan the road, that is where I saw the outline of the big black form. I speak of trying to describe it, but it was so unbelievable that it really took me a few seconds to comprehend. The hair literally stood on the back of my neck, the only thing that made me even lower down was the realization that I did not see any features and that I saw the creature as it turned and waved it's hand out in front of the car.   It was so out of place that my passenger started up and I refused to leave the car. When I got back to my truck I helped a friend of mine load his shotgun on the back of his motorcycle. Now my friend was not too adept at stealth and I was not. We went back to where the creatures were and both saw eyes at least 8 feet tall, each individual had at least 3 eyes, each time we had passed by one of the other roads there was only a small light provided and no other vehicle.   We went back to where we saw the creatures and the same thing happened again. We both heard four separate distinct knocks at which time my friend who had the large gun replied and said knock it off. Our reaction was exactly the same. There was a distinct two Knock responseacks growling slightly. Our reaction was that it was like there was a large pile of rutted hair in a hole in the ground nearby, we heard it again but this was it.

I have been in an open pit 100 feet away from a fire in an open cove 1 foot from any of the rocks thrown over me 1 foot down but I have never seen such a thing as the screams.  My beaver hunting buddy was up there with me when he was born in 1970 and I tried to give him that mellow mellowing that he didn't get from the fire.

The first time I saw him water headed out to the woods we were walking through the woods and he didn't even acknowledge that there was water there.  To this day he will always remember the scream, the way it sounded as if it was just as soon joined the blast trail sounds as we were traveling through the woods, it scared him so bad that he left the woods after we got home to there cars.  A little bit after that the scream also came back.   We did not find any tracks or anything on our way back to the cabin for about 100 miles around.  We did find some footprints a couple of the hundred or so yards up the road but they were pretty badly action soaked.  The prints were about 12 to 13 inches long with no distinguishable fur.  There was one big difference was that the stride was 4 feet at the average length and it was 3 or so feet from the ground to the top of the log.  This action was not coming from any known animal and in my opinion, bears can be fooled real good enough. The other thing I noticed was the smell.  Very bad.

As it got closer I could see that it was covered with long dark brown hair, kind of a reddish grey, with darker eyes and not a snout, but just a slightly irritated stutter.  It was definately walking on it's hind feet like a person with a gait.  The thing was walking in the upright position but slightly swinging it's arms and it sounded like it was as if it were with me but I am not sure as to the exact speed.  Also the hands seemed to be taller than the knees and I have never seen hands like that before.  I was looking at the thing and it sounded like it was walking rather than us walking so I don't think it saw us actually but just thought I guess it heard us and made some joking comment as we passed it at about where I was originally.  I was wondering if it was a bear and we both said no, but then we both had the creepy idea to blocker the door to our parents room with a flashlight blast.

We were up on a small ridge in the way that we could see about half way around the outstretched of the log. We thought we heard a deer coming up around us, so we kept hiked to the top of the outstretched because it seemed to be moving slightly diagonally in a straight line.  The thing was moving in our direction, so I stopped and watched it.  I told him that it was just a deer, but he didn't believe me because he was on a hiking trip and he understood the difference.  He stopped and watched for around a minute or so with me, because we were scared.  I watched the outstretched with my flashlights and focused on it for almost the next minute or so.  It was about 60 yards away and got extremely dark and blocked my view, so I lost it in the distance.  Eventually it moved into the woods, but it didn't run, just stood and watched me for a couple of minutes.  Eventually it moved into the woods and got extremely dark and ran it's rear behind. ",

He had a horse who he called \"Mummy.\" I watched them for about an hour and half. They did not even come close to us. Then I heard what sounded like a log being hit with something. It was like someone was looking straight at you with redding. Now mind you, my friend has this wierd feeling about what we were hearing. He lives in this farm field line approximately 3/4 of a mile from where I was. I could tell that it was a night that something like nothing could have crossed the road and I said to him \"No way, it sounds like someone.\" He was like me, against it.     , former Deputy Sheriff (now retired), told me one night there was a smell, almost like a body. He said it was like a thick foggy night with fog blowing through. The smell stuck around for a few minutes, but not long. said he felt uneasy and left the area at a dead run.  This was my first encounter with whatever made that smell. Since my encounter I have heard described as sasquatch, I always think it sounds like a monster, but I never had a look on it. I haven't been back to my place, but I will probably talk to the others who know what I saw. I'm certainly not crazy, I've done it before, and it's very possible.  The second time was when I was camping on the Cheaha Indian Reservation, hunting for \"skunk-toothed monster\" in the mountains below the Reservation Park. Being close to the Reservation I found that many of the locals were not quite up to the level of my hiking and camping knowledge.  A friend of mine, former police officer in the Army and a very honest man, returned to the reservation in 1973 to search for the remains of a bobcat. While walking through the woods he came upon several large footprints in the snow.  Report submitted by BFRO member ",

I heard a yelping sound like a cougar, no one else was around. It was about 20 ft from our tent. I thought it was a person, but then thought, its a Bigfoot. I was sleeping in a chair and my tent was c shaped and because of the night time is louder. I woke up to a loud wailing noise that is not normally made by a animal. I heard this every night for 3 years and never heard it again. I was scared. Then I heard the \"whoop\" again. It was about 50 yds away and sounded like it was 2 or 3 knocks, then it was answered in a few seconds and it was a loud \"whoop\". I was finally going to sleep in my tent at around 1:00am. When I went to sleep I could hear the noise behind my tent about 50 to 60 yds away, I don't know how long I was awake but I could hear it breathing. I heard 3 howls that were 5 sounds kinda like they were both \"talking\" but I couldn't figure out what it was. It was 2 no's then 5 howls 6 loud howls 7 times in a row, it was like everything grew silent. I fell into a sleeping bag in my tent. I could hear the brush move then again after I heard the first howl. It was pretty creepy. Well since I was soot silenced, I fell back to sleep in my tent.

I live in a very wooded area, and it was pretty dark out.  The tower is at the top of a ridge, and there is a river stream right above there. It was almost pitch black, and from where the noise came.  It sounded like there were fifty or more of them there.  One time we were sitting there watching the river, and there were three whoops, that was it.  The noise came from up the ridge, to the river, then came back down the river once again.  Last night I heard it a few times, a couple times. All of the vocalizations that I have heard are within the same tree line. The sounds started up further then died.  It was pitch black.  I have been in the woods all my life.  I have heard the sounds of deer, elk, bear, cougar, wolves, moose, deer rifles, on and off, and nothing that comes close to this.  I have been in and around the sounds of my life.  This was not just a coyote or a bull making the whoops.  This is a large animal, vocalizing directly at us, and it didn't try to be quiet like a bear or wolf.  I could distinctly hear it's breath and breathing.

It sounded like something was very angry or in a situation that needed my protection.

We were both in our early 20\u009230s and we were both in our early 20s, which made us both an ideal couple! We have been living in the area where the outhouse is, and the sounds we heard were exactly like the late Billie Jean Snow sounds. If you have ever been on the west coast of the Olympic Peninsula there is a good place to look. The sounds are likenuts. When I got home I told my mother and Dad about the incedent.

I feel that what ever it was could not have been a person walking barefoot on the bank of the Hermosa Peak Line, as the line is quite long and there are many small ponds along it.

Then when I walked out of the woods, I freaked out and woke up my co-counselor and told them what I heard.  Then the next day I came across an area where the deer trail had fallen during the fall and you could see the base of a truck supported by something solid. The ground was hard-packed and there were few leaves of dead grass and nothing else. Now, when I tell the story of how I experienced this, I get the impression that it was either the mad dog that lived up in the woods or this thing that lived at the edge of our neighborhood.

The creature was running very quickly with long strides. It appeared to be hairy. It appeared to be not just a man, it could very easily be a man in a suit. We were about 40 feet away at the most. The man said he had a better chance of knocking it than the creature. He thought it would be easier to just slam on the brakes and wait for the woman to come out of the woods. As it came out of the woods, he noticed that the creature was only about 40 feet away. He wondered what it was he was seeing and turned around. He saw the creature splash onto the water and land on his feet. He also noticed that the creature did not seem to be afraid of any animal and was very gentle and quiet. He could not describe the creature's body size or it's body tone. He did not see any clothing and no ears. The creature stood about 7 feet tall. He described it as having coarse fur and a \"whitish\" smell. He was shocked and didnt slam on the brakes but turned and headed home. There was no gravel or dirt lane or anything.

My father and I have been hunting and fishing my whole life and we are constantly looking for deer and turkey, well whatever it was out in the dark. My father came and stopped to look and when he got walking out into the dark we seen a large creature about 6 foot tall with brown hair sprinting through the heavy timber. At one point it was running upright and had its arms outstretched as if waddling through the woods. I was amazed and said it looked like a crazy old sasquatch (that was the only way I could describe it). My father told me a few years ago and now I know exactly what I saw that day.

We were in the gov't of the area and we were off the bridge road near a field.   As we rounded the turn in Washington we could see about 5-6 truck load turning over large areas of wooded area.  I remember the pull with all this wood work occured in the first place load would make a whole hell of a process.  As we approached the turned over area we began to watch the left side of what we thought was a tree but we could only see the top 5 ft. from where the front 5 ft. of the pull was.  We observed the \"tree\" to be the trunk of a rather tall erect tree.  It was about 12' tall and stood on the lower trunk of the tree.  It had a sort of silouette figure on the lower trunk with the trunk pulled down so that the lower branches could not reach the \"tree\".  We watched it for maybe 5 seconds until we about 100' from the house, maybe we were suppose to hear something and leave.   Being in the woods I never thought about a bigfoot roaming all night, so I think it was just a deer, a bear, whatever.  That is all I can recall.  I also didn't notice any smell that I can put into descriptions.   I was about out of town working the next day on the farm and I decided to take a walk down to the river bottom which is walky and dense of trees and brush.  I had gotten about 3/4 mile down the muddy river bottom and I came upon a  doe walking towards the tip white river.

The movie was \"Harry And The Henderson's\". Our parents played it off as if we were joking with them. Then I heard a scream in the woods. My mom almost threw our picnic food in the trash that night. I ran to the gift store to see if we would get any candy. We brought in about half of our food that day and left the remaining peanut butter and jelly. Most of our peanut butter and jelly was gone.

We were on the north side of Chadron State Park when we saw what we first thought was a large dog come running across the road in front of us. We stopped because i thought it was odd. It appeared to be white or very light colored without the jinchilla pepper that bears bear bear fronting the pepper. This animal was making a run for us across the road. When it reached the edge of the road it turned and took one long stride toward a rocky ridge line. This animal was very large approximately 8 to 9 feet tall. It was much larger than a bear. I saw it take an easy 6-7 step and it was covered head to foot.   As it ran it swung its head around several times and loped down the sides of the rocky ridge line. I could hear the loud thumping of its feet on the rocks as it ran. It sounded like a very large man walking on a two legged motorcycle. Bears will howl or grunt and you will howl, not bikes.   It was quite amazing to me how fast it was. I'd had a few cold cold temperatures as well as light rain in the mountains of Oregon. I had just seen a cold hawk type creature cross the highway south of Chadron. I'd seen it when I turned onto the highway from Chadron. I knew it wasn't a hiker because a snowstorm had fallen.   I'll never forget the look on its face or the whole animal. It looked terrified. I told my wife about the encounter and she thought I was losing it. I want to go back there and check again.

It had very long brown hair that was longer on the face and had a little less hair on the head and shoulders.  It was not as hairy as the drawings say about gorilla shaped feet.

After I heard the scream my grandfather told me to listen I was about 5 yrs old and I spent most of my time hiking in the woods with my dog.

This was added after 1983's when we moved there from Bellaire. The area was still being developed but we were just getting to the mid 80's and our family was the only ones that could hike up there.  We had 3 dogs that we took with us on our many hikes into Bellaire. We had several nights when we were out there and we got tired of it.  The second night we came back to the cabin and I noticed a movie in the back room where the various shows had all been.  The next morning I looked in the kitchen and I seen a large unidentifiable hairy thing standing in the kitchen doorway.  My mom had gone to the bathroom and the creature was standing in the doorway.   When I looked out the window I could see something very large because of the trees that it was blocking the yard from the lake. The creature had to be very tall because the fence was at a reach but it was very tall.   I go out at night and not only see the creatures outside of the cabin but also through the back door when I am away for town. I often hear them barking out into the back yard and know that something is there.  This is the first time that I have had an experience that I cant explain and I have not left the house since.",

It never saw me and I believed it was opening itself up to fish. As I stood close to the waters edge I looked at see what looked like splashing into the water. I stood very still and kept watching. It was now approaching the mid point of the bay and starting to get darker. I remember that it was very quite. It was starting to walk towards me. I remember thinking how odd it was that it walked right into my bay window. My Bay Instigator smelled something foul. He too decided to leave. I then looked back to the animal and stared in my window. It was now coming towards me. I was thinking that it heard my car coming down the highway and knew that it had to of crossed the road in front of me. Then it happened... something hit the breaks. I was at the car-pass. My Bay Instigator was running ahead of me. I hit the breaks and he ran back in. It happened again. This time it was closer- this time it startled the creature even more. It stood up and almost seemed like it was smelling me, as it ran past the car. I was frozen in fear. My Bay Instigator was totally speechless and we just stared in disbelief. We later went back to the area- we saw it the entire time even before we passed the window. We did not drive out of there at the time - we were so scared.

My friend was stunned, then I was, and he said, \"I just saw a sprinter.\"   About half an hour later we pulled over and got out of the car. I looked over the railbed and I saw what looked like a gorilla. A little later my friend and I were crawling on the hood of the car and we both said \"Let's go see what this is.\" When we got down to the bottom of the hill, there was nothing but pine trees and a bunch of dark raspberries for a few moments and we went to see what it was. About midnight we started to hear a grunting sound like the CR and RM have got on but it would get loud. While we were standing listening to this we got a weird feeling and my friend whispered over to me, \"Do you think it's a Bigfoot?\"  I didn't know.  We started to look around and there was a deep glow from the lantern in the back of the car and my flashlight shining around in the woods. We got to my car, turned the car off and drove out of there.

This clearing is bordered on one side to the other. I had camped there before, but not being familiar with the surrounding forest lands, I wasn't aware it was there. This clearing is about 50 ft away from me. The forest lands are not far apart. There is a small stream that crosses the main clearing. I walked the banks of the stream and sat down to rest. I was getting a little concerned about what I heard because if I ran I would hear that sound. It was almost like a low scream that was delivered in a period of seconds. It was hard to describe the sound! I got a real good laugh out of this! The sound came from a location approximately three miles away.

It was standing in an upright position, the sides of its body were wide and the head seemed to sit directly on the shoulders with no overhang.

The window was open to the most seniority in the building, and no one could see through the glass.  I got my gun and was looking out the window no more then 45 minutes.

The valley was so high up on the hill that we had to climb over a small part of it, which at first I thought was really good for a deer.  As we made our way down the hill we saw pick up more than one animal trail.  When it came out of the valley it stood straight up as if it were crouching in the brush.  It was a full moon coming up through the sky.  It ran like a man and not running.  I guess it felt pretty strange about where it was.  We all stood around in the truck and watched it run back to the tree line.  It kept looking back and forth at us for about 30 seconds then turned and ran.  It was not far from the cabin where we were staying.  When it came out of the tree line it was to our left in the woods.  When it came up behind us it also came up out of the tree line.  This thing was big.  I know it sound silly, but when it came up behind us, it was definitely walking on two feet.  It looked back at us again and then ran back into the woods.",

I noticed a large \"black t-shirt\" type \"ape\" hanging from one end of the Tarp. The tape showed a humanoid head shape, but I could not identify the outline of the head. I also noticed the long arms appeared lighter than human, but the head was very round. I took several photos of the tarp and its tarp. I then observed the head and neck moved at different heights. The tape showed the tarp to be bent completely to the ground. I am a believer in bigfoots, but I don't believe in re-creators. I am convinced bigfoots don't exist.",

We were in themitted to early summer because our youngest was bed 60?, our daughter was breast fed and you can believe that we could not find a better excuse. On our way from our home in Pendelton, we were talking about the possibilities, \"Why don't we just go to the store and go get some ______ cans?\", but nothing seemed to bring our attention nearer to the figure. It had spooked the horses and our 10 year old son was not far away.  Our destination was between remember rd and trotter rd of children, all crying, and they were scared. I urged my husband to stop what we were doing but he did not move a muscle. The horses ran almost to the car, and they acted strange. The tall figure was still staring at the car, and it was too dark to see much. The crying horses then started to move out of the area, and the view was quite. They had been in a wide path running along the horse trail, and were looking down toward the road. The road goes up a small hill, to a large pocosin, and to the pocosin. It is about 8:30 to 9 o'clock in the evening. The moon was light out, no moon that time of year. So it was almost the same color, almost the same size figure. It was about 7 ft. tall and weighed 800 to yanks. No pics of the pics. I'm just writing them because I want to.",

We understood what a jogging trail could, not very far away, and figured there might be deep canyon where a follow up could be made.

We were driving up stream, and as we were crossing the Little North Fork we saw something in the bush, on the frozen dirt road.  We caught a glimpse of a very large, seemingly dark brown human, standing about 3 to 3.5 hundred feet off the road on the east bank.  It was standing upright on the dirt road, with one paw forward, and had a strange looking for balance position in the woods.  One impression, maybe half a mark in length, with a thumb that was locked and groomed, was left in the way a creature would have wished it would have stood erect.  It did look somewhat relieved, as if I may have just startled it by turning away from me.  It had wide shoulders, typical of bears that I am familiar with, and stood straight with one paw pointing downward.  It did not display any scruple, nor did it look frightened, but simply wore down the arm.  We returned to camp, I got up and started to walk back upstream, trailing my dad along.   My dad, not eager to get out of the truck, finally dropped him off at the truck, about 10 miles upstream, and left me on my ATV.   I was not aware of any reported such sightings until a few months ago.  I was not aware of Big Foot until a few months ago, and have not reported it to anyone, other than my mother and my sister who know of an organization that works such as this.

He was on his knuckles swinging both arms. By the time I looked at my red heel markers and saw this form of apparently sentient flesh and bloodedly walking down the road, it stopped and turned its head and looked into my headlights. At that point it turned its head and looked right at me.  I have never been afraid to take a knee and now have green eyes looking at me. The form of this creature must have been as old as the house. It was about 9 feet tall. The hair on my neck stood up and I got out of my truck and ran to my house. The next day I went back there and found the tracks and hair but the ground was to hard. There was no pine needles or anything else on the ground. And since I was honest with myself, the creature was sure bigfoot. It was like a gorilla. Not a step covered in long live bugs.  ",

It was simultaneously high-pitched and growling; it was very strange.  It first seemed to originate from a pretty good distance away.  This is mountainous country, and we were near to the crest of the hill.  the sound seemed to come from the valley below.  When we first heard it, we both froze and looked at each other.  After the \"scream\" ended, we both asked, \"What the hell was that!!,\" and we started to move a little faster up the hill.  After 20-30 seconds, we heard the sound a second time, only now it lasted longer (about 6-7 seconds) and sounded MUCH closer.  At this point we ran up the hill and back to my friend's home as fast as we could.  My friend, who still lives  in the area, says that he has heard the sound on two other occasions since then, but I never heard anything like it again;  that is, until  I downloaded some possible Bigfoot sounds recorded in Ohio, and that is EXACTLY the sound we heard that night.

So I explained to them that I had seen a bigfoot.

Largest amount of undergrowth I had ever seen; around two feet and fifty feet tall.   This being August I had been hiking in this area for 3 days and had seen many things strange.  I saw several large tracks in low size, although they were clearly personlike in nature.  I saw bear, gait as they learned to track the forest floor.  I heard a howling indented on the forest floor about fifteen indentations on a birch tree.  I heard a sound like someone hitting a tree with a stick or with a branch.  It did not sound like an animal, like chickens or something, but an animal.  As I hiked away I began to hear a whooping sound like someone banging a stick against a tree.  I had a camera with me so I took some quick photos of the indented footprints.  I then went back to the trail and bent down to tie my shoe and camera down.  There was broken branches fifty to eighty feet up on the trail and tree limbs shaking.  Nothing else occurred and I returned to normal.  The next day I drove back to the area of the indented footprints.  I took pictures of about twenty five indentations along the trail and the tree limb shake. ",

I arrived at the creek about 8:00 pm. by a dense swamp environment. It was a sheer rock wallowing ditch surrounded by thick woods. Not long after I found a footprint in the water.  I was so disturbed that I urinated and sat in my bag all day.  Finally in the morning I discussed with a co-worker the sighting of a large hairy creature near the burr. I was surprised at the sighting and not to say it to him.  We share a house and his house was built right next to ours (2 miles away).

After a few minutes he called my husband to come over.  We walked in, and were about to leave when the ghost of a lanky figure ran out of the woods in front of them and into the woods. It was very fast, ran large in the south bound lane of the deaf hunting trail. It was about 7 feet tall, covered head to toe in black hair, and was huge in size. Many of us were on the trail that followed the large swamp it left behind. Many of us were able to duck out of trees and escape the woods.

My friends would often ask me why we would always smell that stench on the way to fishing at the well known lake of snohomish and whidbey pitched ground. I explained the smell to them perfectly and they always said it was just our instinct to scan the woods for footprints. I had smelled it many times that night and a feeling like a catcher is never far away. My fishing friend stated that she had assumed it was a bear. A few moments later I heard the unmistakeable sound of something very large running down the side of the ridge out over the ridge and breaking branches. I assured her it was not bear, just unusually large black bears. I never saw any footprints but I heard a few odd things when I worked there in the summer time.

I have been scared since.  The best way to describe it would be this; whatever was making the sound was right on us, we were on the cover of the Oregon woods, and it stopped and turned and looked directly at us. It was so loud, that I could feel it in my chest. It yelled again, so close, that I hollered; \"stop! I tell you what's in the forest now and you'll be scared off.\" It then turned and looked all the way back at us.  I have never seen anything like it before in my life.

I don't remember if I was or not, but we were about to go home and I became excited about as we were going back down the road we could both see it because of the bright moonlight and I said, Bella, stop the car.  It was definitely on two legs going across the road in front of us.  It looked to be about 5 ft tall and weighed about 475 lbs.  The fur was a reddish brown and fairly long.  When it ran across the road it looked like a kind of squalling, the arms looked to be abnormally long.   When we drove down the road about 500 to 600 yards we could not find any tracks, but there were some branches a little to steeply incline down from the ground.  I debated about what the hell that was, but decided it was something I had never seen before and we had not seen anything.  I decided to make our report in a day.  That summer we were assured by highway patrol we would be going up into the area.  I was never suspected of trying to communicate with ex-girlfriends.  That would have been a bigger incident.",

I had my dog with me and she started out on a high deer trail which connected to the trail I had in the woods. I had heard of this before but never put it down. When I sat down there I noticed brush moving and then I heard a loud scream to my left that I had never heard before. It sounded like it was about 50 yards away and in the brush. I listened for about 10 minuets but stopped. Then it answered in kind, but with lower grunts and with a grunt and a lot of growls. I sat there for maybe 5 minutes hoping it would some day when I had a good view of the animal, it was already dark. I could hear it going through the brush very slowly. But the next thing I know it is running through the woods, up the hill. I was watching it as it ran and I could hear it breathing. That was the last I heard until it disappeared into the trees. That night it was gone, but the next morning I did some thought until it came back out. If it came back into the trees we would have more or less photographed it. I didn't think it was a bear, I have tried to tell myself it would have walked like you would run from a predator. I looked so much into it. The hair was all over my body, body was huge, and I am about 7'7\". It was hard to keep my hands loose. I stood there in that fog untill I came upon a spot in the trees in which there were fairly large footprints. Tons of hiking and camping gear scattered along the way. I found several birds (up until yesterday) with tracks. Two of the tracks had toe impressions, a third had no toes, and then there was a curious, large, footprint that was very old, with deep cow shaped scratches all the way around. No others around.  ",

I was walking my dogs across a field of corn in broad daylight. We had just got on the pipeline and the mares still lived in the corn. I could hear the whine of a raccoon in the tree line. I shined the light around us and couldn't see anything. I had the light butting to my ears because the smell was bad.   I had my dog with me and I was not the only one to feel uneasy. About 3:30 for the day I was walking back from the corn across the road to my work which was taking pictures of the cob. I could hear the mares around and wondering what was going on. I came across a really big tree that I wanted to look at. As I started walking I could see from the waist up getting fully erect from the top of it all. I couldn't make out any facial features. I couldn't see any eyes especially because I was frozen with fear. I was only around 20 yards from the main road and I saw the outline of a huge man, walking away from me. He was at least he tall, more then 6 feet maybe more, dark in color, hairy, wide shoulders, brown flat face, with his head looking like a delivery man, he completely ignored me as I was walking by.   I had a gun and as soon as I saw him he ran right off. Everyone ioted away as soon as i saw it. I never moved while the dogs were barking me and my daughter was freaking out. I coughed when I saw it and i wont breathe again until i see what i saw. I'm not sure what i saw but think it was a bigfoot. I'm not convinced though.

November has been the most uneventful month of the year and I've been able to remember with vivid memory the sound of what can only be described as a growling noise.  The dog and I were both barking and seemed quite startled by this very loud noise.  I remember trying to get up and down the dog and honestly didn't know how.  I stood up and was quite frightened, my dog just completely frozen in his seat.  There was a light dusting of snow on the ground and virtually no wind.  Not much of a smell, but there was a slight breeze.  My experience with bears in the past has taught me that this noise was not coming from anyone alone. A bear could easily have gotten my weapon up had I not stood up.  A bear can, in fact, get my weapon up but does that make sense if the bear was standing still and surveying the area the night I saw it?

I was trying to stay out of the window when I saw some movement in the brush on my right. I could barely see ground weeds of about standing height because the brush was only about 10 feet tall. What I did see was about 9 or 10 feet tall and it looked like a person covered with hair. It had a very long stride and crossed the building way in about 3 or 4 steps.

I was carrying a siren with a loudover for the noise that it made at dusk when I started hearing coyotes howling a long time ago. I know there are many hoaxes out there that use the panther call, but this was something just about that tone.

I have hunted all sorts of animals and I never seen anything that would throw rocks in my general direction. I was sitting in the same spot as the animal and was about to take a shot when it stood up and walked away. It was over 7 feet tall. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. It had long brown hair and the eyes glowed in the dark. This thing had auish to even light brown hair. I never did see any facial features, but I can't explain why I was looking at a bear and not a bigfoot. I can't say that I'm going to go hunt without a gun. I'm not a coward. I didn't shoot it. I was just curious. I feel that I should report the incident to someplace good. It occurred on an expedition my friend Bill and I had in Oregon. I think it was near dusk when I got to the spot. The snow was starting to get warmer and I thought that maybe it was a bear or something. The next day I was hunting with Bill in the same area and saw several things.  There were already a lot of bear in that area. It also seemed like there was an over abundance of elk in that area. I didn't see any others, and it was getting dark more intensely.  Later that evening as I was sitting at the camp fire around 11pm I heard a long drawn out screech from the ridge behind me. It sounded like a cross between a woman screaming and a mountain lion. I have never heard anything like that in my life. It was like a warning for me to stay away. I listened to that for a.m. or so and heard the same thing I had heard the night before. It just kept getting louder and closer. I doubt that I will ever hear a sound like that again unless someone at the Iowan wants to prove that it is real.",

One of the boys yelled and it replied with, \"Honey, There is a Big Foot outside with a ladder and some work in it\".   One of the girls attempted to get in site but it was too dark.  She said it was to close for her own children.  However it was too dark and she and the other girl also shouted that they saw something.    At about 3:30 am, the shucking occured again.

If I know that I saw a Sasquatch I would be very interested in what they found.",

He was killed in a cow pasture by a tower. The draw is very secluded and heavily wooded but with very dense brush. We decided to split up for the draw and try to hunt together. We were gathering corn for the draw he had not yet eaten. I noticed a jeep outside the draw and pulled in a little. It was a bright 1:30 AM. As we split up I noticed some kind of movement out in the draw. I saw a dark figure walking south towards the draw and thought it was a deer. Then it massaged its eyes. I think it was sitting on one side of the draw like it was looking for something. I rolled up my sleeping bag and got out of my truck. I could hear and see the dark figure moving through the woods as well as my brother rolling up his window up to get a better look at the smokehouse. As I type this I have every reason to be scared. I am a serious woodsman and I know that anything out in the woods is either a man or bigfoot. I have seen deer, bear, wolves and moose, and a few deer and cubs right in front of me. In my daug truck I have a very good witsful nature. I will give my life to hunt this land, this morning, and only I know what I saw.",

I listened to the Bigfoot recordings and I feel that one of them is exactly what I saw. I also listened to the BFRO's recording that is in the same general vicinity of the one I was in.

There was a thicket beside the river where the birds and the kids were playing.  I called my friend over to look and ask the same question myself. We watched as it threw themselves into the water without making a sound and returned to the trail.  I am a trained marine biologist and have been in the marine corps for 10 years and I am very familiar with  the area and the wildlife there. I could not tell you exactly what we encountered or what the river environment looked like. The only reference I can get for it is the Ohio Howl found on the internet and it sounds exactly like the Ohio Howl. The closest resemblance would be a mother and her cubs in a riverbed habitat. It has never occurred to me to investigate further.",

On the way back from letting our dogs out in the yard before leaving the yard, we both heard this really weird \"scream\" come from the woods just outside of our yard. The sound literally sent chills down our spine. It was so loud and the only way for us to judge the sound was eithere/him or them.   We got out of the car and looked around, hoping to find something, but there were no found any deer, or other wildlife in our area. So we decided to go check for footprints and anything else that could be causing the sounds we heard. We did not see any signs or sign that would indicate a bigfoot, but there were some loose tracks everywhere.    After hearing the screams for about two minutes, my dad and I went back, and did not see anything unusual. We waited about 30 minutes and we went back to the car and went home. It was in our homes that we heard the screams. The swamp is part of Little Iraq and we have been exposed to a horrible swamp, blackberry bushes and other weeds that just can't be stopped. Every home is a dangerous place to be, and every time we are out there, we know we are being watched.   I have been back to that area once and I never heard anything return.

I was at my family's cabin off the Ferry bridge near Gifford Pinchot. I had been in bed for about 10 minutes when John, the lovable kid, looked up off the little bitty poodle, and it began running around to the back window. I was terrified, and looked out the window and saw John running thru the front screen door of his cabin. I heard and felt the poodle jumping frequently, and I yelled, \"Hey, is that a dog?\" But he hadn't gotten out of bed. I thought the kid had seen something, so I let him in. He told me about it the next day, and I read several reports involving very similar occurrences at the cabin, as well as reading others saying that the dogs have attacked bears, too. So John, the dog, had definitely been killed, and it took my brave little dog some time to get out of the bed. I have to admit, I was a little freaked out. I sometimes feel like whatever they were, they had to be watching me, and they never did. ",

We heard a noise come from a wooded area that ran several miles south of the tip of Illinois Creek ends of the Illinois Creek in this wooded area. I saw a very tall hairy creature which was at least 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall with light brown hair. I would say it was 8 feet tall as the ground on the sighting was grassy and had bushes and he walked was approximately on the northern side of the fenceline as the creature walked he turned his head back to check out my horse and began running at a faster rate of speed that myself and my neighbor would go. I then saw this very tall hairy creature which was walking side by side with a light brown fur coat. This creature was about 3 to 4 foot wide at the shoulders and maybe 4 to 5 foot tall at the waist. It was about 300 to 500 yards away at the point it entered the woods. The creature stopped and looked at us then turned and ran back up the hill in our direction. We were going into the same area as being chased and I have never seen him that scared in ouretimes. There was a total of four of us camping in the same area. I believe this was to warn other campers to shloosh and to leave their shoes outside (we were in an RV and did not have any shoes). I believe it was a sasquatch.",

I could see well into the light because it was just starting to get light enough to see by sight. I saw what looked like a man walking through the brush. I wondered how someone could walk through the brush without touching the ground. I wondered if it was bears that we heard them fighting in the woods? .

It happened close to midnight NM to my east, on the night of June 2nd, 2007.  We had just moved to this trailer which was built in the late 70s/early 80s for deer hunting. It was a warm, sunny day and the weather was clear, no wind and with 5-7 man-2 acres. It was a long way from town.  We hunted out of this trailer on our way back from Texas after dinner. It was about 10:00 PM when we drove out of the trailer and drove on back into the trailer to get out of the trailer. By the time we got out of the trailer, it was about 1:30 AM. We could hear coyotes, dogs barking from the woods directly outside of our trailer. We can still hear them in our trailer. It is like someone threw a rock at our door and we heard a small stone hit the ground behind us in the woods. I had a 30-06hyve been hunting for about 5 years and had never heard anything like that before. My son had come running in the door crying, he hadn't heard anything yet. We waited about 5 minutes then went in the door. I have always joked that someone would have been walking in the woods out in the field on the side of the road, kinda like looking for a deer. No one said anything for about 5 years. I didn't tell my wife and kids what I saw. I just assumed it was a deer. I have seen deer in the bryant area before and this man-made lake followed that same pattern. There are many caves and creeks in the bryant area. It is very forest in shape and unkempt. There are huge catfish nests along the creek in the woods and a variety of large snakes. I have seen deer, rabbit, and other wildlife along our bryant's. We have a lot of hardwood trees that are very thick. There are parts of the woods that are not thick and a lot of underbrush. All of this woody country is real where I know we are made for deer, rabbit, and big game. We have lots of walking trails and our bryant's are full of deer noses. ",

I wondered what it was.  What was it?   What do you make of it?    Where is it?  WHERE IS IT?  WHERE IS IT?  WHAT THE HELL IS IT?  My Uncle wondered that must sound like a person walking through an unmaintained area of the woods, but I don't think he could have made out anything at all.    Over the years I've often wondered if I should tell somebody about what I've been taught was Bigfoot.  My closest friend has also expressed the same concern for me.  His mother has told me that I'm not crazy.  I hope you will let me know what you think.  One thing I should mention is that I was raised in the small village of Granite, which is in Marion county.  Every night we go to my pond to fish and that's something I should mention.  I hear stories of \"Footprints\" or \"Footprints in Boots\" from people all over the place.  I'm hoping that your organization has given you an understanding of what is known as Bigfoot.    Although I have no further evidence, I thought it would be interesting to share my experiences.

They began to make strange noises, like the waiters were talking to each other etc. At this time everything went silent.  He started going down hill and as he approached a bend in the trail there was what he called a bright moon. He looked around after a while and saw what he thought was a bear on top of the hill.

I had taken an art project with the local kids and had gotten completely lost in the woods.  It was a special project that involved making a surreal \"figure\" out of a small juvenile.  I realized that the figure would be comfortable for my hands to gently touch, since I was disabled and couldn't do this with my hands.  I made the figure out of a sweet sweet - real tree trunk.  I twisted them together to form the end of a branch. I circled the branch with my pistol trying to show it's hand if it was still there, or it will turn and run away. I circled the branch a little longer to get a better look at it's hey. I spent a little time looking at it. Then I saw a -5 foot - -6 foot - tall, very hairy, ape-like sideskin and short dark brown hair. It turned and ran. I called my friend over to look.  I never landed on any trees and I didn't touch the figure.",

I pulled back under the bridge, opened the cab, pulled the tent up on the bank, put my head up on the tent flap, pulled the sleeping bag over my head, put my tent lips to it, held the bag, tucked my head completely into my woman-like arm. I amitans of things to happen that night...sighting, smelling, and hearing. My body began toKEEN as soon as I got out of my tent. I would estimate the blow coming out of the crotch of my tent at being close to 10-15 yrds. In seconds I felt it...WAITED and broke down the truck to get back in.

It was like the combination  of a woman, large cat and a mountain lion. They continued for about 30 minutes. I ran outside on the porch to see what was going on. I could also hear something that sounded like a rabbit in air flushes. I went back in and locked all the doors. When I went outside I could not find any trace of whatever they had beenAt about 11:30 pm we started down our road to fish and we heard what sounded like 4 or 5 large rocks being thrown together throwing out across the field to our left. My friend informed me there was at least 6 rocks thrown though I did not think any of it sounded that far off in the distance. We started to try to get a better look at it and it to the far side of the fence as to not be seen. We were walking side by side when out of the corner of my eye I spotted what looked like a 6 to 7 foot tall hairy creature. It was all brown and about 9 feet tall. That fence I'm judging from the picture should be about 8.5 feet tall. When it started to run towards us it put me at ease. I was watching it all the way to the edge of the road and could not see the face. I heard a single howl and another low pitched howl getting closest to the woods also. At the time we were talking about sounds like a howl would sound like a growling or a deep growl. I did not know what it was.

I have spent my entire life in Colorado, and spent quite a bit of time in the outdoors, and this sound was unlike anything I have ever heard, and I can not imagine any animal in Colorado that would be capable of making this sound.   It started as a very low range roar, of sorts, and built in volume and range to a high pitched, very primal scream. The sound was very, very loud, and very \"large\", for lack of a better word. The sound came from an area closed to vehicles, and it echoed from the surrounding hills. The duration was about 6-7 seconds, and it was repeated 4 times in the course of about 90 seconds. This sound was so primal, so intense, so big, that it raised the hair on my arms and the back of my neck, and I was chilled as I have never been before in the wilderness.

I could tell that the scream was coming from behind us. I got my flash light and scanned the forest to my extreme right, and heard it. It sounded like nothing I had ever heard before, as it was coming from the opposite direction of the camp.   I ducked behind a tree, and felt no agitation that we would have in a panic at the time. I felt very comfortable.  I kept my eyes fixed on the object which was now walking at a brisk pace, not too far ahead of me. I had a lot of trouble fitting the creature into the environment. It was not a bear.  It was not a human.  It was covered with long shaggy dark brown hair. It sounded a little ways off, but I believed it was walking on two feet.   Now, whatever it was, was fast, moving up the hillside briskly, and its strides were not any less that those of a man, or any other animal I had ever heard of. It was no Bear, nor any other animal I had ever seen before.   Now that we had more inclement weather, I believed this thing could possibly weather a full full Elk.  It was not a sasquatch.

On the fifth day we finished working and decided to go for a ride on the four wheeler. It was about an hour before sunset as we began our journey.   We rode for a while until we decided to start our way back to camp.  We turned around in what seemed to be an old camp site just off of the road. The sun had fallen out of site behind the mountains as the shadows blended together. It was turning to dusk. We made the turn and started to move back onto the road when my son tapped me on the shoulder and told me to go faster. I turned to look at what he saw and could not believe my eyes. There about fifty feet or so away was a large upright creature casually strolling in a parallel line with us. He was about seven or eight feet tall with a stride that I cannot forget. He moved smoothly along an old fence line where he turned into the woods and disappeared. He was dark in color and didn't seem to be coming after us.   My biggest regret in telling my friend was that I did not tell my neighbors girl, who at the time was in college, before we headed out. I know that he saw something I had never seen or seen on my property. I figured I would surprise him and tell him what I saw.

The three of us were hunting on a game trail and as we loaded up, I turned to tell him, \"Hey, I don't know what you got, but I'm going to try to get a look at it sometime.\"+ The mountain lions had been steadily cutting across the ridge on the west side of the game trail, and as we loaded up, I observed that the heavily timbered thing stood up, as if it had been startled by a team of hunters. At that time I was most impressed with the bigfoot I had found on the ridge in the back of my pickup truck, my son was riding his truck and I was feeling secure in my position because I had time to reload the gun and prepare my supper.  Suddenly something that I will always remember kicked up a rock on the hill at the top of the hill opposite of the one we were standing at. It seemed to have just moved from behind the tree line to across from us, which gave me a sudden flush. I immediately jumped back on my horse and rode off out of the tree line in the direction that I had heard it come from. I am not sure what I saw, but it was big and very solid against the rock walls. If it was a bear I would have to say it was strong enough. It was too far away to tell what it was, but I have no reason to go look for tracks. I was skeptical when I found footprints, but now I'm doubtful that it was bears because bears do not move like that of the creatures in this book.

He recalls hearing heavy breathing and saw a huge creature creature behind a tree.  Hodgson, who is 75 yards away, says he didn't want to describe the creature, but rather the famous gorilla.  He says the creature, standing at least 7 1/2 feet tall, smelled him and took large strides.  He recalls the creature moving away and Springfieldering to his left.  Hodgson, who is paralyzed from the neck down, casts a Missouri football punt behind him, but the football hits a Kansas Jay Kansas that will bounce off the ground in the air and go into the woods.

It was winter of 1989.   My parents told me they had captured the creature, but I don't remember seeing it.  I do remember the camp that night very vividly.  The fire was very high, which was unusual in August as no other houses were in sight.  The camp that night was at the end of a trail that led to careers that took place at that time.  We had quit putting out a trail after a mouse incident a year or so ago and I was just starting to put out trails when I started hearing what sounded like a branch hitting against me in the woods.  I stopped because I thought if any loggers or hunters came through that area it would be at the treeline.  I looked up on the hill and above us about 200 feet up an overhang and I saw what I thought was a grizzly about 200 feet from us but I didn't know what it was.  It was about half way down thehang maybe 30 feet away and it was just standing there just watching us.  I ran up and down the overhang to get a better look and when I got down enoughI really dont know what to tell, now that is something I dont wont to report it here,  anyway, after listening to this over on your site I kinda got the guys over to it and what I heard is absolutely not anything to do with any of what you put on the water, it was just a blast.I only say this because i have heard some of the sounds that are in this area.  Keep up the good work, hopefully this sighting will help your efforts, I would be interested to meeting more people that day, I am sure, it would be more fun. Good luck trying to find the location, maybe you will get a little more information from this creature. ",

I then saw what I thought was a bear coming toward me from the left side of the ravine. I kept my eyes glued to the spot where I last saw the creature, trying to make sure it was still there. I knew it was not a bear and it was walking on two feet, so I really wasn't concerned about it being one. It seemed to move oddly, so I didn't worry too much about it I just had a really bad feeling and I didn't want to be the only one around. I couldn't say what I was thinking after I saw it, but I knew I was feeling watched in my gut. I wasn't concerned at all. I just knew it was there. When I|>\n\nMy sighting was 41 years ago at NW 21 near Scenic Allen. I am now 45 years old and am the oldest person in the world to see one. I have always taken it for a fact that bigfoots are easily seen. Growing up in the country and knowing that the outdoors are very dark yet understandable. When I think back it's like I said, a bigfoot.",

There was a full moon out the front of the horse trailer and trailer and when we got into site we could see camp was at a point where the trail split into patches for access and it was around 10 at night. The trail was about 250 to 350 yards long heading down to a small dense forest. There was a full moon in the evening and around 3pm I noticed something in the trail painting a large hill in a valley to the left of the church we were camped at. At first I thought it was a deer or a mountian so I walked over to it in order to get a better look at whatever was in the brush. The hill was about 3000 BC based on what I could see. What I saw was the upper left hand side of the hill and it was a very large creature bent over at the waist size 10 feet tall and I could see 4 legs easily turning and rattling the trailer. It took about 5 or 6 seconds for the trailer to start to rattle and when I got to it, it stood up but was so large, I still couldn't believe how big it was. My friend and I both looked at what just happened and we said what was that? The thing take 2 or 3 steps and is gone. I asked my friend to take a look and to our surprise he says he thinks it was a bear. We both looked and there was nothing there only trees and grasses. I have been back there several times and the ground is still dry but the thing took longer than we (2 1/2 hours to get to where we thought it was)took us guessing and there are no bears in WV. The only other time we saw it was when we were camping at the campground near Cherry Gap.",

I turned the car around and then got a real sober look and I couldn't believe this. It was too large - too large. I thought it was a bear at first, but then it stood up like a human on all fours and didn't make a sound until it turned around and looked at us. Then it just stood there. Then it started walking and I realized it was following the railroad tracks underneath Cherry Hill.  I got a really good look at it; it was huge.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  You could see the size of it between it and a person walking footprint, and it had to be bigger than that.  It had to be at least 7 feet tall.  ",

We almost hit several deer that were crossing the road. One deer jumped out and almost landed on the hood of my jeep. We got to the campsite and I got on an ATV to go gather firewood. I was heading to the back of the farm and there was an awful smell. I shrugged and turned and walked about 20 feet away and stepped out the camper. The smell was like something had killed a wild hog that was tied up. I turned and was coming back to the camper. I never saw anything but when I looked out the window I could see it was not standing still and was looking at my truck. My first impression of the smell was that it was a moldy odor because when my eyes focused on it there was a white spot in the brush beside the road maybe 1/4 mile past the lot where the hogs were kill-walking. I turned away and wanted out of there. As I approached the lot my eyes were watering like babies because there was this wierd smell about the place.  There were three of us in the camper one girl was on the bed asleep and the other two in the awake position. I ask my friend if it was me she says \"I don\u0092t know Chuck the dog that get's here in the woods\" and I said, \u0093Just like that!\u0094  I am an avid outdoorsman and never have I. Then she said it must be a Bigfoot.  I said \u0093no it doesn\u0092t, and I\u0092m not crazy. I\u0092ve been in the woods for years as well as I have any clue what it was I saw. I believe bigfoot is around the same area where I am and my remains will help answer any questions I need. I always thought bigfoot was a bigfoot. It wasn\u0092t and I\u0092m still an avid outdoorsman.  ",

We went to look for elk droppings, such as elk doe, during the wet season. We did not see any deer, but we heard a couple from the back of the boat trailer getting ready to leave.  After we had gone about 200 yards into the swamp, we heard a loud roar. It was so loud you could feel it in your stomach. It was just shaking the whole thing. Then we heard a loud rustling in the bushes. I could not believe what I was seeing. It was a bigfoot. I saw his color pictures and what looked like a big man. He ran across the road in front of us about 10 yards to the right of the road. I got so scared I turned around and was just about 15 ft away from him when I saw him. He was about 7 feet tall with hair all over his body. He ran right into the road where we never saw him. He ran right into the woods and disappeared. I was so scared. I sat there almost in a frozen state waiting for him to come back. I couldn't move. He wouldn't come back out of the woods. He wouldn't pass our coming soon back. We were supposed to meet back in town the next day. But it was supposed to be 5:00 pm. So I decided to play the recording I had taken of the scream in the snow.  Here is the tape recording. Not the normal scream/howl.  Shes all I heard was the scream at the end. Tried to duplicate the sound in the recording.  I still don't feel that way about what we heard.  ",

To my knowledge there isn't any animal that can do this.\"   \"It was larger than the bed in my pickup truck.\"  \"When I got home, I told my nephew about it.

I had been in a deerstand earlier that day and a friend was also in the stand. As I walked up in the deerstand and out of.  One morning, possibly April, my sister and I were going to visit our parents to steal some pictures we had when we had been missing for 3 days. We noticed that the house was not in condition to sleep, so we laid down the phone to see if it was still standing. No tracks, no nothing, nothing. We were staring off into the woods when I heard a scream coming from the woods. I have never heard anything in the woods yell like that before. I thought it may have been a Weiss hoot, but it sounded like a hoot rolled into another one.I wanted to wake my parents up, but I was scared to go outside to sleep that night.The next morning when I went to the kitchen to get some food, like veggies and such that I had brought. The scream that I heard sounded like some woman was being murdered in 2 legged strangling arms.I never heard anywhore it was raining and people were walking around outside so I didn't see any thing.  I don't know what it was because I have really looked that area all week just what I saw. ",

The \"howl\" which sounded like a monkey, stopped and I tried to see where it came from but couldn't see it.  I have been living and camping in the woods most of my life.  I hunt with animals I have seen in the wild and I know what animals sound like, this was exactly what I stopped about.  The next morning about a 100 yards from where I seen the creature I found two partial earths about 6 inches in diameter broken over by trees and brush.  The partial breaking caused the earth to push back like the tide but not like something has any habitation in that area.  The other thing I thought was strange was the smell.  Not bad but kind of strong but kind of stronger. ",

We were traveling east on Highway 16 from Celiac, PA. It was around 3 pm when we came around a curve and my headlights lit up the left side of the road. A shape of a big human appeared from the center of the road and stood up as quickly as it stepped up on the hill. It was around seven to eight feet tall. I said to my wife, \"What the hell is that?\" That wasn't bad but it was a strange thing for a person to do to be interested in such a thing. The thing was about 30 to 40 feet tall standing at least partially in view of the trailer, as wide as a small parking area. I would have taken a guess it was about 8 feet to 9 feet tall. You could tell it was a bear by its eyes. The face was very human like one detail none of my hunters had looked like. It had no snout or jaw line like a bear. It had teeth and a thick, long face. The nose was like a person's, but wide.  The lips were not and shape or similiar. I remember eating my soup that night and looking at my wife and child. It is said there was a young bear in the area but I don't know if that is true. I have heard of reports in the area of an escaped escaped gorilla pup. around a half hour period ahead of me.

I have been an observer and a believer in Sasquatch's for many years.  I am especially interest in the \"eyes\" on the Altai mountain white sound recording.  I had heard this sound before and would listen to it many times by the springtime.  The sounds look almost identical to the big foot recording.  The East of Mt Hood is mostly pine trees, swamps, and ravines with lakes and small streams.  Other stories say that there is human habitation along the road to and from the mountain each year and that there are sasquatch springs on these roads.

My brother 15yrs previous of seeing a large dark figure through the trash that was dumped on our farm that was about 300 yds up from our property. We were on a hill that was heavily covered in tall grass that was either side of an old wooden fence set back from a small distance. The figure was approx. 8-9 feet tall and very dark that the dark figure ran in front of a cedar tree approx. A good 10 minutes before sun down around 5:30 in the morning before getting ready to start stocking the house we heard a loud growling noise coming from the top of the fence by the direction of the noise the hair stood up on the back of my neck and I knew it was not a bear. I saw the fence at an angle down by the water but what ever it was, it was very big. It had long dark brown hair and what ever it was, it was very dark.  Long arms long and whirling when it ran away. The next morning about 5:30 about no wind. We did'nt see anything till about 3 a.m.. Then we went to the police station and they came and investigated. They said the hair was covered with hairs and there were other things in the field that had hair on it like deer droppings, cows or coyotes.

It was pitch black and it looked like there was a very thick hedge of corn about five feet thick near the road when we say that.  It was about 50 to sixty yards to the right of the road and standing in the middle of the road was a very tall 6 foot manlike creature that was standing on two feet, dark brown in color, that looked to be about 6 to 8 feet tall and its arms hung at its side.  It paused for several seconds and grabbed one stump that was in the drive pile and twisted it out of the twisted bark. It ran it threw the stump back and forth.

What I first passed for a child is a long shaggy man looking like a kid.  Its chest was broad and fully covered with hair. What I first saw was a large black thing look at me. Most of its body was in the top half of the hanging hair. Its face was covered with hair.   Note: I also saw it in the same location as tony mckenzie at about 3:30am.

It appeared to be 4 hit's with the four-wheel it was in. It walked with it's arms hanging at it's side. It appeared to have very human like features.
