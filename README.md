# Bigfoot Sightings Generator
The goal of this project is to web scrape bigfoot sightings from https://www.bfro.net/, the bigfoot field researchers organization.

These sightings will be cleaned and used as training data for a RNN which will generate bigfoot sightings, and these will be tweeted out from a twitter bot. 

This project is based off a case study I did during the Galvanize Data Science bootcamp, which involved analyzing some data from this site.
