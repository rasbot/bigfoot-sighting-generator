53057,0,60,1994-1997+,Spring,,WA,Skagit County,"Up the Baker hwy., about 12 miles north from Hwy 20.",Concrete,Mt.Baker Hwy,"These two gentlmen, brothers, recluses age 50's phoned me and explained these events. They own and operate a cattle ranch. They have over 200 acres of interspersed Old growth Douglas Fir and graze. There is virtually no access (by vehicle) to their land, because of swamps, creeks and no roads, except the drive onto the innitial property. I have hunted the area around their place and know it well. Also locals would not venture on their property because of their reclusness and temperment - this is why I rule out fowl play! During the months from MAY thru early JULY they (the brothers) had been experiencing calv's missing from herd.The herd numbers over 200 head I believe and the weight of the calv's that turned up missing from time to time during this 3 month time frame,were 300 - 400 lb. calv's. No blood, no body parts at all were ever found,just missing cattle.The brothers also stated that the cattle would always come running to the brothers when the cattle saw them in the pasture to round them up for the evening feeding, but the brothers had noticed that when the events, early on, started happening the cattle, upon seeing the brothers - at a distance, 100 yards or more would run in panic. Immediatly I could see the ""Possible"" reason why, being that the brothers were bipedal in nature also. After a couple of years, and this occured the same time -may thru july, the third year on e evening on a round up the brothers finally found a calf that had just been killed and left. They determined it must have just happened because it was warm. They also felt that they showed up and probably scared off what ever had done this because, an animal had never been left before! A vet, among other qualified persons had a thoruogh exam of the calf. It was skinned, there were no teeth marks, there were no claw marks. The animal was killed by having it's neck broke. Now this calf was in the 300 - 400 lb. range, I don't know any man thats man enough to take on that feet. The examiner also found a very obviouse and DEEP bruise mark running in a 45 degree anle from spine down along rib cage. The out side lines of bruise were very paralel to each other and 6-8in. apart. Like something had kicied the cow in the ribs or hit it with a post, tree whatever that was 6-8 in. wide. That would take alot of POWER. Besides, the blood bruise extended all the way into the inside of the rib cage. Analysis of the lung indicated some sort of respitry ailment or disease assosiated with cougars or the Feline species. How ever no bite marks or claw marks were found anywhere on the animal. Tracks were also found, 3 sets total. Two were from an adult, one set 17in. the other 15in. The third set was much smaller 10in.  ","Feces was found and sent to a University in Montana, determination was that it was from an un-known source. The brothers had also found heavy bone, 1/4 in. thick in pieces like some bone had been smashed. These bone fragments were found in droppings left and still warm by what ever had done this.",,"There is a ridge along their property-Doc Butte, S.E.from Mt. Baker, there are caves there and these brothers think that that may be a good place for a look in the future.  I have witnessed two bipedal creatues myself in my youth years in early 70's - since then I, on my own, have studied, followed up on sightings and reports and accumulated info on Bigfoot for all most 30 years now. There are people in this area who are aware of my interest and knowledge in this area (bigfoot), and the unique and very out of the ordinary report I'm about to tell is definately one (due to circumstances, events, behavior etc etc,) that is quit different from hundreds of accounts and cases that I have ever found!

We ate a quick dinner, and went to bed, we never walked around or made any noise, so I don't think they evey knew we were there. You couldn't see our truck from the pond. In the middle of the night, The frogs from the pond stopped croking, and this loud whistling and clicking noise started, I asked my Husband what it was, and he said he thought it was a Bigfoot. It went on for about 15 min. Then stopped. The next morning I walk all around the pound, hope to see a foot print but didn't. We then went up the hill to the lake. No other people were aound, and while we were fishing we heard the strangest thing, it sounded like someone picked up a 55 gallon metel drum and threw it on the ground, I went in the direction of the noise, but could see or hear anything, but we had thet feeling of being watched. very creapy. So we left. Keep up the good work, i think they are very interesting, would like to meet one, and give them a bag to carry thing in, I think they would like that.

Getting dark we decided we did not want to meet what ever it was in the dark and crossed the road and got into the truck, we had to drive right by where we had heard the sounds, we never saw any bushs being trashed, only heard them.

You take an immediate right up the hill on a dirt road. Follow that road almost exactly 9 miles up and you will come to a camp area on your left with a fairly large open field. That is where we were camped.,Ronald,FR 4315,"We were having a family reunion and on saturday night everybody was having a good time. When everybody decided to settle down for the night it was about 1-2:00 in the morning. On Sunday morning one of the family members who had slept in a tent said that they had here a growl type high pitch yell they sounded almost man like but with power behind it. Enough power that it seemed to have come off of the mountain side that was behind us.  While talking about it one other family member claimed that they heard it also. They both agreed that it was about 5:00am when the grumble occured.  That following night everybody was cooking dinner on the barbecue's, steak, hamburger,etc. At about 10:00pm we decided to go the the ""frog ponds"" is what we called it. Parts of the creek that cut through land and made little swimming holes. A half hour later and only one frog, we decided to go down stream, cut through camp and go about 50 yards out.   We were all four having a good time laughing and joking around when we came to a little road that seemed to lead to a camp next to ours that was empty. Then this awful smell like human feces, maybe even worse, was in the air. We thought nothing of it and was joking about somebody passing gas. Granted we had two dogs with us, one an 8 yr. old german shepard and a 6 yr. old husky.  We all heard this rustle in the heavily wooded area to our right. Thinking that it was a deer or elk we all got down low and shined our flashlights hoping to catch a glimpse of the animal. Then we heard another rustle, very loud, like it was pushing over trees only coming in our direction. Then two very heavy thuds that were to close to being human like then a deer maybe even a bear was heard, and like cowards, maybe smart ones, we ran back to camp.  All of that happened in a matter of seconds which seemend like minutes. After we calmed ourselves and grabbed a gun, three of us headed back determined to figure out what it was. The fourth was so terrified she was sick to her stomach. We found nothing to be in the area and no other sounds were heard.  Although we didn't realize it at the time there was absolutly no odor in the air surrounding us. And we also realized that the dogs that were with us had no reaction to what happened either. We preceded to go back to camp and tell some of the others. Five more men got there guns and went to look for tracks. Still no odor and nothing was really found in the darkness.  One witnessed a den like area across a marsh type area of the creek. Where it seemed that something had just made itself comfortable for a while to rest.  What ever was out there we felt that it knew we were coming before we even knew what was going on. It seemed like it wasn't even scared or intimidated by us to turn and run away. It did just the oppisite.  The terror we felt was more then anything I've ever felt before. We brought or tents in the middle of camp after deciding not to let the fear make us pack up and leave.",,There were four of us that was actually there when the incident took place. Walking up the road/trail hoping to find some frogs.,"When all of this was done one of the family members, a sherrif, told us that when he was younger he was out hunting with his dad I think. He said that just on top of a ridge he saw something that appeared to be digging. He just curiously kept watching when what ever it was stood straight up two legged, looked at him, turned walked about 10 steps like a human and then ran over the ridge.  Another story followed about my great uncle when he was hunting but I don't recall the details. What he saw scared him to death and he won't talk about it to this day.",It was about 10:30pm. The area was pretty dark and the weather was more warm and humid then normal.,Where we were camped it was pretty open. Right behind us was a creek about 30 feet away. Across the road is a mountain that is pretty heavily wooded along with a mountain that was a good distance away on the other side of the creek. The creek was fairly wide. Some areas deep enough to swim in and others were shallow enough to walk across or just wade in. Huckleberries and some spotted wild raspberries were around the area as well.,30
53059,46,270,1985,Summer,July,WA,Skamania County,I really don't know. My friend used to be the Ranger there many years ago. He drove & I didn't pay any attention to how we got there. Since it's an established campground it shouldn't be hard to locate.,Trout Lake WA,Forest Road 88,"In late June or early July of 1985 I was camping at Cultus Creek Campground in WA with my significant other, my 12 yr. old son, and our Queensland Blue-Heeler ""Panda"". It was our second day there, and we were having a great time because there was no one else in the campground. This campground is on the edge of Indian Heaven, near large huckleberry fields. We had been doing extensive hiking when Panda suddenly appeared to  become ill. She clearly didn't want to continue the hike. The only thing I could think of was that maybe she had ""altitude sickness"", so I told my family that I would take her back to camp so she could rest. The dog stayed glued to my side all the way back to camp, and even after we got there. I noticed ""rustling"" in the brush as we were hiking back down, but gave it no thought as I've done alot of camping and feel quite comfortable in the outdoors. Late that night (actually early the next AM) Panda began barking and yelping and digging frantically at the door to the tent (which was zipped shut). Obviously we all woke up. By that time there was complete silence outside. I said to my friend that I wanted to let her in the tent, but he said ""No, it's probably only a deer."" As soon as I spoke we could hear heavy  ""2-footed"" footsteps running away. Nothing more occurred that night, or the rest of the 2 weeks we camped there. I have always been interested in Bigfoot (for the past 50 yrs), but I never associated this incident with them. Until I began reading reports on the 'net I didn't know this was an area where they had been sighted. I don't recall hearing any screams or banging on trees while we were there. The only odd thing was that the next day we walked all throughout the campground and we were still the only people there! We were located in the last site in the campground, right by the creek. I didn't think of looking for any kind of footprints or anything, so this isn't really much of a ""report"". Just an unusual experience I suppose.","I didn't notice any smell, or anything like that. No noises except the loud running footsteps. I realize this could easily have been a human being, but there was no one else in the campground, and since we were all awake for awhile afterward I think we would have heard a vehicle start up if there was one. But perhaps not. The dog was not afraid of people. And she was NOT friendly to strangers. I can't imagine her being so frightened if it was just a human being in our camp. More likely she would have nailed him!","My son & my friend were there when it occurred. After the sound of the footsteps faded my son called from his tent ""Mom? Is everything OK? What's going on?"" I don't think either of them believes Bigfoot is a real animal, however.","Just what I've read on the internet. My friend says this campground is called ""The Gateway to Indian Heaven.""",The weather was warm & sunny & beautiful. But this occurred during the night & I was in the tent with the door zipped shut. I don't know the phase of the moon at the time.,"We were in the creek bottom, right beside the creek. I can't visualize the trees anymore, but I suppose it was mostly fir. There was heavy brush. We were hiking on the ridge. I think my friend said it was the beginning of (or at least part of) the Pacific Ridge Trail.",Don't know

The prints were 19 inches long and 10 inches wide at the ball of the foot.  Previous to finding the foot prints we had been about a mile further up the mountain at a small pond. The pond is very secluded and one side, the side across from us was steep bank with thickvegetation. While we sat at the edge of the pond we heard loud brush movement followed y a loud crack as from a large limb breaking. We watched the other side of the pond hoping to see what was making so much noise. Our thoughts were a large animal with as much weight as a bear or elk etc. As we sat, from time to time there would be more rustling of brush followed by the loud crack of a limb breaking but whatever was there never showed itself or left. I sat there for 30 - 45 min. My husband growing bored began working his way around the pond. About half way around he began smelling a strong unpleasant odor. We both felt a strong unease. He came back and we left. We didn't put this incident together with finding the prints a very short time later till after researching the prints we had found and reading about other peoples encounters with bigfoot.  After finding the prints, we went to the ranger station in Hoodsport and told the lady there about the prints we had found. She laughed, said (with a wink) that it must have been ""our sasquatch"". We felt a little silly and left.  I continued to talk about what we had found to friend who mostly were disbelieving, but my boss at work said that it was too bad I hadn't made a plaster caste of it. I hadn't thought of that! The next Saturday, Sept.5 we bought a bag of plaster and returned. The prints were still undisturbed so we made a caste and also took pictures of the prints.",already noted above,"It was my husband and myself. We had stopped to take a picture of a mountain Thorson's Peak.

I wanted to make a loop path through the thick vine maple and hazelnut brush on my property, when I suddenly got spooked for no discernable reason. I stopped and looked around, when I was growled at by something that sounded like a dog back in the woods. I had my gun, and thinking it was a coyote, I advanced and heard it running through the woods. Later, I looked around by the front of my woods behind my burnpile, and found odd looking feces. Full of a light colored hair. The next day, I went into my woods again early in the morning, and in the same spot, I heard a loud knocking like someone with at least a six inch rock banging it on a tree just out of sight. Within fifty feet of me. Once again, I looked for it, but found no sign, but for no real reason, I was scared even with a .45 cal handgun in my hand.

We went on past Bumping Lake about 4 or 5 miles towards Deep Creek. It was the last 4-wheel drive trail before Deep Creek. This 4 wheel trail was about a mile long, ending in a swampy area.  ",Cliffdale,FR 162,"While on a family camping trip this summer, my husband, our two teenage boys, and our two Newfoundland dogs headed out towards Naches where my husband often hunts. We don't like ""organized"" camping, so we headed towards Bumping Lake in the Mt Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest. We had got a late start, and arrived at the lake about 8:00 pm. We continued on past the camping area at the dam about 4 or 5 miles towards the ""Deep Creek"" area, hoping for a secluded camping spot by the lake. We turned off on a four-wheel drive trail about a mile from Deep Creek. Found a campsite next to a swamp, and as it was getting late and almost dark, we decided to camp.  After setting up camp, about 10:00 pm, our dogs went absolutely nuts, barking and very excited...a few minutes later, a car arrived looking for a camp site, but turned and left. The dogs definitly heard this car well before we did, and did their job annoucing the presence of this ""intruder.""  We fired up the campfire and ate a late dinner, while getting comfortable with our surroundings. It was a mild night, it had been hot and dry for some time. About midnight our two boys headed off to bed. Our big male Newfoundland was chained to a tree about 5 yards away from the campsite. Our female Newf was at our feet, as usual. It was extremely quite where we were. My husband and I were sitting by the campfire relaxing when, out of the swamp beside us, not more than 100 to 200 feet away came a noise, a screem or a grunt that changed pitch to a screech and then ended in a grunt-huffing sound, lasting a long time. The dogs had not reacted at all until they heard this scream, when they went wild. My husband is a logger and advide hunter-outdoorsman, so I turned to him and asked ""what was that?"" From the look of his eyes and on his face, I knew that he did not know what it was. He has heard the voices of about every animal in the Pacific Northwest at some time in 30 plus years of being in the woods. Our oldest son came out of the tent and asked if ""someone was messing with us."" He thought it sounded very human-like.  Please remember that there was absolutely no noise, ie sticks or brush breaking or moving prior to the scream, and the dogs didn't detect anything around us, and they were extremely on edge in their new surroundings. We got the dogs settled down and began discussing possibilities of what was out there.  All was quite about 15 minutes later, when we heard what sounded like two sticks being hit together about 100 yards north of the original scream. The dogs once again went nuts. About another 15 minutes went by when we heard this same noise of sticks being hit together, this time farther away, about 300 yards north and the dogs once again did their thing. Whatever it was had moved silently through the brush in the swamp, apparently downwind from us as the dogs detected no movement between the noises.   About an hour later we found ourselves in the middle of a dry-lighting storm and heard no more unusal sounds.  The following morning my husband and sons went on a search of the area and found no tracks or broken brush around the swamp. We promptly packed up and moved to Deep Creek! ","Of special interest to us is the noise of the sticks after the scream. It was either two sticks being hit together, or a stick hitting a tree. When we re-inacted the sounds to try and figure it out, the two sticks being hit together was the closest in our estimation.","Myself, My husband, 2 sons and 2 dogs.",,"About midnight, overcast, no moon.

53061,64,391,1999,Spring,,WA,Snohomish County,"Off Pacific Rim Blvd, in Canyon Park.  Walking trail that skirts office buildings along North Creek.  ","Bothell, Canyon Park","Corporate roads, off I405","Hello:  This incident has me curious.  I did not see a Big Foot, but I may have seen evidence of one.  This happened over a year ago, about May of 1999.  It was not until a recent conversation with a person who knows a little about Big Foot traces, that it occurred to me that I might have seen the results of a Big Foot.  I was working up at Canyon Park, in Bothell, WA, a corporate park that is in a region of rapid transition from country to suburban.  There are walking trails around the corporate park, and some are quite wooded.  I would walk one of these trails out for lunch each day; the trail can easily bee seen from the road and office buildings on one side.  A stream runs on the other side.  One afternoon in May 1999, I came across a tree lying directly across the trail.  The diameter of the tree trunk was about 5 inches.  The tree was freshly snapped off and was about 25 feet long (a young tree).  At first I was confused, because it was fresh, not sawed but snapped.  I could not find where the original tree trunk was located.  It took me a couple of minutes to find the trunk.  The tree was snapped off about ten feet up, cleared from the trunk, and laying directly across the trail as to block it.  I was completely dumbfounded as how or who could have climbed up there, snapped it, and done that!  I brought out a friend from work the next day to look at it, and we both were completely perplexed.  It was a calm spring, and there were no winds even close to the strength it would take to snap that tree.  There were no markings on the ground to indicate vehicles or a cherry picker bumping into it; we looked.  Lastly, it did seem to be placed directly on the trail to block it.  We pulled the tree over to unblock the trail. I was telling a friend about it not to long ago, it never occurred to me that it could have something to do with Big Foot.  It would have taken Herculean strength to break that tree, and there seems no logic to doing it around an uninhabited corporate park trail.  I never bothered to look for footprints.  I bet the tree is still lying there.  At least the ten-foot tree trunk would still be there.  Sorry if this report is so cold; had I known what I was looking at, I might have looked for footprints or even perhaps could have checked for hair samples.  What do you think?  Big Foot or just some big animal (Bear) or kids swinging in a tree?  It is a corporate park completely cut off from where kids play, so I doubt that.  Too massive for kids to break as well I think.  Very perplexing and very close to civilization too.  Murray Stockill Mstockill@aol.com ",Just an uneasy feeling that's all.  Like someone knew I walked that trail.  Seemed kind of personal.,"Nothing really to witness, anyone could see the tree.  It might still be there.",No other stories.,"It occured probably at night.  Over a weekend.

53015,69,406,1984,Fall,,WA,Cowlitz County,"Along the Kalama river, a popular steelhead fishing area (at the time, I'm not sure now). Most areas of this river are accessible from Kalama River Road.","Kalama, Washington",Kalama River Road/I-5 (a ways away),"This is a story that I've never put down on paper, although I've told many people about it over  the years. I was young a the time, but I am sure of what I  saw, so I suppose it's time to report it. You'll forgive me if the details are sketchy, it's been about 16 years (I'm 28 now).  I was steelhead fishing with my father on the Kalama river in southwest Washington state. My dad left me at a bend in the river (unfortunately, I was 12, so I don't know exactly where) and went down to fish out of sight from me.   I drift-fished for a while, with no luck. Then I heard an odd ""whack-whack"" sound, and looked upriver. Across the river, about a 50-70 yards away, I saw a large, black, bipedal figure with a fish (maybe a steelhead?) in its hands. I say hands, not claws, because it repeatedly raised the fish overhead and brought it down on a rock, apparently to kill it. It moved its arms like a brachiating ape, overhead and down in a pretty large half-circle.   What struck me most, other than the odd way of killing a fish, was how upright and thin the figure appeared—I'm no naturalist, but I'd seen Grizzly Adams enough (and spent enough time hunting with my dad) to know what a bear looked like, and this was not a bear. I suppose it could have been a swarthy human dressed all in black whacking a fish against a rock, but why?   Being 12, I pretty much froze and watched. I remember thinking I wasn't going to catch any fish if I didn't cast the line again, but I didn't want to attract the attention of whatever it was across the river. It's difficult to reckon time in this instance, but I would guess it was only a couple of minutes before the creature took the fish and walked back up toward the woods.I didn't actually see it go into the woods, because I reeled my line in as soon as it started to move away and was intent on finding my dad. As soon as I got my line in, I ran down around the bend and told my dad what I'd seen. He told me it was probably just another fisherman and to go back and get my fishing pole.  I realize that a 16 year-old report may seem dubious, but I know what I saw wasn't any kind of animal I'd seen before. I was unable to get across the river (my dad couldn't see the logic in it) to look for tracks, to my eternal regret.",,"One witness: me. I was steelhead fishing, with my line out. My dad was around the bend, out of sight.",,The sun was shining clearly. It was early morning.,"A bend in the river. Wish I could be of more help here, but I was only 12.",

Forest, just west of Mazama, WA. We had hiked up to Driveway Butte that day, and had not seen any other people or recent sign of any one.  In addition, we were the only people at the campground.  It was quite cold that night, so I was awake for a good portion of the night.  At around 2 or 3 A.M.  I heard a loud yelling noise coming from the ridge to the north of us. It sounded like a very large man yelling at the top of his lungs. It did not have that voice-like quality of a person though.  Several minutes later, I heard it again. Next morning, my friend who had been sleeping in the back of his pickup mentioned it, and described the incident in almost the exact way I remembered it. He was so startled by the noise, that he pulled his remote car horn beeper out of his pocket, and was ready to blast the horn if anything happened.

It was spotted BEFORE reaching the cabins and after passing some snowmobile turn-offs.,Easton,FR 4828,"Traveling North in a 4x4 truck on road FR 4828 in Easton, WA, me and a friend made a sighting of something that resembled a bigfoot.  We were about 2 miles down the road from the I-90 interchange and came to a point where we could see about 200 yards up the road. Further up we saw what looked like a person walking in the other lane heading towards us, but on the shoulder.  We were traveling at about 40mph and as we got closer to this figure, we soon realized that this thing looked to be all one color (black) and was walking in an odd fashion, like it had a swagger to it.  We almost immediately knew that this thing wasn't a person, but was something else. My friend immediately told me to stop the car, which I eventually did. I watched this thing and could see that it was quite large, or bulky, because the arms and legs looked pretty huge. There was no features I could make out, it was all one color.  My friend told me to back up and was starting to panic a bit. I reluctantly did and about the same time the thing headed off into the woods, but was still near the shoulder of the road. It began moving branches on trees with what appeared to be considerable force. I continued to back up and took one more glance down the road, where I saw that this thing had returned to the shoulder of the road and was walking towards us again.  We then turned around and headed back to I-90 where I dropped my friend off and went back to look again. On the way back to I-90 at least 3 other cars passed us in the other direction, so I didn't have much hope that it would stick around. Sure enough, when I got back there, I saw no sign of it.","There were some people parked, and near their cars, just after exiting I-90.",Two.

53053,105,495,2000,Fall,October,WA,Pierce County,"I was driving west after turning off the Orting-Kapowsin Highway. I sighted the bigfoot about halfway down the lane on the left. At the end of the lane, a left turn onto a gravel road takes one past 3 houses to my friends' gate. The neighbor I spoke with lives in the last house on the right before the gate.","Graham, WA",Orting-Kapowsin Highway,"At about 9pm, on October 7, I was driving down a private lane near the Orting-Kapowsin highway. I was on my way to farm-sit for my friends, who have a large piece of property in woods and pasture. It was full dark, with scattered lights from houses and pole lights in some yards. A 4-foot cyclone fence ran alongside the lane, with open gates at intervals.  I passed a man walking in the same direction on my left, and shortly after passing him, I noticed someone else moving on the other side of the fence, through the yards. I turned my head to get a better look, and saw the figure from the side and behind as it passed me going the opposite direction on my left.    The 'person' was extremely tall and broad. I thought for a minute that it might be a bear, but it was moving completely upright, with the gait of a man. I probably saw it cover about 100 feet very quickly, and it was soon out of my field of vision. The figure was completely uniform in color, with no lines of demarcation that would indicate clothing or skin. Then, with a sense of wonder, I realized that it must have been a Sasquatch. Possibly the line crew working down the street, which had lots of flashing lights going, drove it off its normal path.  I don't know why I didn't stop the car to get a better look, except that I was tired and already late getting there. As I got out to unlock the gate, I had a few seconds of trepidation, but was soon greeted by the three large dogs I had come to tend, so I felt secure. That night, I left all the outdoor lights blazing.  About midnight, I was startled awake, but I don't recall what the sound was. The dogs went crazy, and made so much commotion that I had to let them out. Once outside, they just ran around in circles sniffing. They calmed down right away when I let them back in.  In the morning, I looked to see if there was something in one of the yards that I could have mistaken for the figure I saw, but I could find nothing. I checked again the following night, in case it was a shadow or something, but again, there was nothing there. I don't think that there would be footprints, as the ground is extremely rocky there, and it has rained heavily since then.   The following weekend, leaving early on Sunday morning, I heard a strange scream coming from the woods. I chose to think it was some kind of bird, but it was definitely unusual, and definitely not the peacock which lives in the pasture.    On the 21st , I was locking the gate as I left, and the neighbor came out to talk. I told him my story, and he told me that a week or so earlier, he and his wife had been awakened by a loud scream right outside their bedroom. He felt whatever it was must have been inside his fence, a five-foot solid wood enclosure. They were both frightened by it, and had never heard that sound before or since. He also told me he had heard rumors of a couple other recent sightings in the area, but he didn't elaborate.",,"No witnesses, except the neighbor hearing the scream.

I can't tell you how to get there specifically because my cousin drove and we went through forest roads from Yelm to get there.,Elbe,FS,"My cousin and I had been descending the slope until we were about 1/2 mile from the crest where we had camped along a logging road. We decided to sit and rest for a few minutes with our backs to a large fir tree. We were pointed downhill and there was a good breeze blowing the tree tops together.  We had been sitting for about five minutes when we heard something behind us and to the right at a good distance away (several hundred yards at least). There were limbs snapping and tree tops knocking together and then something we couldn't recognize.  It started as a loud low moan than rose quickly to a high pitched scream that lasted about 15 to 30 seconds in duration. We looked at each other and we were scared and curious. We tried to figure out what it might have been but we figured maybe it was the trees rubbing together or something similar. It certainly didn't sound like any animal we had ever heard or heard of.  We remained sitting there for a few more minutes (2 or 3) when we heard it again. This time it sounded as if it was literally on the other side of the tree from us! It started out as a much louder low moan and rose again to a high pitched scream that lasted at least 15 to 30 seconds. My cousin and I were scared s***less. We were sitting with our rifles loaded and ready to bolt if the creature came into sight or reached around the tree.  Like I said, It was so close sounding we thought it was right behind us. It seemed as if everything became real quiet, and then we heard whatever it was move off away from us, crunching through brush.  We never did see the creature but then we weren't interested either. We high tailed it back up the slope to the loggng road where we met the rest of the hunting party. They had been further away and hadn't heard or seen anything.",Interestingly though within fifteen or twenty minutes of reaching the road we saw seven or eight deer in a herd run up and over the road from the side we had come up and across to the other side looking real scared and not caring what was in the way. They crossed fifty yards from us and as close as 5 yards from one of the other hunters. Within minutes this same group ran back over the road in the other direction only this time into a wide open clearcut next to the timber.,My cousin and myself.,The only other story I am aware of was in the same area a couple of years later when my cousin Ed Taylor and a friend of his were deer hunting along a nearby forest road and heard something crashing along side the road in the brush and later found some footprints in the soft mud.,"10:00am good light, colder and rainy with about 20 mph winds.

One of my routes intersected with the Monte Cristo Trail aprox 2.5 SE of its head at the 080 spur rd. Following the Trail NW, I found evidence of months old Elk droppings, Similurly aged Coyote scat, fresher by weeks cougar piles, and a set of Buck tracks that were leading off ahead of me and had been made no more then the night before. The Trail followed the ridge line, connecting a series of saddles and hilltopets. some times the trail scurted around knobs and ledges. Which made for perfect preditor observation ambushes. Curious to learn more about the nature of the animals in the area and carefull not to be ambushed myself I checked every terrain character independently. I found many cougar prints on the high areas and plenty of scat, some very fresh, along the trail. About a mile from 080 road on slight rise that formed a small grass and moss covered table I left the trail by 10 feet to look over the ledge. There was however a stunted evergreen that blocked the view further NW down the trail so I steped out in front of it. Looking down I saw a Sample of scat I did not recognize. I was shocked at its size and looked closer. It was aprox 10-12 "" long and 1.5"" wide, tubular and colored dark perpal black, close to the color of bear or cougar droppings but the dropping was almost one continuous losenge and not pinched sharply at the end, like cougar or coyote nor piled like a bear paddy. It looked much to me like Human feces if not for the color. It was clumped and broke once in the center and laid in a line. Using a stick I checked its contents, It was preditory with some hair, but also obvious had indication of berry coloring but no seeds, possibly, berry skin. In addition like an animals feces it did not stink. It may possibly be Cougar or bear considering I dont know everything about thier diet, but if it was cougar it was a montrous cat, if it was Bear it was the most uniform bear scatt ive seen and if Human a very strange diet indeed. One of the things that made me look closer is where the feces was left, behind a low tree off the trail from behind a vantage that could observe aproaches both NW and SE down the trail. It is exactly where a human would go in order not to be seen, nor would it be a place were an animal would go. Animals dont leave their path to far to deficate, and Cougars, Coyotes and as far as I know, Bear, dont deficate where they lay in waite, or may lay again. Secondly A Human being would have a  hard time making this size stool. Im not sure this may be helpfull, But there may be  a possibilty this could have been the stool of a large primate like animal.

53059,269,889,1991,Summer,July,WA,Skamania County,"One of the highest camp sites on the north side of Mt Adams, about 100m from the road and next to a small stream that flowed north. This camp site is about a five min walk from where the wilderness zone begins, and is where our truck could be parked.",Mt. Adams Wilderness Area,park access road,"I am reporting this incident from 1991 because I heard of your group on the radio on the way home from work tonight, and you sound credible.  I served as a US Army Infantry Sergeant at Ft.Lewis Wa. for several years, I am also an alpine climber. I went to Mt Adams most of the time because it was much more private than other mountains ie: St Helens, Rainer -- to many people. I also loved the thousands of acres of wilderness area which was restricted to six or eight hearts per group and no vehicles.  Another Sergeant named Jim Avila, my climbing partner, and good friend, and his Golden Retriever pup were there also.  We were only camping and hiking around this trip, since we had the puppy with us, normally we would have camped on a snowfield above the tree line.  Just after nightfall we were talking and the puppy was next to the fire. The sky was crystal clear and everything ""felt"" normal. Since I spent six months out of the year living in the woods, and deserts of the western US and Europe, in the Army, the night is my ally--- I am an expert at what normal feels like.  I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire.  We then decided to have some fun and see if we could get a coyote to howl, although we were not sure if any may have been around. We started our best howls to no avail. We continued for about five min. and then stopped. About and hour passed since my previous trip to urinate and I figured I would go again before getting in the sleeping bag.  Jim was across from the fire and could see my walking toward the spot overlooking the path to the creek where I intended to void my bladder, HA HA.   As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20' away. When It heard me stop, it stopped a little to late and I heard it. I felt intelligence in it's movement, not instinct, it knew it had been busted and just froze. I froze and drew my pistol Jim saw this and at the same time said the puppy flew into the cab of the truck.   Jim, also sensing something wrong, drew his pistol, and stood up. I was looking right where this guy was standing but could not see him because he was across the water but still in front of the opposite bank, he was still frozen like a ROCK. Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right.  His look was concern mixed with a child like fear, as if he really wanted to introduce himself in some way to our ""wolf-calling group"", Also puzzled like ""why are you indiots calling coyotes?----Your Humans, Stupid!"". The most animal like trait was a sort of a very brief mock anger face, which looked like an after-thought just before the big guy went into the woods.   I looked at Jim --- no words --- we threw most of our stuff in the truck and left in a big hurry. There was no way I was staying in those woods that night.  The big guy was huge, but slender as I recall. Don't ask me how, but I know he was an adolesent. He was sort of like a big kid, but moved like the wind. He saw my eyes and I saw his. I did not tell Jim what I saw, I never did. I never had to.  Please belive me, I swear this account to be true. Thank You, and God's Speed in your search.

",Leavenworth,Icicle River road ,"After arriving at the lake we set up camp and heard screams a couple times that we thought were mountain lions. An hour or two after we went to bed I was still awake because the rest of the group hadn't made it to the lake and I was worried about them. A wind break of poles about 6' tall was beside us and a head was moving along on the far side of it. I thought it was one of our group. When it got to the far end of the wind break it squated down and began going through my pack. This didn't bother me because I thought that one of our group needed something. I said ""You finally made it."" It stood up and at this point and I realized it was a foot or two higher than the wind break. Between the moon and what was left of the fire I could see what some years later people were calling Bigfoot. It turned and walked away into the night.   Update: December 12, 1999.   Before I start let me say that although my memory is still quite clear there are certain parts that I am not sure of. I am going to try to get in touch with Glen and get his memory of the night and make sure I'm not forgeting or wrong about any of it. Glen was the president and I was the VP of the Edmonds Junior Sportsmen's club. Our group of about 6 kids and one adult left on a Friday to go to Lake Colchuck. The adult fell into the creek at a crossing about two miles in. We had about four miles to go. Glen and I decided to go on ahead and build a fire so the adult could dry off when he got there. It got dark long before we got to the lake. So dark that we couldn't see the lake when we first got there. We lost the trail or actually the trail ended because we were at the lake. We started circling around looking for the trail. One of us would stay put while the other walked around looking. We stayed in touch by yelling back and forth. Glen found a lean to and we set up camp for the night. The moon started showing through the clouds and Glen went looking around. He came back and said we were just past the lake. I took a pan to go get some water from the lake to cook with. When I was dipping water from the lake I heard screams from the other side of the lake. Suddenly the screams were about half way around the lake. I thought a cougar was racing around the lake to attack me. I ran back to camp and grabbed my .22 rifle and waited with Glen for the cougar to show up. It didn't so we decided to scramble eggs since I dropped the water while running back to the lean to. We decided finally that the rest of the group wasn't coming up that night so we went to bed. A hour of two later I was still awake and saw the head moving along the other side of the wind break. At the far end of the windbreak, about 10 or 15 feet from my feet it squatted down and started going through my pack. I thought it was the adult possibly getting some dry clothes. I said ""You finally made it."" The thing stood up and I finally realized it was quite a bit taller that the wind break. I realized it wasn't who I thought it was. It was about 7 1/2 or 8 feet tall and wider than most men. I was scared and confussed. Even though the .22 was right beside me I was too scared to move. After several seconds what ever it was turned and started walking away. I woke Glen up and told him to look. He couldn't see anything at this point but we could both hear it moving through the trees. In the morning after a sleepless night I went to my pack and noticed that it wasn't torn but my stuff was all over the ground. The part of the story that seems to make people not believe me is that the only thing gone was the oreo cookies. The package was there but no cookies. I didn't see the thing eat them but I don't know how else they could have disappeared. When the rest of the group showed up I told them the story and the adult said it had to be a bear. Only it wasn't. Someone made some comment about a big foot but neither I or anyone else believed in that. Later that day we were walking around the lake to where the screams came from the night before. The talis slope was formed by some very large rocks. One large slablike stone formed a sort of cave under it. Inside at the far end was some brush and maybe grass. There was hair on the brush that looked to be black. Everyone decided it was a bear den and that was what I had seen the night before. Some years later while working with my dad in someone's house I noticed a magazine with a kind of siloutte of a sasquatch on the cover. I think it was called ""The year of the Sasquatch"" or something like that. I looked inside on the sightings page and in the Colchuck Lake area there were a bunch of dots. That's when I allowed myself to believe that maybe these things do exist. I also listened to some of the recordings others have made. The high pitched screams very closely resembled the ""cougar"" screams I heard while getting water.  ","Missing food (cookies) package was left behind, rumaged through backpack, possible bear den, animal ""screams"" at first thought to be cougar.","All in bed or asleep, witness was awake, waiting for another memeber to arrive.

",Stevens Pass,FR 6700,"We heard a strange sound the summer of 1975 on the Little Wenatchee River near Rainy Creek. My mother had come to visit and we took her to a replanted clear-cut at the base of Mt. Howard (SE of the bridge that crosses the Little Wenatchee River). The clear-cut was about 300 to 350 yards in diameter. We were going to camp near its base. We also had my mother’s dog ’Lady’ with us and its scent may have brought about the confrontation. We heard a very loud roar coming from the other side of the cut. The creature was hiding in the tall timber out of view. Imagine a very, very deep voiced man making a rough sounding lion roar. Imagine that he has a microphone, amplifier, and good speakers: that is what it sounded like. I thought it might be a black bear and so I fired my 357 revolver into the air 3 times to scare it off (generally I have found that enough to warn off a bear, especially in areas where they are hunted). But I was immediately shocked to find that instead of running the beast roared louder in rage and more rapidly: Raaaa! Raaaaa! Raaaaaaa! My 357 seemed to me to shrink to the size of a BB gun, and we threw everything in the car and left. I have heard lions at the zoo roar, but this was louder and more like something you would hear in a 1950s monster movie. I was young in those days and I didn’t desire to go up an see the beast making that noise, but now that I am older and realize the real destination of life, I wish I had.

They ran from west to east towards the direction we had been coming from. Above the easternmost track there was a 5th print that was the best to view. These two prints had been created by a biped who put most of their weight on the lower down hill leg while placing only a small amount of weight on the uphill leg. As a result, the lower foot had slipped about 8 inches down the slope, tearing the slope to the wet clay beneath. The upper track was 16 inches long and over 4 inches wide. The track that had exposed the wet ground was less than 10 minutes old when we found it, since it dried before our eyes to form a dry crust. My husband, Mark tried to duplicate the track's depth and appearance by stomping his hiking boot into the ground. It required 5 such kicks. The main line of tracks were spaced at over 4 feet apart. When Mark tried to duplicate this same stride length, he fell because the slope was 45 degrees. Above the 5th track, there appeared to be toe-kick-in prints made as the subject turned to go directly up the slope. The tracks vanished in an area covered with deep pine needles. We followed the general direction of the prints uphill until we came to a large nest. The nest was next to a pine on the uphill side. It was about 3 to 3.5 feet high, made of pine needles and was shaped sort of like a volcano with a hole at the top. The hole was about 2 to 3 feet wide. We took pictures of the best track, and the nest. Over a decade later, we were watching a special about China on P.B.S. that showed what was supposed to be a nest of the Chinese version of Bigfoot. It looked just as ours had except the one in China was made of twigs. It appears that the subject was moving our direction, then stopped to view us. It then climbed up the slope towards the nest site for what ever reason.   This occured at 10:00am-11:00am in May of 1977.   ",,Backpacking.

This sound was like nothing we had heard or have yet heard since. Neither of us believed in the Bigfoot at that time. Nevertheless the voice of the creature was so strange to us that we threw all of our camping gear into the car and drove off. The trees in that area are about 200 feet tall and because of the low cloud cover it was a pitch black night, therefore we could see nothing in the tree.

I was sitting outside with my dog watching the embers of our campfire die down. Suddenly a rock seemed to roll down the side of a slight hillside and hit the tent.  I couldn't understand how that could be due to the thick trees and brush that surrounded us. Then it happened again. It was pitch dark on a moonless night near the Elwah River. I quickly woke my wife and the two of us grabbed the kids and got inside our car which was parked less that ten feet from our tent.  My dog jumped up into my arms and began shaking. We sat in the car for about a half an hour. Finally, I decided to get out of the car. I wanted my dog, who could be fairly aggressive at times, to come with me but he refused to budge. He just kept shaking.  I felt compelled to walk a little way from the car. Yet, I also felt foolish to be doing it. Suddenly I seemed to feel the presence of something very tall, something living and man like next to me. We just stood there together for what seemed like a time warp, an unknown moment. I could hear it breathing and could smell an unusual odor that seemed to be surrounding me. It was musky and rather foul.  I thought I was imaging everything and then began to walk toward the car but froze in my footsteps when I heard my unseen companion begin walking away from me. I could slightly feel the vibrations of each footstep it made. The time in between each step seemed slightly longer than the time I would need in walking, especially when it appeared that the being was snapping twigs and limbs as it left our area that sounded as though they were fifty to one hundred feet away in a mere matter of two or three seconds.  I quietly got back into the car. We turned on the headlights but nothing was around. We waited a little more but there was a certain feeling that we had all experienced that seemed to had vanished. It was replaced by a mutual sense of peace and security. The unusual smell had also drifted away. It is hard to explain. Anyway, we went back to the tent and all cuddled up quietly and went to sleep. My dog's fear also vanished at the same time ours did. I suppose it was my dog's attitude that was the deciding factor for our return to the tent.  All went well for the rest of the night. However, we decided to break camp the next day and head somewhere else. There have been reported sighting of the Bigfoot around the Elwah River area from time to time and I am convinced that we were visited by one that night. I am also convinced that I was so close to one that I could have reached out and touched it without any effort at all in that total darkness. ","We looked into the darkness at some kind of whirring green light that seemed to come and go every few minutes. It seemed to appear about fifty feet away from us.

53009,282,930,1984,Summer,July,WA,Clallam County,"Using USGS 7.5 minute topographical map titled: Ozette, Wash. Provisional Edition 1984 (I don't know how to use the Minute/Hour of Lat/Long system so this is an Army style grid coordinate of the incident)   Grid: Aprox. 717351 on the beach across from Ozette Island  ",Clallam Bay,Hoko - Ozette Rd,"I was on a summer school field trip 12 day hike with both teachers and highschool students from my district. A black hairy bipedal creature emerged from the treeline at the stream. The creature was large in mass but I am unsure of height as the creature was partially bent over looking and reaching sporadically into the stream. We shouted to look at the thing to our group. As the group stopped and turned, we ran back maybe 20 feet to rejoin the group. As we all stood there and watched the creature came about half the distance of the stream towards the ocean, still looking and reaching into the water. While this was occuring, somebody started to whine as in fear, and the teachers with us began saying ""Calm down, it's not what you think. Just relax, we know what you're thinking, but trust us it's not. Just calm down."" Nobody up to this point had said the word ""Bigfoot"" yet, but then as I remember someone saw the other group way down the beach, and tried to shout a warning to them. They yelled, ""Look! Bigfoot!!"" At this point, the creature, stood straight up, and looked directly at us for a few quick seconds. I was so scared that I do not remember how tall it was, only that I have the impression of a very tall creature. It then turned to it's left and strode back into the woodline. I do not know how many steps it took, becuase once again I was very frightened. The other group started to run towards us, and our group started to go towards them until our teachers stopped us, and made us wait there. One teacher went to the creek, and met the other teachers that were in the second group there. One of the second group teachers herded the rest of the kids to us, where we were all now very excited and wanted to go check the scene out. There were either 3 or 4 teachers now conferring at the scene, with 2 waiting with us. When the other teachers came back, they said that what we saw was not Bigfoot, but just a black man, who was camping in the treeline. They said that he was naked, and that's why he was all black. I remember someone asking if they had talked to this man, and we were all told to ignore it, forget about it, and just plain drop the subject. All the teachers then started to really sell the ""black man"" story, but we were not allowed to go and see him for ourselves. Only a few of us kids believed this at all, and this was the start of a few other incidents that happened to us along the way. ","Every day from that time thereafter we all felt like we were being shadowed. Any time we were in a cliff or steep slope area rocks would always fall either in front of the group or behind the group. In these areas there was always tree cover on top of the cliff or slope, and nobody ever mentioned seeing anything.   We made another day trip to Allens Bay at the South-West portion of Lake Ozette to bathe after spending the day before repairing some benches and I beleive a latrine at the Norwegian Memorial. During our hike to Allens Bay, we all heard occasional heavy crahsing in the woods. Sometimes it would be heard in front of the group, and sometimes behind. Sometimes to the left of the trail, and sometimes to the right. Sometimes near, and sometimes far. The crashes would sound like a piece of heavy debris of some sort, falling through heavy undergrowth. They were never heard right after the other, and the duration between crashes was always different. When we got to Allens Bay, we all went swimming for a bit, and washed in the lake. We never heard anything while we were there, but we heard a few more crashes on our way back to the beach, though not as many as on the trip to the lake. The teachers kept telling us that it was just dead timber falling which it could have been, but it would be very coincidental that that much timber fell along our path to the lake and back.   We kept having the rock incidents every day we hiked, and once I remember we all encountered a horrendus smell just before we crossed a wooden footbrige over a large stream. Looking at the maps, I aproximate it as being on the USGS 7.5 Minute Allens Bay Washington Map, Provisional Edition 1984 at: 748178 2 Grids South of the Starbuck Mine site. We saw nothing, and heard nothing though. I remember the smell being extremely repulsive, but not like a skunk, rotten egg, nor dead anything. I can't describe it accurately except for it being extremely pwerful, extremely awful, and slightly ammonia-ish.   We met up with our twin group that was hiking North from the Hoh Indian Reservation at La Push, where we were re-supplied. So this would be day 6 or 7. They were all enthralled by our stories, but said nothing had happened on their trip so far. We stayed the night down on the beach just South of La Push. I remember a huge gale hitting us that night, which may help pinpoint the time. After La Push, we only occasionally saw falling rock, and lost the feeling of being followed, so I don't know if it was because of the town, or the storm. The rock falls after La Push were also all smaller, and could have been natural. (as could all of them, but I don't beleive the others were natural.)   I don't remember the other group saying anything about any incidents on their way North from La Push, but I remember all of us being kidded about it after Summer School, and I don't like to discuss it much as it is a subject of much ridicule. I've tried to report it several times, but have backed away each time. This time I decided to actually report it, as I'm tired of hiding it away.   The school district that this summer school ""Ocean Trek"" was through, was Shoreline School District #412.The only teacher's name I remember is a Mr. Benson, and I remember his son Boyd being there, but these are the only names I remember with any certainty.  The second group of kids all complained of a slight stench in the area of the stream, but none of our group smelled anything.  ","We were split up into 2 groups and coming back to our initial camp from a day trip to Cape Alava where we were doing a biological exploration of the tide pools and area. I was in the lead group of about half the kids, with I think 2 of the teachers. The second group was aprox. 1/2 to 1 mile behind us. I can't reacall the distance of them well. Our group crossed a small stream that came out of the treeline about 50 to 75 meters from the waterline. I remember the stream being too big to jump across, but not very deep. Only to just below the tops of my Raichle hiking boots. After we had waded the stream and walked/ran about another 300 meters down the beach, we were told to wait by one of the teachers. I remember stopping, and turning around to wait for the rest of my group with a couple more kids. As we were waiting and watching.  As memory serves, it was 5 or 6 teachers and about 20 or 30 teenagers. ",,,"Coarse beach, with sporadic driftwood accumulations. Heavy pine forrest to the East. Ocean to the West.

53011,283,933,1989,Summer,June,WA,Clark County,"Just South of the small community of Yacolt, Washington. Yacolt lies 21 miles NE of Vancouver, WA, 26 miles SW of Mt. St. Helens, 7 Miles S of Lake Merwin and the Yale Reservoir. ",Yacolt,Garner Rd,"Mrs. Brenda G., washing the dinner dishes, looking out over her backyard, past the horse corral with its pony and off into the distance, notices that suddenly the horse becomes unruly and seems close to panic, while an indistinct figure passes through the trees behind the corral. She calls to Nick: ""Nick, there are some kids out there trying to tease the horse"" and steps out the kitchen back door with a BB-gun in her hands for good measure. Nick races out past her and some distance down the overgrown meadow along the stand of trees, where he comes abruptly face to face with a sasquatch standing on the indistinct foot path. Nick comes to such a ""screeching halt"" that he slides on moist vegetation and sits down on the ground. For reassurance he throws a backward look to his mother who, however, has returned to the house. When he looks back at the sasquatch, it is already walking with long strides across the brush and wildflower covered meadow, ""lifting up his feet more than people do"". As Nick scrambles to get up, a branch snaps and the sasquatch turns to look at him ""with big eyes"".   Nick runs back into the house, tearing the screen door off its hinges in the process, to tell his mother about the creature and to change into boots from his slippery loafers. Then he charges back out, taking a large army bayonet from over the fireplace for protection, with Brenda close behind. Their two dogs have retreated under the house.   As he runs down through the same meadow, the sasquatch is still walking about there, retreats downhill, crosses a small creek and stops on the far bank of the creek under a fir tree to face his pursuers, his entire body bathed in sunlight and visible from head to toe. Nick stops about 30' away, his mother stands about 15' behind him. This silent tableau holds its place for what seems an extraordinarily long time, perhaps 5 minutes, although Nick's and Brenda's estimates, colored by the adrenaline of the encounter, range as high as 20 minutes. Whatever length of time passes, it gives Nick and Brenda the opportunity for detailed inspection of the sasquatch.   They describe it as being 6'6"" tall (as measured against a branchlet that barely touched the crown of its head), covered with black-gray fur and golden brown patches on its shoulders and chest. The hair is 4""-5"" long and dirty with burrs in it. The head is notable for its pronounced brow ridge and deep set eyes, that are ""less open than human eyes"" [facing into the sun]. It has a wide and stumpy nose, the hairiness under the nose getting thicker, hiding the jaw line. It has impressively wide shoulders (""Man, they were this wide!"", Nick holds his hands far apart in retelling), heavy arms, wide hands with thick fingers and dark brown and rough palms. Its nails have a deep yellow ""nicotine-stained"" color. Its torso narrows somewhat to the waist, no genitals are visible in the fur, and it has ""sort of a small butt for a man"", according to Brenda's astute assessment. Both observers perceive the animal as a male. Neither of them detects any smell.   In due time Brenda gets the ""willies"" and anxiously screams to Nick to break it off. Thereupon the sasquatch screams, takes a step across the creek toward them, while holding its arms out to the side by about 45 degrees, as if to herd them on their way. They run halfway up the hill to the house, when Nick feels compelled to give it one more look. He is rewarded by a repeat of the faintly aggressive display. They continue to the house, Brenda scooping up John from the lawn, who says: ""Mommy, there is a big monkey in our backyard"". Brenda climbs up on the low garage roof and watches the sasquatch walk away. The dogs stay under the house for a safe two hours and will not let themselves be coaxed out, even by having meat waved at them. The horse has substantial abrasions on its fetlocks from having gotten snagged on a rope in its panic.   Brenda phones 911, but hangs up before the call is answered. After some time she phones back and reports the encounter, which is duly noted in the police blotter, but not acted upon. Only an alert reporter from the Vancouver Columbian catches the brief note and looks up the family. This reporter and several Sasquatch investigators canvas the surroundings and neighbors and come up with a few additional items.    Two sets of foot prints are found, 12"" long and 6"" long, whereupon Brenda puts a roast chicken into a high tree fork, since she wants to see the ""baby"". An adjacent unused meadow has a large depressed area of grass in it. A patch of thimbleberries is found on the steep hillside to have been stripped of its fruit and leaves, leaving bare canes behind. The adjacent farmer's cows, which had just been turned loose for the summer into a higher, lush meadow, come rushing back to the barn that night, something the farmer had never observed before. After about a week, little John comments casually: ""The little monkey isn't coming to play anymore"".   ",,"Mrs. Brenda G., a young mother, German, recently moved to Washington from the US South, doing dishes; her 15-and-a-half-year old son Nick, a short but muscular and macho kid, doing homework; her 5 year-old son, John, playing outside on the lawn; two dogs, one pony. The father is at work away from home at the time of the event.","A sasquatch was seen above a nearby lumber mill about 4 years earlier. Nick had been sleeping on the screened porch of the house and had heard noises (rustling brush) and ""slapping"" foot steps on the street during the night. Similar sounds were heard by the overnighting Sasquatch investigators after the sighting. Earlier in the same year, while a Little League baseball game was in progress at the Yacolts ball park, a sasquatch stepped out of the forest in full view of the spectators in the bleachers and briefly viewed the game in progress before retreating into the forest. A neighbor and his daughter saw the Sasquatch on an evening after the G.'s sighting, but refused to talk about it to investigators. A couple of investigators from Seattle arrived and proceeded to establish a camp in the early evening on the steep hillside, where the thimbleberry patch had been found. After several hours, about 11 PM, they came racing down the hillside, dragging their unfolded tent and sleeping bags behind in disarray, got into their VW van and left without further comment, never to be heard from again.","About 8:30 PM, clear sky, sunshine and pleasant temperature.

We were on the east side of the divide heading towards Lost Lake if I recall. It was in June or July of 1985. We had pissed our dads off for some reason and they told us to get out of the back of their truck to walk. As the truck rounded the corner and the dust subsided, it happened. We heard the rustling of trees and shrubs about 10 yards downhill of us. Then the most guttural, loud, and high pitched yell erupted from the trees below. We hunt all of the time and have never heard anything like that. To this day we cannot pin it down to any known animal in this region. It wasn't an elk as it didn't bugle. It wasn't the cry of a mountain lion, and certainly wasn't a bear. The sheer decibel level of the sound indicated to me that it was a rather large animal. We looked at each other and ran to that truck about a mile away. We never looked back, we were too scared. An interesting thing happened about five months ago. I rented a bigfoot documentary which had a recording some campers had made in Washington State somewhere in the summer of 1971. Too my astonishment, the recording was a duplicate of the spine trembling cry that we had heard. My brother and friend couldn't believe it when I called them right away to let them listen.

What I saw was a large black head and shoulders coming over the guardrail on the south side of the road. As I came to a stop, I turned on the highbeams and saw the creature step easily over the guardrail. It was about 8 feet tall with a kind of shiney black hair covering most of its body.  As the creature walked, I noticed it never quite straightened its legs, yet it had a graceful stride. Its arms hung fairly low, coming to just above the knees. It was very powerfully built with massive chest and arms. Even though it was covered with hair, I could see its muscles flexing in its legs and arms.   Most of the hair was an inch or two long with some maybe 4 inches on the back and shoulders. This thing was big. In my estimation it had to have weighed 800 pounds or more.  As it neared the center of the road it actually turned and looked right at us. Doing so required it to turn its upper body as its head sat low between its shoulders. When it looked at us its brow furrowed in what I believe to be a look of anger. It looked really p.o'd. I could see its palms as it swung its arms and noticed it had either no or very little hair in the palm area. Also the ""soles"" of its feet appeared to be devoid of hair. there was almost a hairline at the sides of its feet.  Also noticed was what appeared to be male genitalia , though the genitalia would have to be considered quite small when taking into account the size of the creature. It turned its head back to the forward position and continued across the road and out of my headlights.  On the right (north) side of the road here is basically a shear cliff. It had to have climbed right on up. There was no other place it could have gone. I actually turned my truck in the direction it was moving to see it and could not.

I walked along a somewhat open road and not seeing any birds was on my way back to the camper. About a 100 yards or so from the camper, I heard some very heavy footsteps. Thinking it to be another hunter walking heavily to alert others that might be in the area that he was coming through the cover. I stopped on the road waiting for the person to appear so I could acknowledge his presence, and he, mine. What appeared in an opening was what I thought at first to be a bear. It was standing upright and when it came into view, it spotted me immediately, turned toward me and froze. It stood there for only a few seconds, then suddenly turned to its left and disappeared.

It had come up an old overgrown logging road and the ground was hard packed with tufted grass laying over. I could find no tracks and couldn't even make any myself.

53027,291,946,1995,Summer,July,WA,Grays Harbor County,,Elma,Keys Rd,"The first incident dates back to around the summer of 1995. It has been a while, so I can't be completely sure of the exact dates. One of my older sisters, and her three young duaghters were out looking for a place to pick wild blackberries with my younger sister. There were blackberries in abundance there, which was kind of odd, considering it was so close to the road, and there were many people out picking berries that time of year.  They picked berries for just a few minutes when they began to feel uneasy, like there was someone watching them. The girls started to get scared, and one of them said it was a scary place, which was unusual, since it was a nice summer day, and the spot seemed pleasant enough, down by the river. After a few moments, their uneasiness turned to outright fear, and they decided to waste no time leaving.   My younger sister related the events of the day to me when she got home that evening, and being curious about such things, we decided to make another trip out there the following day, so I could experience the oppressive atmosphere first hand.   We lived in Hoquiam at the time, and got a late start, so it was full dark when we arrived the next evening. But my sister, her husband and myself were somewhat prepared, having brought flashlights, and a point and shoot 35mm camera. It was a walk of about 300 yards from the side of the road to the river, and the going was made a bit difficult because of the downhill slope, and the fact that it rained a couple of days earlier, and the track was all mud, quite deep in parts.   We walked / slipped down to the edge of the river bank, and stopped to observe the area. It was very dark, and seemed quite isolated, but other than that, it felt normal, no sense of impending doom, no unseen presence felt. We idled around there for about ten minutes, and were about to go home, when all of a sudden there was a tremendous BANG, it sounded very much like a shotgun at first, and we thought somebody was shooting at us. We ducked, and begin to make our way back to the car, when we heard a very loud splashing just off the shore on our side of the river. It sounded to me like a cow or large deer had fallen in, and was struggling to swim. Being young and foolish, I thought this would make a very cool picture, so I made my way to the bank, and was about to peer over the edge to get my shot, when the thrashing ceased, and there was the very distinct sound of a large rock being thrown into the water. This was quickly followed by another, and soon another. I turned to my sister, and she said, "" Oh my God, there's someone throwing rocks!"", and by this time her ""brave"" husband was already well on his way back up to the car at a dead run, and we were right on his heals in a mad panic, slipping and sliding up the dark hill. After a few moments, sanity returned to my sister, and she grabbed my arm and said ""wait, listen."", and we stopped a few yards up the track and listened.   Now you may be wondering why the sound of some rocks being thrown in the water freaked us out so much. This area was quite desolate, and the river is very cold and deep, with eddies that could easily pull you under and drown you. The river bank is quite steep, and it's an almost sheer 25 foot or so drop to the water, with no easy footing when the tide is in and the river is up. So anybody that would be crazy enough to stand out in the middle of nowhere, in the dead of night by a dark dangerous river, and casually throw VERY large rocks into the water, was not the kind of person we wanted to meet at that time. It just felt very wrong, and our instincts told us to leave NOW! Anyway, we stood there listening for a moment, when my sister grabbed my arm again, and yelled something to the effect, "" Oh my God it's coming!!"", and she ran off up the hill in a blind panic, and although I didn't see or hear anything, I decided to follow her.   We made it up to the car, having slipped and fallen in the mud several times, and beat on the door for her husband to unlock it and let us in. We sat in the car for a few minutes, gathering our wits, and decided to get out and have another listen, since nothing seemed to have followed us up. We stayed close to the car this time, and heard no more splashing at the river, but after a few moments we heard a single, large branch snap in the woods off to our right. It was silent for a few more moments, and we heard a soft rustling in the brush from the same area. I told my Brother in law to throw a rock in that direction, to see if we get any response, and he tossed a fairly sizable stone into the general area, and we heard a bit more commotion. I yelled "" Hello there"" to make sure we weren't tossing rocks at a person, and got no answer. I then whistled, and heard the strangest sound I have ever heard, before or since.   Whatever was in the brush attempted to mimic my whistle. It didn't blow air through it's lips, but tried to vocalize it. I don't know how to describe it, it was somewhat high pitched, but had very deep undertones, and you could tell this thing had some incredible lung capacity, it wasn't even straining, yet had a volume several times louder than my own. This disturbed us quite a bit, and we decided to leave.   We returned the next night, and brought four other people with us, and within a few minute of darkness, it would get very quiet, and then the rock throwing would start. Sometimes on our side of the river, and sometimes on the other side. We returned to the area several times, with several different people, and always heard something. I won't detail all the instances here, but will note some of the stranger occurrences.   After about our third visit there, we noticed a different phenomenon, just after dark, we would hear the sound of large rocks being clicked together, usually starting on the far side of the river, and then answered with similar clicking from off in the woods on our side. Several times we tried to duplicate the sound, but it always sounded bigger and louder, no matter how large of rocks we could bang together. Several times we heard snapping and rustling in the brush off to both sides. We went there in the daylight to look for anything unusual, but could find nothing out of the ordinary. One interesting note: we never seen nor heard anything unusual in the daylight. Even on bright moonlit nights, we often would hear nothing. My theory is this thing was nocturnal, and if there was even a remote possibility of seeing it, it would keep quiet.   The only time anybody saw anything strange there, was when my younger sister and I were left alone at the site for a few hours, waiting for our ride to return. We were standing at the river bank, basically just enjoying the sunset, when my sister said, "" Holy S***t, it's bigfoot!"", and pointed to the far bank. I looked where she was pointing, but was too late, it had already disappeared into the brush.   My sister told me she was scanning a gravel bank we had just noticed earlier that day, when a large black object she had assumed was a stump, or piece of a log which had washed onto the gravel, suddenly stood up, and took three quick steps toward the woods, and was gone. The sun was almost down, and the gravel bank was in deep shadows, so she could make out very little detail, but she said it was defiantly not a cow or bear. She said it walked on two legs, and she got the impression it was walking hunched over, and that it had no neck, and massive shoulders, that the body seemed almost impossibly bulky. She said it moved very fast, like it knew we were there, and it was trying to sneak away. Apparently, it was bent over on the gravel bar for some time, she noticed it when she first looked that way, and it was several minutes before it got up and moved. She seemed quite shaken by the event, and it was a long wait while it got dark, us there alone with no way out, and no car to hide in.   I don't think we returned there after that, My sister moved back to Florida where her husband was stationed, and I got a job there driving truck. I moved back to Washington a couple years ago, and last summer decided to return to the area, to see if there was any activity.   The first time I went back, I brought along another sister, her husband and their 14 year old son. We arrived at the site after dark again, I had trouble finding after such a long time. This was in the middle of July, and the moon was quite bright, and we hardly even need our flashlights. We walked down to the river bank, and I noticed how the place hadn't really changed at all over the years. We stood there for about half an hour, listening to the frogs and other night critters, and heard nor felt anything unusual, so we decided to leave. I had pretty much figured that whatever was down there back then had moved on, but I wasn't quite ready to give up.   We returned the following weekend, and this time it was cloudy and pitch black. We walked down to the river once again, and stood there talking for about ten minutes, when my nephew said, ""Shh, listen."", and we did, and heard nothing, and I was about to say that I don't hear anything, when that's when I realized that was what he was talking about. It had suddenly got very quiet, all the frogs quit croaking, and the atmosphere felt dead calm. It began to feel very eerie, and then things happened so quickly, I have trouble recalling the exact events to this day.   Two things happened almost simultaneously, we heard the yap of a single coyote, very close by, which was strange, they almost always travel in packs, then we heard something very large, scrambling up the bank, no more than 20 feet away. We all began to run, because whatever it was, was coming right towards us, and fast! I got a sudden case of the braves, and said "" Don't run!"", then heard very definite, heavy footsteps in the brush, no more than ten feet away, and still coming after us, and said, ""Okay, maybe jog!"", and we proceeded to hightail it up to the car.   We sat in the Blazer for a few minutes with the windows down, listening, and heard nothing further, but none of us wanted to walk back down to river that night. The experience had me so fired up, that I bought one of the new Sony handycams, with the nightshot infrared systems the next weekend, and was determined to get some evidence.  We went out there that Saturday armed with my new video camera, and stalked around until looking for tracks or anything until it started to get dark. We found nothing as the ground there is not conducive to track retention, being mostly gravel, weeds or deep brush. It seemed to avoid the muddy track completely.   We were at the river bank just after dark, when we heard a single loud splash, and then heavy steps and brush crashing as something made it's way up the bank towards us. I should note, that earlier that day we climbed down the bank to the place it always seems to come from, and it was so rough and steep, it took us several minutes to make our way back up the bank, and that was keeping to the trail, this always came through the heavy brush.   My sister and nephew ran off towards the truck, and I walked quickly backwards, filming as I went, hoping to get video of it as it emerged from the brush. It stayed just within the brush, and thus out of sight from me, and it stopped chasing me after I retreated about halfway up the hill. I was feeling brave behind the lens, and started to advance back toward it, and heard to more heavy steps in my direction, and got the distinct impression that I should leave now.   We got back in the truck and left, and haven't returned since. My sister feels it's too dangerous to go back, and I won't go there alone. Whatever it is, it's very territorial, I get the feeling that it was charging us to get us out of the immediate area, and then when we got back to the vehicle, it was okay. The experiences I've had this time are much different than the first time. There was no rock splashing or rock clicking this time, just a sudden, and I feel very aggressive charge to get us out of there.   I haven't been there since the first part of August of 1998, and would very much like to return to the site with somebody that has more experience in these things than I do. If there are any serious researchers in the area that are interested in this site, let me know and perhaps I can take you there. I would love to find out what this really is.

It was near the sno-pac, slightly east of Snoqualmie Pass. We had been driving most of the day, always taking whichever path went ""up"". Around midnight or so, it started to snow lightly even though there were small blowing clouds and huge patches of night sky i.e. moon and stars. At this time I was behind the wheel of my friends big truck, and was concerned about the snow fall. We were riding along a narrow road with a huge drop-off on one side. My friend told me to keep my foot into it or we may slide off! He said there is always a place to turn around at the top of these roads. After turning around, we proceeded back down. The road went straight with a 90' type turn to the right towards the end of the incline we were coming down. To our left going down was a upward sloping bank or hill (actually the top crest of cascades) and as we turned right, a hill or upward slope on our left. As we approached at a slow rate of speed I saw what I first thought to be 3 hunters. Then I decieded it was hunter who was trying to hide behind a scrawny bush and I thought he was releiving (urinate) himself and was embarrased that we drove up. I also thought he was wearing some type of snow/winter jump suit. All of these thoughts ocurred in a flash or split second. In the next instance, we grabbed each other and said (both stuttering) ""DDDid You See That!!!"" both at the same time. It was definetly a Big Foot. Here is my description: Its face was non-descript and sunk on the shoulders with no neck. The shoulders were wide and the crotch was very high. The legs were long. It looked at us, crouched down and tried to hide behind the small shrub and then took off to the left with huge strides up the slope and out of sight. We drove to North Bend and had coffee And tried to settle down. An old man told ""He would give his eye teeth to see what we had"". With that encouragement we fueled up and went back to look for tracks. We had to drive all the way to the top again to get our bearing, so we would recognise the turn. We stopped my friend got out and went to the spot, as directed by me and the truck headlights as I wouldn't get out of the truck. He panicked, jumped in and we left.",none,"Two grown men, still in touch.",none,"After Midnight, light snow,",,26

Weather Wax Ridge Approx. 3,500 ft. elev.",,,"My brother and I along with our wives have never told anybody of the following story. Only our immediate family knows and in fact a cousin has prompted me to submit this story now. My brother and I along with our wives decided to take a weekend drive up to Wynoochee Lake. We were driving in separate vehicles.  When we finally reached the Dam we found that the light rain had started turning to snow. We all decided it would be fun to drive to a higher elevation so we could get out of the slush and enjoy a better view. We noticed that a Ranger in the area had just opened the seasonal locked gate that takes you up to Weather Wax peak. NOBODY had yet drove up this road for at least 6 months. The Ranger had only unlocked the gate and drove away. (His truck tracks in the snow showed this, and it was the 1st of Oct. which is the day the gate is opened as posted.)We drove all the way to the top where the snow was approx. 8"" deep. While we were driving along the top East side of the ridge my wife suddenly said ""Stop the Truck"". She pointed out some strange tracks that came out of the timber down a steep bank across the road and down into a VERY steep draw.  My brother and I got out to look at the tracks and could not believe our eyes. I could not imagine anybody walking around way up here and in this kind of weather. The tracks were very fresh and the falling snow had not yet distorted them. Looking closer we could easily make out toes and heal prints. They were very large both in length and width. It was very obvious that these tracks where just made.  My brother walked up the bank and had to nearly jump from track to track to make the stride! It wasn't until we walked over to the other side of the road and looked down into where this thing went that fear started settling in. My wife began to get upset and wanted to leave right away. We could tell the tracks were very fresh and decided to get back in our trucks and leave. We talked about what we saw all the way back home and for the next couple of weeks. About 6 or so months later we were astonished to hear of Bigfoot searchers with helicopters based at the dam. They were even on national TV! We had not told anyone our story and this had reinforced our belief this was a bigfoot. ",At the time my brother and I both worked in law enforcement. A friend who is also a Police Officer had told me that there was a team of experts up at the Dam with helicopters searching for Bigfoot evidence.

This was off an old logging road.",Humptulips,East Humptulips Rd.,"I was hunting deer in mid October of 1997. I was on an old logging road and was watching a cleared area for deer when from across the draw I observed someone come out of the tree line on the other side of the draw. At first I thought it was a very large man as it seemed to move as one, walking quite comfortably as though it were strolling on a road. I am aware of the roads in this area and was surprised to see that there was a road there. As I looked closer I realized this ""PERSON"" was far taller than a human and the strides while walking were quite long. It seemed to move along as though on a hard flat surface which is why I had the impression at first that there was a road there.   It was a varied color of browns with what appeared to be lighter almost gray brown head and shoulders giving the impression that it was mature. After observing for several seconds it turned towards me as though it just realized I was there and then turned back to the treeline and easily! moved back into them. Still thinking that I couldn't have seen what I saw, I went across to the treeline where he entered just sure I was going to find a road and a fellow hunter up there. I discovered no road and a uneven difficult ground cover. When I entered the trees where I saw this thing go in I discovered that just through the trees was another draw that was very steep and un-hikable.   Having never gave thought to Sasquatch possibilities before I was truly amazed to find that I saw one. I was hunting with my son and a friend but they were not in the area when I saw this. I am positive that I saw something definately not human but quite graceful on two legs. I was not sure if I should tell anyone of this as the thought of disbelievers and coming from a small made me a bit aprehensive. I did tell my hunting buddy and my son, but even took a few days to tell my wife. I feel honored to have been blessed with this sighting and have wanted to have wanted to report it. Until now I had let it slide so to speak but last night saw a show on Sasquatch and after seeing a film of one walking it confirmed my belief that I truly saw what I saw.

53039,304,986,1982,Fall,October,WA,Klickitat County,,White Salmon,State Route 141   ,"Hi, i recently heard a show called coast to coast am during my graveyard shift and decicded maybe its time to tell someone about my sighting years ago while i was hunting,  I grew up in Skamania county washington, thats in the lower cenrtal part of the state, I spent my youth hiking and exploring the woods with my father, i  had heard of bigfoot sightings growing up and remember a story in the skamania county pionner news paper about a deputy shiriff seeing one and them getting a  cast of its foot{might want to look that story up) anyway i didnt believe at all in them cause i had covered alot of dense forest land and never saw anything or heard anything,  my father told me he found a footprint when he was in his twentys  hunting, it was in a patch of snow he said it was kinda old but he said it wasnt anything like hed ever  seen, it was about 18 inches long by maybe 7 to 8 inches wide with toes and a deep impression i still didnt beleive in them,  And like most people some of the crazy stories about ufos and bigfoot in them and and some of the charactors that tell the stories make it easy to make fun of it. So ive never told this story to anyone except one oldtimer who was a trapper who seen them several times.  So heres my story,It was hunting season in the fall of 1982 i was around 21 years old and hunting a area in of eastern skamania county called the nester peak area it has an old fire lookout on top of the highest peak which is no longer in use, its pretty rugged country even though its not all that far away from some small towns.  I had scouted the area several weeks prior to hunting season and saw alot of sign  and tree rubs and about 3 days before opening morning i saw a beautiful 4 point buck checking its rub.   So openin  morning i got in thier about hour before light and waited about half hour after light a heard a loud snap and some loud rustleing in the brush but never saw anything.  the area i was setting at was at the top of a revene or samll draw with road and  mountain behind me and the other side of  the revenes sidehill in front of me with a deep rugged canyon behind that.   after a while i desided to hike over the the other side and see if thier was any fresh sign  as i got toward the top of the other side i heard alot of niose and something going over the hill toward the canyon, i approached slow but never saw anything but thier was this god awful smell in the air ,its hard to explain but it smelled like a  wet old musty dog that had rolled in some cow manure  but really strong and stinky  it was not plesent to say the least i thought maybe it was a bear cause ive smelled bear before but it was just different,the next morning I went to the same place and waited, i heard noise down the revine aways , a few minutes later i saw something walking up the otherside of the hill, thought it was a bear but looked through my scope and was looking at a gorrila type animal, it didnt really look like a gorrila but thats all i could think of it didnt seem real big , i was probably 80 to 100 yards away ,its head was wide and tall its arms were big and they didnt go past its knees ,about like a mans , thick hair on back, top of head and legs  thinner on chest and face i moved, kneeled down behind stump and pickup my binocs,  it heard me and the noise it made was unreal. like a cougars scream but just different and it dropped to the ground like it was hiding. i heard more noise and from the right came another one which was alot bigger, it leaned down by the other one and  it stood up and looked right at me.it was much bigger probably 3 ft taller than the other one , it had alot of hair on its shoulders, hanging down and thick, its face was not that covered and through the binocs i sould see its eyes which were big dark , kinda human like though and a human type nose with large nostrials a mouth that was straight across and i saw its teeth when it opened it mouth they were big and flat not pointed.I could hear it breathing from where i was at. it was loud and deep,it was lighter and if i had to sat what color id say it had dark brown in places and reddish in places it had huge hairy legs i couldnt see its feet much  the littler one stood up and they walked slowly up the hill stopping every 50 ft and looking at me. id say the big one was maybe 7 or 8 ft tall not any taller than 8 and maybe 400 to 500 pounds, not like the storys id heard of 13 ft tall and 1000 pounds they got to to top of the hill and another one came up from the right it was a little shorter than the big one and kinda hard to see, it was probably thier in view i just didnt see it earlier as i was looking at the others they  walked out of sight over the hill into the canyon i just sat thier and was questioning myself what i had just saw, i was scared but just totally amazed , ileft the area and went home , i wished i had a camera so bad but ill always have the vision in my head. i went back thier about three days later and walked over thier where that littler on kneeled down. thier was some hair on a bush about 6 inches long not much an  thier was a few footprints around  i have a size 11 shoe and i put my foot in the biggest one i could find and it was probably 3 inches wider and  5 inches longer that my boot so like maybe 17 inches long and 7 inches wide, thier where some huge 3 foot rocks rolled over and you could see they dug under them, or something had and a couple old rotten logs moved and broke up.  but really not alot of tracks even though i know thier were 3 animals thier and no sign where they went over the bank into the canyon. anyway thats it and i doubt ill ever tell it again, just wanted to let you know thier are real 'SANE' People that have seen.

It was a bright sunny day and I had just rounded a curve on a country road not far from our house. As I rounded the curve there was a long stretch of straight road ahead and appx. 200yds. up the road a large creature had just stepped into the road. I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing so I tried to look for boots on its feet or a coat.  As it stepped into the road it had its head turned toward me and it hesitated slightly and then continued across the road. When it turned its head it seemed as though his whole upper body turned with it. It was standing upright and I would guess it to be 8 to 9 feet tall. It had reddish brown hair and as it crossed the road its arms were swinging in an almost exagerated motion. It took only 3 strides for it to cross the road.  I made a left turn appx. 100yds from where it was crossing. My husband asked me why I didn't drive closer to get a better look and I told him it was because it scared the hell out of me. I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing so I went to a hypnotist and was able to recall some of the details. When I was done the hypnotist said she believed in what I saw. I have spent a fair amount of time in the woods hunting and hiking with my husband I have seen a lot of animals but nothing that even comes close to this. I know what I saw was a Bigfoot.  ,There is a small store on the road where I turned left called the Rosevelt Store and when I finally told my husband about seeing Bigfoot we were in that store and a lady that worked there said that she knows of at least two other people that have claimed to have seen Bigfoot in that area in the last 5 years (around 1990-95),there was no one else on that stretch of road when I came around the curve,listed above,The weather was clear.

The area was pretty clear with hardly any underbrush. I turned around and looked at my boy and he shook his head that he heard it also. I was in a wide spot on the ridge while my boy was standing on a narrow part of it. I started to sneak over to where I could see down the side of the ridge when I heard a snap. I took off to where I could see and thats when I saw whatever it was standing in a pile of old shake bolt cuttings. It jumped and sort of took hold of a tree and swung around behind it.  All I got to see was from the shoulders down. It was a real pretty brown, long hair, and from what I could tell was over six feet tall, but not real gigantic. I kept the tree between us and itself and took off down the ridge. My son saw about the same thing that I did, but he said that he heard a high pitched scream and some grunting. I'm getting so I can't hear high pitched sounds, so I didn't hear it. We went down to where we last saw it but couldn't find any sign of what it might be. Normally there is lots of elk and deer sign in the area, but this year there was absolutly no sign. It was as if everything moved out of the area...

Three guys, can't remember all of their names, but one of them was Peter Byrne from Oregon, and it seems the other two were from Paulsbo, WA. They came to my place in Westport, WA, and I took them up to where we had seen it.  They seached for quite a while and said that they found tracks but weren't sure about them being human or not. I told them that we hadn't been in the area of the tracks, but that other hunters hunted the ridge and it might be their tracks. They figured from our story that for sure we saw a ""bigfoot"". I remember them saying that they sure wished they could have seen what we saw up there.  I've hunted all of my life (I'm 64), and know that whatever it was, it wasn't a deer, elk, bear, or anything else I ever seen before. I had a float house on the North River and hunted this area for about 40 years and other than one other year of seeing no sign, we always had good luck on the deer and elk.

At the beginning of this road near Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center there was a pannel indicated that overnight stays were not permitted. When I arrived at the car-park around 10.30AM, there were no other cars. I hiked to Grand lake and Moose lake that I reached at about 12.30. I stay there about one hour and then I return via the ""Badger Valley trail"". At about 4.45PM I was at the bottom of Obstruction Peak just bellow the car-park and I decided to stop to have a rest before climbing.   So I looked around and noticed two ""hikers"" who where walking on the ""Elk Moutain trail"" towards the car-park. I looked at them with my binoculars because I didn't see anyone for the whole day and I was curious.  They were at about 500 meters from me in the late afternoon sunshine and I was in the shadow so I think that they couldn't see me. My binoculars are not very good but I immediately noticed that they carried no equipment (no bags, no sticks...)and that they seemed to be very tall. There were no trees on the trail to confirm that impression but they really seemed to me very tall, specially the second one.  Then I notice that they were ""dressed"" in a uniform dark colour from the top of their heads to the tip of their hands and legs (I couldn't see their feet because I was below them). I could not see any other colours on them even on their faces or their hands. I thought that they were looking like giants dressed as the police special forces men!  I decided to look specially at the second one because I could not see the two of them in the same time in my binoculars. I noticed he had a strange way to walk: His head was down like he was looking at his feet and his arms which seem very long (the hands were at the same level than the knees) were moving amply. It was like he was tired (because of the position of the head) and alert (because of the movment of his arms and legs) in the same time!  At one moment the first one who was walking about 10 meters ahead stopped to look at the second one but didn't wait for him and continue to walk. Then I began to think that these two hikers were really strange and I realise that they were walking in the same direction than me so I climb to the car-park as fast I can to check if they had a car there. I was thinking that if there was another car beside mine it would prove to me that everything was OK and that these two ""hikers"" were just like me. But when I arrived at the park there was no other car so in a very short time I thought that:  1- it was almost the end of the day.  2- We were 6 miles from the concrete road.  3- It was forbidden to make an overnightstay in this area.  4- These two strange looking ""hikers"" didn't carry anything on their back to spend a night in the outback.  And I thought about the patterson film I saw on a  TV show some years ago so I decided to get out of  there very quickly. I did not see any car or people until I reach the concrete road and the Hurricane ridge visitors center.  I know now that the patterson movie is maybe not the hoax I thought it was.

I was camping with a friend of mine. I'm not quite sure how far up we were, although I know we had just followed logging roads up to a spot near ""Clear Lake"".  We were awakened early in the morning (approximately 5am) by howling and screaming all across the forest - we assumed several beings were trying to communicate with one another.  I have spent most of my life living at the edge of a national forest and have spent much time hiking in the wilderness. I am familiar with the many strange mating sounds of deer, elk, bear and other creatures - and the sound we heard that morning absolutely wasn't recognizable to me until I listened to some sound bites of bigfoot howls online.  This next detail may or may not be relevant since it is quite inconclusive, but I'll mention it nevertheless. As we began to stir around 7:30am and decided to continue with our plan to take a hike through the woods, a large, dark, agile creature ran crashing into the forest as we approached. I cannot in that case be wholly certain that it wasn't simply a bear that had simply come a little too close for its own comfort.  We were the only campers in that particular area that night, although I'm sure there were others within a one or two mile radius of us, since a dog barked incessantly during the howling earlier that morning.",Just the animal that ran off in to the forest...,2 - sleeping,,"It was still quite dark but dawn was approaching.

I was staying at a friends home in the Colville Washington area. I was sleeping on the floor near the window, in the downstairs bedroom of my friends home. The windows are tall and narrow grouped three below and three above with a heavy wood beam dividing them. the second set of windows are 7-8 feet from the outside ground. I awoke to the sound of a loud grumbling/humming type noise, hard to describe and unlike anything I had ever heard before.   I looked up and saw something looking in the upper window. I saw a shoulder and arm and side of hand as if someone were cupping it to look in. I saw only an outline, but the head was large with wide neck and broad shoulders, arm looked very muscular. I was terrified, trying to wake my friend who was in a nearby bed, A .30-06 was located on the other side of the room where she could reach it, but I could not and I was too scared to go for it. My friend did not fully wake and see this incident, but mumbled something about it possibly being a drunk neighbor who sometimes came around. My friend rolled over and went back to sleep. I had met this neighbor previously and  he was about 5'11, and very skinny, this was not the neighbor. In order to see into this window the ""thing"" would have to be very tall, at least seven feet tall and there is no object outside for it to stand on. The ""thing"" looked in for about a minute ( I am guessing at the length of time, I was very frightened) , then left, I heard it walking outside around the side of the house. I heard it walk into the woods and resume making the deep singsong type humming sound. When my husband and friends husband returned from their nightshift at work the next morning, we looked for prints or any indentations and found nothing as the dirt was packed hard. I know this was not the neighbor, but cannot say for sure what it was, only that it was big and I was very frightened.     ","October of 1984 or 85. We now owned a cabin about a quarter mile from home mentioned above. One evening between 11:30-midnight, I let our puppy out for walk and was standing on the porch waiting for it to do it's business. I heard a scream, not a cat, not any animal I have heard before. The dog freaked out and ran into the house and would not go back out. I heard two or three scream altogether. I was not scared as it did not seem close, but I went back into the house.","Self, friend was present, but half asleep and did not see what I saw.

My first encounter was 2 years ago with my uncle up towards Humtulips. We were goin hunting for bear and cougar. We had to park right next to the highway at a locked gate and walk in. After walking a while, probably about 2 miles we start goin around this corner and somthing to our right about 50-75yds in front of us in the thick brush started banging what sounded like a rather large stick/club against a tree. We both stopped and looked at each other and I asked him do u hear that and he replyed yes, Then i asked him what it was and he didnt have a clue and I thought that was strange cause he spends every minute he can in the woods, he has his whole life. Then after we stoped for a minute the pounding stoped then we start walking towards it and it started pounding again. The only thing going through my mind was bigfoot, so just to be safe I loaded a 30-06 cartridge into my chamber. Every little bit we would stop and the pounding would stop until we got right up to it. We looked around but couldnt see anything it was so thick and we listened for somthing to take off running but we never heard anything so we proceeded on and never heard anything from it again. After I got home I was thinking about it and I thought maybe it was a bear slamming a smaller tree onto a fallen log but bigfoot just stuck in my head for some reason I knew it wasnt a bear, it was just to weird, then about a month later on the news there was a bigfoot expert on and he described what I heard exactly. He said he thinks that it is a warning of some kind.   The next 3 happened all last year in 2000.   The first one of the year was when me and 2 friends were camping out at Humptulips. We have been sitting around the campfire for a while now with LOUD music playin the whole time we were there and it was about 1am and we all decided to get some sleep so we got in the tent and we were layin there for about 5 maybe 10 min at the most and somthing about 30ft from our tent picked up a rather large rock and dropped it on the ground, i sat up right away and said did u guys hear that and only one of my friends did so I grabbed a flashlight and went out there and there was nothing to be seen, but it wouldnt be that hard to hide when its pitch black out and theres woods all around. Everyone says it was probably somthing just kicked a rock, It wasnt, somthing picked up a rock and dropped it. It didnt skip on the ground like if something would have kicked it, it was one solid thud. If you know somthin that would or could pick up a rather large rock and just drop it I would like to hear from you cause the only thing I can think of it being is bigfoot.  The second encounter was with my friend deer hunting. We were out in the black creek area and we pulled up to this clearing and got out of the truck and not even 30 seconds out I heard the pounding like with my first encounter 2 yrs ago, we sat there for a little bit listening and it kept goin and wasnt stopping so we decided to try and find it. We went down the road and stopped every once in a while to listen for it and we finally found a canyon closer to it then another one started but then the first one got farther away. It was like they were communicating by it, one would pound on a tree then stop then the other one would start. We never did find them it was starting to get dark so we decided to head home and that was the last of that one. I havent been back to that area since but i plan on it soon.  The third encounter was out in north river on the c line. I was elk hunting with my grandpa and we took a spur off the main road and we drove down and found a beaver pond frozen and we stopped and ate and bout 15min later we started to head back out and my grandpa looked down a dead end spur and we got just past it and he slammed on his breaks and said I just seen bigfoot so he put it in reverse and went back fast but it was gone. So we drove down to take a look and but couldnt find it although we found about 5 grouse beds and a pile of grouse feathers and a grouse leg in the middle of it, the feathers were in a neat pile and i thought that was wierd. Then as im looking around I found one visible track from the bigfoot and it was bigger than the size 13 boot I was wearing and I can also see a trail of footprints not very clear prints but they were leading back into the woods with grouse feathers from a different grouse on the trail. Im looking around in the trees and i can see where it was sneaking around through the trees up to the grouse, so we must have caught it when it was eating. Not right when I got there but after a little bit of looking around I noticed a smell, it wasnt very strong like ive heard of a bigfoot smell but there definatly was a different smell there. I havent been back to that site since that day but I want to, I wanna set up a camera so I can get a good picture of it.",,"1st- 2, me and my uncle 2nd- 3 were there but 2 heard it, me, and 2 friends 3rd- 2, me and my friend 4th- 2, me and my grandpa",,"All except the one were during the day, and were all over cast.","1st encounter (1998)-thick brush and big timber 2nd encounter (2000)-right at the humptulips river with timber almost all around and a bluff on the other side of the river. 3rd encounter (2000)-this was all in tall timber, evergreens 4th encounter(2000)-pretty tall timber, very thick and dark",
53037,373,1160,1996-97,Winter,,WA,Kittitas County,,Cle Elum WA,"Hwy. 10, across the river from I-90","I live in Cle Elum Wa. During the winter of 96-97, which is the winter we in the Upper County had an accumulative 17+ ft. of snowfall, my little herd of seven horses was boarded on a mountainside pasture 7 miles east of our house, at a place along and above the Yakima River.   It was in the middle of winter, maybe January, that I heard something, and it was like nothing I have ever heard before.   To feed the horses, we had to drive up a long, somewhat winding driveway. But, with the snowfall, we couldn't get my truck up that steep drive, so we ended up going out late each night with two bales of hay in the back of my SO's Subaru. We had to drag those bales up on foot, from the road. It was tiring work, because of the deepness of the snow and the steep incline of the drive. We'd had to dig a little spot through the plowed snowbanks to park the car just in case someone came along the road, as it was not really wide enough for cars to pass. (It was so deep that one horse walked out over on top of the barbed wire fence, without a scratch on him.)  My BF (boyfriend, not BigFoot) worked late, and would not get home til 10 or 11, and we'd go out to feed most nights around midnight or shortly thereafter. After feeding the horses in the open corral behind the barn, I would sometimes walk out into the darkness beyond the barn, and howl to see if the coyotes in the area would answer me, which they often did. (The house was fairly isolated along this canyon road. I wouldn't have done this if there was a possibility of getting shot by a neighbor.)  One night, after directing my call to the east, where the coyotes usually were, something very big answered with a howl of its own from the hillside behind me. It had amazing lung power...it was extremely loud! It scared me a bit, as I did not know what the animal could be...it was most definitely no dog nor coyote nor wolf.   I only had a weak flashlight with me, and I couldn't see what it was that made that call. I was not going to go up and find out what was up there.   The only other person who was there was my SO, George.  He jokingly said it was just someone's rottweiler, but I told him that was no dog. There was a summer cabin further up the mountain on the one road that goes up on top, but that road is not kept clear by the county, and there were no snowmobile tracks up there during this time from the  highway.   What is up in that general vicinity of where the howler was, are a couple of year round springs, and we had salt/mineral blocks up there during good weather. (Also, I have a small flock of chickens, and when they passed on, I would bury them in warmer weather but in the winter, would take their bodies out near the tree line for the coyotes. We had a stray dog come in and dig her way into my chicken yard and house and butcher quite a few of them.)  One of my Appy geldings was acting very strangely quite often...he would always bring up the rear of the herd when I would call them in, and he often acted like he was on alert for something. I could never figure out why that was, but he would not want to go in to the corral to eat with the others. I would almost have to drag him in there. He would keep looking out towards the dark, out towards the trees, and would be very nervous. I would walk out in that direction, shining the biggest flashlight we had, but could never see anything that would make him act so spooky. Coyotes answering me were always distant, and when we would see deer or elk in the daytime, they never bothered or got any  reaction from any of the horses.  We went home, and I kept insisting to George that what answered me was no dog....I have been around dogs all my life. (I know dogs, he does not.) It didn't sound like a dog or wolf howl as it was much deeper, and of course had much more volume than any dog or other canine would be capable of.   It was a year or so ago that I came across some bigfoot sites, and I played some of the recorded .wav files. I got chills when I heard the one howl recorded in Columbiana County, Ohio, as it was almost exactly what I heard that night that winter, but what I heard was much much closer to me.     I also noted that in this county, just a few months after this experience, a woman heard a bigfoot in the Teanaway area, which would be just north of where my horses were kept.   I believe what I heard was a bigfoot. I should point out that I did not feel threatened in any way when this happened..it scared me due to the (guesstimated) size of the creature that howled back at me, and the fact that I did not know what it was, but I didn't feel the need to turn and run for safety.   Had I an inkling that it was indeed a lost or stray dog, or that it belonged to someone in the area, I would never have simply left it there. I would have gone to try to coax it to me, or followed up on finding dogtracks, etc. and gotten the dog some help. (Not only for the dog's sake, but stray dogs can harass or harm horses, and I wouldn't leave any dog to cause problems for my horses. Horses must conserve every bit of energy they have, esp. in such a harsh winter as that one. I HAVE contacted people about any dog that has harassed my horses, as I had to do prior to that winter when my horses were harassed by a border collie mix. I didn't want to have to have the dog shot.) Had I thought it was a wolf, I would also have done something to protect my horses.  ","Just the one horse who acted as though he was on alert that winter, often not wanting to go into the always open corral behind the barn where we'd feed. I would manage to get him in to eat, but it took some coaxing and effort to do so. ",One witness besides myself. We were feeding horses. ,"Just the incident on your site the following July, in the Teanaway area north of this incident.   The elderly couple there lived there for years. At the time this happened, Aub (the man) was in the hospital in Seattle for burns suffered earlier that previous fall. His wife would NOT stay in that house at night, alone. She lived with her daughter during that winter. Blanche was scared to death to be alone at night..I often spent the night there with her, and if I didn't get there before dark, she would sit at the dining room table with a loaded handgun in front of her. (A .38? not sure of the caliber.)   I have someone to talk to who is in Roslyn..he says his uncle has told stories of encounters but I don't know if it's Kittitas County where the encounters happened. He is hard to catch, but I do hope to interview him soon. ","I think it was January, but not sure of the exact month.   The weather was cold and clear.  There was a LOT of snow that winter...in the ""Upper County"" there was 17""+ that fell, beginning November 18th through March.   This happened late at night, anywhere from 11:30 to 12:30 or 1:00 am. (We fed horses late at night and the times varied.)","Pine forest, pastureland, not much undergrowth. There are a couple of year round springs near where the creature was, so if it needed water, there was water there, without it needing to get down to the Yakima River.  I believe the mountain this was on is called Hart Mountain.   There is a barn there, and house, which was unoccupied at the time. Nearest neighbor is about a mile down the road. There was also a summer cabin up on Hart Mt. Rd. There are now more houses up there, since the land was subdivided and sold. ",

He did not appear to notice my car as he did not turn or glance in my direction. This creature took very wide strides and crossed the road quickly although he did not appear to be in a hurry. The creature looked very tall and large to me. I looked around for some way to compare his height and discovered that I could see his head above a ""curving road"" warning sign. This struck me because the creature was at least 5 to 10 yards the other side of the sign from me and I could see his head and shoulders above the sign. He walked upright, but slightly hunched at the shoulders and knees slightly bent. His arms and hands hung down palms to the back. His arms did not swing much as he strode across the hiway. I did not see his face because he did not turn toward me so I don't know if he had a hairy face or not. His head and shoulders and whole body was covered with matted, whitish long hair. The shoulders didn't seem proportioned to the rest of the body. They looked more narrow and the head was not proportionately large either. I saw no shape that would indicate breasts. The hips, waist and thighs seemed bulkey and large proportionately. ",,"To my knowledge, I was the only witness. I was on my way to meet my family to camp at Kalaloch for the holiday. I had had to work and my husband and children went ahead to get a good camp set up. I had traveled about 5 hours or more from our home in eastern Washington. Our family and friends have camped at Kalaloch several times every summer for eighteen years and I was looking forward to spending the week with them. We had not come the year before because of building a new home. I was driving along with the music on loud and thinking about what condition I would find camp after Dad and the boys having set up without me! I was also thinking of how beautiful the surrounding mountains and forest were with the rain glistening. The creature took me by surprize and it may have been half way across the road before I realized what I was seeing. ","I was very excited when I reallized what this creature might be. Then my next reaction was one of fear because of its size and shape, although he did not look particularly aggressive or threatening. I wanted to stop and observe where he had disappeared into the woods, but I couldn't do it. Instead I locked my doors and slowed to a crawl in a pullout area right where he had crossed the road. I made a mental note of where I was exactly and how high the sign was that I had compared him to. I wanted to be able to show my husband. I didn't bring the car to a complete stop but did observe as best I could the surroundings. Later that week when I was on the way home I measured that it had been exactly one mile North of the Moclips turnoff. The most unusual thing to me was the color of the creature. I was surprized it was white, well, dirty white anyway. Like the color of a white dog with matted dirty hair. I had never heard of a white sasquatch in Washington before. ",The weather had been very wet all day and everything was soaking wet including the road. But it was not raining at this time and the sun was shining brightly with broken clouds in the sky. Visibility was good for a long distance in every direction. Everything was sparkling with the rain on it. The roads were not well traveled. There was very little traffic. An empty piggyback logging truck may have been 150 yards in front of me. That went around the bend in the road just as I saw the creature cross between my car and the truck. I saw no other traffic for miles but an occasional camper or truck. ,"Landscape on the east side of the highway was very dense, thick, young, forest. The trees were, maybe 20 feet tall or more.

They were walking home at about 1 AM the 1.5 miles to their isolated home on the outskirts of Satsop on E. Satsop, a rural road. They heard some soft noises behind them and noticed a large dark object at the side of the road that they first took for a sign of some kind. As they continued walking, the ""sign"" followed them and they took off running as fast as they could as the dark figure followed along, walking at a seemingly leisurely pace, never breaking into a run, but easily keeping up with the boys. They jumped over the split rail fence of the first and only house before their own, one of them getting substantially scratched by black hawthorn bushes, and pounded on the door of the house. The lady owner recognized them as neighbors, let them in as they hysterically told her that ""something"" was after them and that it was outside. The lady said something like ""Oh, there are no monsters"" and opened the door. The sasquatch had by this time stepped over the picket fence and was standing in the front yard of her place. She said: ""Good God, there is!"" and jumped back into the house, slamming the door. The three looked out of a small window in the door. By this time it was about 12' from the porch. The boys described the creature as being about 10-12 feet tall (subsequently reduced to 8' or slightly more by measurement of tree limbs under which it had passed), hair light greyish-brown own, 3""-6"" long, covering the body and most of the face, flat nose, long arms, wide shoulders and narrow hips, long legs. The creature stayed briefly in the yard, looking at the house. When it stepped back over the fence and walked across the street, the observers cracked open the front door again to observe it. It walked down a 75% embankment from the road to the river plain about 100' below. The boys recovered and walked the remaining 400 yards home with borrowed flashlights and called Wayne Moore, a neighbor, at the first light of dawn.

We were standing on the north side of the road looking up in the trees and trying to figure how to get off the road in the dense underbrush to get a shot at the grouse. I got a funny fealing that something was watching us and could smell a strong smell kinda like a wet elk. (That season was open too and that was basically why we were hunting). I turned around and walked to the other side of the road away from Joe and looked in at the swamp.  I didn't see anything at first, then I saw something very big move. It looked like the back of a bull elk so I spun around and gave a loud whisper to my partner (ELK)! By the time he walked the half dozen steps or so from where he was, to me the thing had stood up. I know it heard me even though I know I was pretty quiet. It scared the heel out of me when it did this. I knew right there and then it wasn't an elk.  As it stood up, it came from a position from squating between it's legs to a full stance. Just then he saw it and remarked to me, ""what the hell is that thing""? I said you ain't gonna believe this but that is a Bigfoot. He was worried about our safety and said, should we shoot it? Can we kill it? I said I don't think we should, we might get in big trouble with the law and he had been there before.  So we watched it for a few minutes. It was very warry of us and kept rocking back and forth nervously. If we made any movements it would duck it's head a few inches and stare at us. He was worried about it attacking us. It made a posturing movement like it meant business so I said let's shoot into the road and see if we can scare it off, so we did and it did. It took off like a bat outta hell in the direction away fro us. He said, ain't nobody in hell gonna believe us, they'll lock us up in the nutt house if we do. We agreed right there and then to stay silent. This happened in the mid 1980's and I haven't said anything about it to anyone but the wife and kids and a few people I trust. ","It made no noise except a grunt like a big ape and a kinda squeel when it took off. The animal, and I am sure these things are animal and not human, was about eight feet tall or a little more. It probably weighed around 400 pounds. It had a grayish colored hair that was probably 12 inches in length all over its body. It had a blackish colored face with lots of hair and almost no neck at all. Its arms extended below it's knees and were very muscular.  When it took off, it used it's arms to propell it to speed and grabbed at the vine maples in front of it then swung them behind it as it took off. I think this was as a protective manuever to cover its back as it left. It had a small butt and ran like an ape. As for sex/ I would guess male. I didn't see any breasts. It had so much hair between its legs that I couldn't make out any sex organs.  In closing, I can honestly say that they scare me. The thing is as powerful as a big bull elk and could rip your arms off easily. And their color could hide them in any woods in the northwest easily. This is a very intellegent animal by its movements, its no wonder they can hide from man so easily. Their hearing is as good as a deer's. I don't know about their sense of smell. I have one other encounter and will add that also.",Yes as described above. ,"My son and I were prospecting on the top of a ridge on the south side of Lake Kachess three years ago when we came across Big Foot tracks in the snow.  We had driven to the end of the Box canyon rd. Which is off the Lake Kachess rd.(gated now). I wanted to explore the big slide area along an earthquake fault along that same ridge. The old road in that area is closed because of the slide so we walked across the slide area and beyond.  I had heard from a local resident that some bluish agates could be found just beyond the slide. We found them in some darkish colored rock then walked beyond to an old clear cut. There was still snow drifts in the timber at that time and we walked up along the timber. It was this area that I got spooked. I got a feeling something was watching us and looked around for tracks. Sure enough, about 50 ft. into the timber their were these big tracks. It spooked my son and he said what are those? I said, well it looks like you are seeing your first big Foot tracks.  I could tell that they were four to five days old because the snow was melting and the tracks didn't have sharp edges on them.You could see the toe marks though. I had a hard time believing this my self. So we followed them from the timber, across the old clearcut and into the timber on the other side.   At first I thought it was some clown with snow shoes in the shape of feet but after following that far I could tell from the depth of the tracks that this thing was heavy. I weigh almost 300 lbs. and i could not imprint the snow that far. The snow was pretty hard packed.  My son was getting real uneasy so we turned around and went home. I've been a hunter most of my life and this is the first time I've ever run onto tracks like these. They were at least 18 inches long. If you send me maps of the areas, I can mark the locations and send them back. ",,"The animal was standing along the edge of a swamp, only 100 ft. from the road.

It was in the summer around the year 1970 I was between 9 and 11 years old. There were woods all around where I lived and I spent most of my time playing in them. There was an old road passable only to bikes, horses and 4 wheel drive that led to power lines and a popular camping/party spot. It was dense forest and no direct sunlight came through the canopy. As my friend and I walked and talked all of a sudden there was a loud growling/screaming and about 50 feet or so in front of us the trees were shaking and what ever it was moved a tree (probably Alder) enough to let sunlight beam down, these were big trees, and it seemed like the earth was shaking a bit. We stopped dead in our tracks just long enough for the adrenaline to kick in and then we ran as fast as we could for the whole half mile out of the woods. It has been along time and I was young but the vision is pretty clear of the trees moving and the bright sunlight. I told my family about it at the dinner table that night and they said some body was trying to scare us but I never really accepted it and my friend and I never spoke of it again. It has plagued me my whole life. All the years before and all of them after I never saw and nobody has ever mentioned experiencing anything like a Bigfoot encounter.

The woods were pretty quiet with just the sound of the river and the distant sound of traffic from the interstate. As far as I know, we were alone on the trail though it's a popular one. We were walking along talking and all of a sudden there was a high, throaty, wailing scream (or rather three or four of them) that echoed off the mountainsides and made the hair stand up on the backs of our necks. We were both raised in Washington and have spent a lot of time in the woods, heard the sounds that a lot of different kinds of widlife make and agreed that neither of us had ever heard anything like that before. It didn't sound like the source was really close but the volume was incredible and with the screams bouncing off of the hills around us, it wasn't possible to judge the distance. It was a scary sound and un-nerved us so badly that we turned around and went back to our car and drove away. I don't know if it was just fright or what but we felt watched all the way. I will never forget that sound and the closest thing I've heard is the recordings that supposedly are the sounds of the Sasquatch.

We are both experienced hunters, and this sound was unmistakably made by a animal with two legs. We both stood still and listened to the footsteps walk by us. As the sound drew nearer, we became a little nervous. It was almost as though what ever was walking was going to walk right over the dirt mound that separated it from us. Suddenly, the foot steps stopped only a few feet from us. There was an incredible vibration in the air as though it sensed us, and it knew, that we knew it was there.

Apparently Near Cyclone Creek. ,Enumclaw,,"I had been camping out on Grass Mtn. for 3 days while staying at my grandparents in Enumclaw for the summer break. I was heading up a small feeder creek (Don't know if it has a name) trying to find the headwaters. Just exploring. I was about an hour from my campsite when I noticed a ""dead animal"" smell that was very strong. I didn't think too much about it, but it did stink. I kept on moving up the creek for about 10 minutes? before I heard something moving through the brush on my side of the creek directly in front of me. I couldn't see it at first but it seemed to be coming in my direction.  I was scared that I might have walked up on a bear kill or something because whatever it was wasn't backing away or keeping quiet. It was about 50 feet ahead of me when I first saw it.  I don't know what it was but it was tall and very muscular, like a linebacker. It had reddish brown fur and huge shoulders. But I don't remember seeing a neck. That's what stands out the most. I remember thinking that somebody must be making a movie or pulling a prank or something up here, but I was in the middle of the woods. I just couldn't accept what I was seeing. WALKING through the Damn woods right in front of me!! Needless to say I started to back down the creek.  I backtracked through the path I'd been cutting and was moving pretty good. I'd been heading back toward camp for maybe 20 minutes? when I got cold chills all over my body. I hadn't been able to walk away from that smell. It seemed to be moving WITH ME.  I had been running like hell down a cut path and it was out there in the underbrush keeping right up with me. I just dropped my day pack and started running the best I could down toward my campsite. I made it back in about 15 more minutes. I was all torn up from the briars and underbrush. I only stopped long enough to get my breath back.  I realized that the smell had come all the way down to the campsite. It was as strong as when I first ran into it an hour earlier. I think whatever animal I ran into up there had followed me back. But it didn't show it's face again ( I think it was just trying to scare me off it's territory?) I didn't even pack up my tent, I didn't want to be up there by myself any more.

I was doing some fishing and walked to the bank down a small trail when I spotted it. I thought it was a bear so I stopped and slowly started to walk backup the trail. I walked about 5 yards and turned to see if it was following or had left. When I stopped and turned around to see this ‘bear’ it stoodup on it's hind legs and looked right at me. It was not a bear.  It was about 7-71/2' tall. It walked very quickly to the north and disappeared into the brush and trees. I was to scared to follow it and in shock. I do not believe in Bigfoot, I still am not sure what it was I saw. It may have been a bear but it looked like a large hairy man (no neck to speak of or really any hair on the face) and it walked upright taking strides as a man. This was in 1991. I no longer live in Washington but now in Colorado.  When I saw the creature go into the forest I stayed frozen for a good 15 minutes listening to hear if it might be coming. After then I walked overto where it had been. There were only two footprints of any real detail in the rocky sand. I wear a size 13, these were 15-16 inches, 5 toes, no claws or ""pad"" prints like a bear. I am a ordained Assemblies of God minister and I do not wish to get involved in this kind of stuff but my wife said I should tell someone.

We were walking for about 4 hours down a game trail when we heard strange grunting sounds, almost like a buck (deer) during mating season. Being an avid hunter though, I knew it wasn't a deer. We walked quietly towards the sound, hoping to find perhaps a bear or something. We were both armed with military type rifles, so we were not fearful of our safety.   Moving another 100 meters or so, the sound became louder and more frequent. The sound was now accompanied by the crashing of rocks. As we rounded a bend in the trail, just SE of us I spotted what appeared to be a huge black bear standing upright. It didn't see us, and it was only about 80 meters away, but the woods still masked it. We moved even closer, and now it appeard as if there were more than one. As we got close enough to make the creature, it was nothing either of us as seen before.   It was about 6'5 or more, it had a huge upper body and it appeared to be lacking a neck. This was NOT a bear. My buddy and I looked towards each other, remaining silent and using hand signals. We moved away, we were both scared to death! Don't ask me why, we were armed to the teeth but we just didn't know what we had just seen. We moved back to the safety of the bend we just rounded and began talking about the possibilities. We both concluded it was a bigfoot we just ran into.   Now confident we were able to defend ourselves (we talked about old stories of them being hostile.. I knew nothing about them), we moved back to investigate. Actually, we planned on confirming this was not human or a common animal, then we were going to terminate it. Yes, we though we would be famous..  As we moved back towards the last known location, we were unable to find the creatures. We found evidence of their being there, two rocks that weighed at least 200lbs were sitting one on to of the other (fresh marks on them as if one was dropped on the other from several feet) and broken branches. We didn't find any foot prints, but there was a lingering odor...like animal dung but more powerful. We got the heck out of Dodge and told no one, until now.   We looked in the base library and discovered that there were laws on the books protecting these creatures in many states. I am glad we didn't run into it (them) again.   I don't really know what it was trying to do.

There were no houses or dwellings within about 5 miles at that time, just south of Mt Adams wilderness. As we called with a turkey gobble lacator call an image of what I thought was another hunter, stepped out of the timber approximately 200 yards away. The figure was sneaking towards us, thinking this was a hunter trying to get a late shot at a Gobbler my father stood up and gestured to the ""Hunter"" with a wave, and in a low voice said have you seen anything today. The shape, which now was about 100 yards away bolted down the slope away from us just inside the tree line. Both of us looked at each other in dissmay as the figure dissapeared into the dark timber. We both walked down to the area that the figure had been standing, thinking that maybe we were tresspassing on private land connected to USFS land and the guy was running back somewhere to get help and run us off. As we arrived where the figurer was standing I already found that I had missjudged the distance we walked about 350 yards to a group of scrub oak trees where the figure had been standing.

I always took showers at a campground on Harstine Island. At about 11:30pm I was traveling north on the Island and was doing the speed limit and watching out for deer in the road because there are a lot of them on the Island. I was comeing up to the grange hall turn where there is a connecting road that travels south on the eastern side of the Island. There is a hill at the point of the intersection and I slowed down to the recommended speed because there is a hairpin turn just down the other side.  As my light's came over the top of the hill I could see into the large pasture next to the road where it turned left. It was a clear fall night and the moon was out so I could see very good.  I noticed something standing in the field couldn't remember seeing it before. I thought it was a tree stump at first but there wasn't one there before. Then I thought about the horses that are usually there in the daytime but it just wasn't it. I was slowing down to about 10-15 mph so I could turn left when this thing turned it's head and looked straight at me. I remember quickly slowing the car and almost came to a stop. As I rolled through the corner it turned in the same direction and walked at the same speed I was rolling.  It was absolutely HUGE! It wasn't very far from my car maybe 40ft. The field is about 3-4 ft below the road and this thing towered over me so I had to look over the top of the steering wheel to see it. I could smell it and it burned my nose. My window's were up but the heater was on. It took long stride's and was actually moving faster than me and I stopped the car because I thought it was going to come over the barbed wire fence into the road in front of me. It walked down the fence line and I folled at a distance but I could still see it very clearly.  At the corner of the fenceline the road turn's sharply to the right and it just stepped over the fence with no trouble at all. I remember feeling scared to death and the hair on my body was standing up. It crossed the road at the corner and disapeared on the other side in the brush.  The turnoff to the park is about a 1/4 mile past that and to the left. I raced to the campground and took my shower as quickly as I could.

We had walked through a half mile of woods and through a clearcut about half mile wide. On the way back to the truck and upon leaving the clearcut and entering the woods, I felt the hair raise on the back of my neck and I thought it might be because it had gotten dark and my senses were playing tricks on me. But after walking through the woods a quarter mile and getting closer to the truck, we both heard very distinct and loud knocking of a piece of wood striking another piece of wood about 12 - 15 times. The noise was coming from near my truck. Then we heard two more and it stopped. We got to my truck and I realized I had left my dome light on. We grabbed my spotlight and waited near the truck for a half hour to hear more knocking and we also knocked two pieces of wood together ourselves but couldn't get a reaction. I shined the spotlight into the forest and suddenly we heard what sounded like a big man take off at a sprint though the woods. I know what deer and elk sound like and this sounded like two feet running through the woods at a sprint. This was no deer or elk. My heart started pounding.

My platoon was airlifted by helicopter out of the main post area for a one week manuever. It was after dark when we left and not being originally from the area, it was difficult to get my bearings. We were in the air around an hour before we landed and began our mission. All I know for sure location wise is that we were close to the Nisqually River and Mt. Rainier. The last night we were in the field, I was assigned to the LP/OP (listening post/observation post) in our defensive position's forward area.  After a week of almost non-stop war games we were advised to expect a non-eventful night and to try and get some rest. My unit was set up in their defensive positions on a hill approximately 1/4 mile to my rear. I was in my foxhole alone with a wired field phone. My job was to notify HQ if our perimeters were breached. Not anticipating contact that night, I prepared myself for some needed rest.  Being from West Virignia, I am used to the woods and am comfortable in that setting. Around 2am, I heard loud pronounced footfalls to my front and right. I am certain they were bi-pedal. Thinking our trainers might be trying to harass us one more time, I prepared myself for my duties. However, all I heard were those footfalls continue to my left and away. Then I smelled what I can only describe as rotten cabbage or hot garbage. Very putrid. It actually made my eyes water. About 45 minutes or so after it left my immediate area, I heard a scream I still cannot describe. It sounded painful and maybe even a bit lonely but it made the hair on my neck stand up!  It was at an estimated range of a couple of miles perhaps. I nearly jumped up and ran back to my unit but I was afraid of getting into trouble and of being ridiculed so I stuck it out.   Additionally, there is so much deadfall and underbrush, I could have seriously hurt myself out there at night. I never saw a thing, but feel I may have experienced a sasquatch creature. The next morning, the smell still lingered in the air. Needless to say, i did not get any sleep that night. This has made a lasting impact on me personally as I am now interested in the research of these creatures.",The woods seemed to have gotten even quieter about the time I heard the footfalls come through my area.,"No one else in my platoon ever mentioned anything unusual that night.

I was a member of an airborne infantry unit designated as a ""Long Range Surveillance Detachment.""  In brief the unit's mission was to deploy 4-6 man teams onto a battlefield and conduct surveillance operations of enemy supply lines and troop movement corridoors. During that month the unit deployed my platoon into a drop zone known as Merril Drop Zone around 0300 a.m.The platoon's teams were to conduct surveillance operations of predesignated road intersections for a 48 hour period then link up together at the area known as Cat Lake in the South Rainer training area. From there we were to walk back to the barracks. All went as planned until the link up date.   Being a native Pacific Northwesterner and having a heart stopping run in as an eight year old with what I still believe to have been a bigfoot, I will not discount ""stories"" of bigfoot type info until they have been researched. There were at the time of this incident several stories about the ""Cat Lake Monster"" which had been circulated by the old timers since the early 80's.   There were about 13 of us in the platoon at the time and we were planning to just bag out for the night and not play the typical Army game of having a ""watch"" up all night. The night was very clear, which was unusual for this time of year, but the woods surrounding Cat Lake and the adjacent Fiander Lake can be almost pitch black. The only light was from a near clearing in the woods at the base of a small hill. The light came from the full moon. As the rest of the platoon quieted down I believed I was the only one awake. I initially heard what I believed was an elk or deer ""huffing."" It was a heavy sound of air being blown through nostrils. As I listened I pin pointed the sound to be coming from the hill over-looking our postion, on the far side of the opening about 100 yards away. The sound came both nearer and louder over the next few minutes, but was still a ways up the hill. As I listened the sound changed to a ""barking"" type, became more intense and was followed by the cracking of limbs and trees. I tried to see into the tree line but it was too dark. I then looked up at the tops of the trees on the hill that were backlit by the full moon. At that point I could see a tree shaking back and forth.The vocalizations became angry sounding and it occurred to me there may be a bear up there, although the sounds were very strange. The tree shaking contnued but whatever was shaking them came closer and closer, choosing different trees. I could by this time hear something sliding down the hill through the vegitation. Several of the smaller trees had fallen over.The area we were in is a natural rain forest and very swampy.There are several rotting trees in the area that can be pushed over with a few good shoves. By this time I was completely on my feet. I still had not seen the creature and was relying on the backlit and shaking trees to keep my bearings on the creature. I realized the shaking stopped at the edge of the clearing in front of me, and I could feel myself being stared at. The feeling was intense and distinctly threatning.  One of my fellow teamates, the only one senior in rank to me at the time, was by this time standing behind me though I did not know it until he spoke to me. He asked what was happening and I pointed to the area on the far side of the clearing where the tree shaking had stopped. As we both watched a large up-right form stepped into the edge of the moonlit clearing. It stood there for about 30-45 seconds and again made the ""huffing"" noise, much louder this time. The creature's form was very heavy looking, with broad shoulders, but very man-like. Shortly thereafter the creature turned slightly to our left and began running through the edge of the clearing. The creature ran in an up-right postion and swung it's arms in large arcs. The steps were loping and heavy. We could feel the feet hitting the soft soil.  It cleared the 300 yards of clearing in seconds and was gone. I turned and grabbed my gear, stuffing it in my pack, thinking to wake everyone up and get everyone moving the opposite direction the creature went. As I looked across the circle the platoon had spread themselves into, I realized everyone was already awake and jamming gear as fast as they could go. The entire platoon was awake, packed and moving the other way in bare minutes.  The following day I and the other member of my team that had awakend returned to the area in daylight. We found several trees that had been knocked over, and fresh dirt turned up on the hill side as though something heavy had walked/slid down the hillside.

The only other time that I have heard anything similar was when I tuned into last nights program and listened to the recording that was replayed by the investigators in Aberdeen. I was relieved to know that what I heard was not my imagination and I could discontinue coming up with feeble excuses to explain what the noise was.  The cries always occurred late in the evening, west from where I live. I am situated on top of Peacock Hill just north of Gig Harbor. Always the cry was answered by another one in the distance. One evening it was so close that it woke me up from a deep sleep. Unfortunately my dogs were awakened by it too and ran outside to silence it. I wish that I had had the sense to record it. You would find it identicle to the recordings you have now. Every evening I listen for it. My bedroom window faces the direction of where the cries came from.

I accidently got separated from my friends and got lost in the woods. While walking down a trail I got the feeling that I wasn't alone. At first, I thought it was my friends playing tricks on me so I just coninued down the trail. A few minutes later I hit an odor that to this day I cannot describe, and I heard what sounded like something was growling at me. The growl or whatever it was, was coming from my left in some thick bushes.  I thought that I come to close to an animal that was eating some other animal, so I began to walk much faster. That's when I heard the scream. The scream seemed to surround me so I can only guess that it came from those bushes. I ran out of the woods as fast as I could. I never looked back so I don't know if whatever it was was following me. I never told anyone about it until my mother and I watched a documentary recently and I heard a recording of what was supposed to be a Bigfoot growling or mumbling. It was the same noise I heard that day. I can't say for sure that I was that close to a Bigfoot but it sounded just like that recording I heard on TV.",,I don't know if any of my friends heard the scream.

We got out and plotted our hike. I immediately began looking for tracks and within 15 min., we found some.   They were bare (not bear) feet prints, about 16-18inches long X 8-10inches wide, and the tracks were about 45-60feet long, (which trailed off into an unsnowed on area).  We've always been outdoorsmen, and seen various animal tracks before, and we even considered that maybe these were possibly tracks from huge boots, which melted outward some, then re-froze, but then we noticed something that convinced all 5 of us. On the top of each print were a huge set of TOES, (but absolutely no claws).  As I pointed this out to my buddies they were speechless. We observed them individually, and in silence as we were all really convinced, staring at each other with flat-affects and big eyes.

I remember that there was a bright moon out because we could see features such as trees, and objects well enough to run without tripping. In fact we could see through some of the pines. That is where we saw the individuals.  At first we thought they were the capture team looking for us. They were back in the tree line when we first saw them. There was a road not far behind them and we could see what we thought were soldiers moving very slowly (not forward or back at first). When they breached the tree line, Mickles decided that we had enough space between us and them to escape if they were part of the capture team. He thought it might be some like ourselves who escaped early and got out of the boundary area.  Mickles got up and started walking towards them and I followed. They were just silhouettes, but as we got closer Mickles waved at them, then they started moving towards us faster; not really running, just faster. Mickles called to them and they came faster without answering.  I have never heard of bears walking upright, and for sure not that fast but I didn't know that much about bears. I did know that something wasn't right and I was really scared. I really didn't think they were bears or people;  I don't know why.  I just know I have never been that terrified and so was Mickles. We ran as fast as we could without looking back, but felt they were gaining on us. I told Mickles to follow me and dove under and crawled up under a large low pine tree. We just lay there. We could feel their presence but didn't dare move.  That is when we smelled this weird odor. I am sorry I can't describe it to you. It was strong is all I can say. We stayed there for probably fifteen minutes and then I said let's head for the road and we did. By that time the maneuver was over and we saw a bus pull up by the compound.

We were sitting and enjoying being where we were. There was some movement in the bushes so we both looked up to see a doe staring at us. She must not have seen or smelled us until she got relatively close. We kept the dog busy with food scraps as she ran away so he would not start howling. Everything returned to normal.   At about 9:00 we heard a rhythmic sound stepping on leaves and small twigs. We both looked up and saw across the ravine from us about 30 yards away, two large legs walking along a path on the upward slope. The legs were covered with very black and long hair and had a definite bend where a knee would be located. I held the dog and the other person walked into the ravine to see if he could see the object up close. He saw the animal's legs step up to climb higher up the slope. As it did he could see it step over a large fallen log. Because of the position were were in and the thickness of the trees it was impossible to see the entire figure.   At that moment all movement stopped and it became silent.

53059,638,1620,1969,Winter,March,WA,Skamania County,"Bear Creek, about 6 miles Northwest of Carson",Carson,Bear Creek Rd,"On Sunday, March 9, 1969 my husband John and I had nothingto do and thought it might be interesting to drive up to our vacation property on Bear Creek, about 6 miles Northwest of Carson, WA. We called another couple who had camped there with us and asked if they and their children wanted to go along. We were primarily interested in seeing how much water was going through the creek.  We arrived at Bear Creek about noon. It was an overcast day, with a drop or two of rain. There was still snow on the road to our property, but it was slushy, and we didn't have any problems getting to the cable that was across the entrance to our camping sight. I was the first one to climb over the cable and start down the road. I had walked down to the bend in the road (snow was still deep in this road since it was well shaded). After I got around the ""corner"" I saw these ""huge"" depressions in the snow, and upon further examination decided they were footprints.  The footprints came from the direction of our camping sight, and then at the bend in the road, angled off toward the creek and just kept going into the trees lining the bank of the creek.  About that time, the rest of the party had caught up with me. I told them to ""stop!"" and look at what I had found. We all stood around trying to figure out how and why anybody would have been walking up the road and then over to the bank of the creek. It then dawned on all of us how big these footprints were....and the stride was enormous. My husband (6'1"" tall) tried to match the stride, and was short of making it by nearly 2 feet. We stood there for quite a while discussing this strange find, and came to no conclusion until the other fellow with us said ""May be Bigfoot did it"".  I had heard something about Bigfoot, but never really paid any attention to what I had heard. He continued to tell us what he had heard about Bigfoot and succeeded in getting us so nervous that we got in the car and left. We talked about this all the way home. There was absolutely no reason for anyone to be in that area at that time of year, and how would they have gotten down to our camping sight without using the same route we had used? The other fellow with us said we should tell somebody about what we had found. I said I wasn't so sure, that we would probably all be locked up in the nut house. So we said nothing, at least for 10 days. I just drove me crazy. It was all I could think of, and finally I decided to write a letter to the Sheriff of Skamania County. Two or three days later, the front page of The Columbian newspaper was covered with a large picture of the ""cast"" the Sheriff had made and a story relating the letter I had sent the Sheriff. The prints measured 22 inches long, 7 1/2"" wide, and 4 1/2"" at the heel. By the time the Sheriff investigated my report, the footprints that I had found were pretty well ""washed"" out from melting and rain....but, the Sheriff and his boys found MORE prints beyond our campsite...2 different sets (the second set was smaller).  The Sheriff used sulfur to make the casts because he said plaster tended to melt the snow. As far as I know, these casts are still in the Skamania County Sheriff's safe. After finding the footprints, and learning all we could about Bigfoot, we were a little apprehensive about going camping at Bear Creek. We finally decided we had never seen anything or been bothered before, so we continued to camp there the following Spring and Summer. We were all much more aware of our surroundings, and kept our eyes and ears open. We did see and hear things that made the hair on the backs of our neck stand up, and never stayed up alone at the campfire.","One very strange thing we noted when we first started camping that Spring, was the absence of all of the small animals that used to ""skitter""around. They were gone....no rabbits, no squirrels, no frogs or toads and very few birds. Where did they go....and WHY? We found strange looking droppings with animal hair, but never had the presence of mind to bring any of it home to have it analyzed. We also found strands and gobs of hairin tree branches. My husband caught a large steelhead, and we left the carcass on a stump to see if Bigfoot would take it. It was gone the next weekend, but who's to say a bear or cougar didn't take it?",,"Due to the huge uproar in Skamania County regarding Bigfoot, an Ordinance was passed on April 4, 1969 prohibiting the ""wanton slaying"" of Bigfoot. I think it was passed to protect the humans, since there were so many of them out looking for Bigfoot they were afraid they would shoot each other!",,,9

We agreed, and met him at a designated place, and proceeded to go to Bear Creek where we had seen the footprints. It was his, and our intent to explore each others experience. He was riding in our car, and when we got to Beacon Rock, he said to slow down. The place where he saw Bigfoot was not too far ahead. He related the following:   He was going fishing at Bonnevile Dam shortly before 4 a.m., Wednesday, March 5. It was foggy, and when he emerged from a patch of fog, just a short distance East of Beacon Rock, his headlights caught something strange in the road in front of him. At first, he thought it was a tree which had blown over the highway...but it was moving across the road. He slowed down,and then realized it was no tree....but a large, fur clad creature crossing the road. He watched as this huge creature continued across the road, and then with one leap, cleared the embankment (14' high) on the other side of the road. He was so ""shook-up"" he had to stop at Jerry's Cafe in North Bonneville for coffee, and was there encouraged to report the incident. He said the ""animal"" was definitely not a bear. He reported all of this to the Skamania County Sheriff.   When we got to the spot where Don had seen whatever he had seen, we parked the car, got out, and Don explained exactly what he had seen (again),and showed us the 14' high embankment which the creature had jumped with such great ease.

St. Helens area last summer (June 98) when Dad pulled over at a washed out creek up past the Lava Canyon to video tape the creek where the explosion from the St. Helens blast washed out the creek. He was video taping on a small bridge where the road crosses the creek, narrating what he was seeing. He said, while standing there taping, he could hear beating of stick on wood from the forest to the left and a return pounding from the stand of trees to the right. He progressed further onto the bridge to hear for sure that it was not an echo, which he was very confident it was not.  Further, since it was midday on a weekday, traffic in the area was none existant and no people had been seen for miles around. Nor were there any electrical lines or etc. in the area, nor work crews, nor loggers, nor hikers that would have been making these noises. My father is not easily scared, I mean that, and he was worried a bit about his safety at this point because of his certainty that the two separate noises were being generated in communication with one another, (left then right, then left at random spaces not exceeding moments apart). He had the video camera rolling throughout the experience and when I reviewed it the pounding noises of wood on wood are audible on the tape, if somewhat indiscernable.  I then interviewed my Dad on my camera that evening to document the occaision. I might add that he said the stick being used to pound the trees or whatever was a heavy (thick) stick that made a deeper sound than the crack of a small stick would make, (hinting that the size of whom ever were pounding must be considerable). Dad stopped rolling tape and got back in the idling truck fearing for his further safety. We have a copy of the tape he made and the interview I made. I would like an audiologist to examine his recording to single out this beating noise and record the intervals and strengths of the beats.","If memory serves, that June we were experiencing many many daily slight tremors around the St. Helens area. Some ranging close to three on the richter. I am of the mind that the Bigfoot is annoyed by the shaking of its habitat (cave environment), and is more suited to notice the low frequency waves that are produced in tremors; as well as the smells of volcanic activity, and were probably driven out of their shelter midday by gases, geothermal heat, or vibrations.","Driving slowly along the road sight seeing.Video taping, while the truck idled at a stop.",,,Stands of trees around and meadows in the distance.,

The ridge we were on was fir trees and heavy brushy groundcover, and the area between us and the flat at the bottom of the ridge could not directly be observed. As we were watching the flat below us for signs of elk, I heard what I thought was two hunters slowly walking up the ridge and softly talking to each other. I could not make out any words, only the soft murmuring sound of a voice. I told my son, who was to my left and about ten feet from me, that I hear two hunters coming toward us and we'll let them come up so they know we are there.  Just as I said that, we heard a heavy thumping sound, which later I thought sounded like heavy footfalls, going back down the ridge, and suddenly saw a flash of black at the bottom of the ridge as something vanished into the trees on the flat. At this same time, my son snapped his .300 Winchester magnum rifle to his shoulder and looked through his scope. He had also seen the black object as it emerged on the flat. I asked him what the hell was it, and he said, ""dad, I don't know what it was .""  He said whatever it was, it was big, black and moving fast into the trees. We both decided it was a black bear, but later on back at camp, we talked about it and there are a few questions that we can't answer.  1. Bears are't very vocal, and I was thoroughly convinced I heard human voices coming toward us. What did I hear?  2. We heard distinct heavy footfalls running back down the ridge. A bear runs on all fours, and we did not hear the sound of brush being ran through. What was running down the hill away from us?  3.

I had just climbed it an hour or so before and it took me many steps (I later did it again and it took 12). The railroad bed was a flat-topped gravel bed they laid the railroad ties and rails on. I guess to provide stability or drainage in the wet climate. This caught my attention.   This large creature then set out across the meadow toward the river with long ""keep on trucking"" strides. It was huge. There were cows in the pasture and it walked between a few of them and it seemed as if the cows only came about 1/2 way up its body. It looked all black and I wasn't sure what it was at first. Trailing behind it there was a smaller creature which seemed to move like a chimp might move touching the ground with all fours. I thought it was a dog at first but closer examination ruled that out.   We weren't really close so I had to do a little calculating, but the size of him between the cows and the 2 strides up the railroad bed made me think ""bigfoot"". He went to a little tributary of the river and squatted down for a while. I thought he was looking for salmon. I lost him for a while then he returned across the meadow. The cows were not in the least disturbed that I could tell, which was odd. We showed some other people on the rock, they were getting high however and could not be considered reliable although they charged down the rock to go look for it. We encouraged them to leave the creatures in peace.   We returned the next weekend with my brother in law to see what we could find. It had rained that week however and no footprints were found.

The familiar ascent had been particularly interesting in that we passed a herd of mountain goat with young that were grazing in the cirque meadow. We had also seen several marmots. After lunch and a nap on the summit we started down. We had descended through the Pass and were picking our way through boulders about halfway down the cirque when I turned and looked back up to where we had been a few minutes earlier. I noticed movement in the Pass. A large, dark, human-like form stood up and looked directly down at us. I stopped and asked my partner who was ahead of me, ""What's that figure up in the Pass?"" Neither of us spoke as we watched the form. The situation was very odd because we knew there was no one else on the upper mountain. Familiarity with the area and subsequent research indicates that there are no other routes to the Pass. It would be impossible to miss other hikers on the narrow exposed trail, not to mention the fact that at the outset ours was the only vehicle parked at the trail head. As we watched, the form began to vigorously wave its unusually long arms up and down and over its head. On speaking later of this odd behavior both my partner and I had clearly interpreted it to mean, ""Get the hell out of here!"" as opposed to, ""Hello there."" The gesture was definitely felt as menacing. (Although I thought of the camera in my pack I was reluctant to take my eyes off the figure for fear I would miss something. We watched transfixed for a few more seconds until low clouds moved in to cover the Pass. We continued down through the woods to the trail head and, as when we had arrived, ours was the only vehicle at the trail head.   Afterthoughts: What we saw was not a bear; its arms/front legs were way too long. It was not a human because we were the only ones there.

I spent a lot f time in this area and know what the various night animals sound like. This was no cougar and certainly not a coyote. It was very much like the latter half of a roaring scream that I have heard played on various bigfoot documentaries.

I heard a loud cracking sound coming from the treeline on the other side of the field, about 100 yards away.  I turned to see, very quickly, a very large dark brown shaggy form tearing-down a branch as it turned and almost instantly disappeared into the treeline.

The nearest intersecting streets at the time where Ruddle road and Yelm Hwy.,Lacy,Yelm Hwy,I was just talking to a friend and he told me of this sight. I was 15 and coming back from fishing. The sun was up but was on its way down. Fishing season had opened about a month before and my rotwieler and I were walking back from the lake. We were walking on a dirt road through some deep woods that turned into two Christmas tree farms the road went through some Christmas trees that were old maybe 15 + yrs. and a younger batch 2-3 yrs. old. We were walking just out of the woods into the two tree farms maybe a couple hundred yards when I looked off to the right and saw a big brown object moving swiftly through the small 2- 3yr. old Christmas trees. It was far away maybe 400 yards and the Christmas trees were 5-7 feet high and at first I thought it was an elk moving at that distance.  I slowed down to watch partly to see what it was and partly because we where going to run into each other. There was maybe 15-20 yards between the new trees and the old and when the animal was a hundred or so yards off my dog kinda whined which I thought was odd because she was not afraid of anything and looking down her hair was up and she was right up against me.   When out of the small trees it came and in maybe four strides it had made it across the 15-20 yards and across the dirt road into the bigger trees It looked to be about 5-6 ft tall and was upright on two legs with hair the color of a grizzly and of the same kind as an ape but in longer strands. I only got a glimpse maybe 5 seconds but it was only about 20 feet away at the last part and didn't seem to have even seen me as it went into the larger trees. I was scared and did not follow the road by where it went into the trees but turned and crossed the small tree farm at a run with my dog right beside me.   Now the questions I have are why only 5- 6 ft tall. I've heard they are 7- 9 ft tall. Could it have been a young one or a female? I also did not notice any strong smell which I am sure I would have remembered. And why would my dog be afraid? Well there is my experience and to tell you the truth I would not want to repeat it what I found to be suprising was how quiet it was around the time it happened and how quiet the creature moved. It did not seem to be running or walking but somwhere in between but it sure covered alot of distance in a hurry. When hearing elk running or dear there always seems to be crashing but with the creature it was quiet I do not remember any noise.,,,"I live in the northwest where sightings are more common.

By the way, we had been staying in the general area for a few months and had heard Sasquatch whistles and howls each night. I used to be a trapper in Montana, and knew exactly what mountain lions and other wild animals sounded like. These sounds had an eerie edge to them.   Anyway, we hiked into the area about three miles from the road, and made camp by a stream. Everything was peaceful enough. But sure enough, once it got dark and we got in the tent, we started to smell the most awful stench, like rotting garbage, or a wet dog, but worse. Then we heard grunting and hooting noises, and stomping going on around us. I finally got the nerve to get out of the tent and shine the flashlight around, but couldn't see anything. As soon as I got back inside, the noise, the smell and the sounds continued. In fact, they seemed to be building themselves up to a fever pitch, and the sounds started to surround the tent. We finally could take no more, and on the count of three, got up and ran in the dark all the way back (three miles) to the road, where we slept against a tree.   In the morning we went back, and most of our stuff was intact. There were scuffle marks all over the dry dirt, but nothing conclusive.

They said they had been there forever, and everyone knew not to bug them. We never went in at night again, but we could still hear their calls often in the evening.

We have hunted together for many years through all sorts of terrain and conditions, and have developed a certain uncanny sense for each other and the mountain. Normally I would not entertain writing this, but I have again been awaken by the re-occuring dream/nightmare of this mis-adventure.   The incident began after some brutal unsuccessful elk hunting on the Bethal Ridge above the Oak creek.  We are both local and know the mountain better than most. We decided to head over to the Cowiche were I had tagged a nice young bull the year before. The area supports a fair local herd and is extremely rugged. We had access to an area through a friend that owned some property and lived a very primitive lifestyle up there. Frank is his name and being a little eccentric his tales of bigfoot and not being caught on Divide ridge after dark were scoffed at by myself and hunting partner Justin. Anyway, we headed straight up the ridge in my hunting rig in late afternoon to pitch camp. We encountered three other rigs coming back down as the sun was setting. They were driving at a high rate of speed. I new one of the guys, he's a logger up there, and he stopped to warn us of the Divide Ridge after dark deal. I said thanks, see ya, and he proceeded back down the mountain, fast. Justin commented about being a bunch of wimps.  We found a fair sight to spend the night. As some weather was coming in, we picked the heavily wooded very dense north slope to put out our bedrolls. The place had an eerie feel to it and I dismissed it as being in my head. We were gathering wood by flashlight for a fire when we both stopped and simultanously looked at each other. ""You smell that?"" ""Yeh, it's probably a couger kill"". A very strong rancid odor, not like rotting meat decay, just a putrid smell. We got a fire going and I put on a pot of venison chili. Justin started building the fire bigger and bigger. This was uncommon for him. I asked him. He stated ""something ain't right up hear tonight"" and I said I agree. We both know fear feeds on fear and dismissed it at that. Then we heard the first whistle/howl.   The first one was distant and we could here clearly due to no wind and the cold. When elk call each other, people not familier with wapiti can mis-interpret these calls as whistles. This was no elk. Justin got out his cow elk call and responded with a short set of chirps. I got out my Weatherby and .44 Magnum. Something was not right. There was no initial response to Justin's cow calls. I put some more wood on the fire. Then came the second shrill howl, in the creek bottom right below us. It was loud and like nothing else we have ever heard and believe me when I tell you we have hunted every manner of ""known"" species in these mountains.    My hair was literally standing on end. Justin said ""we're outta here right now, cover me, I'm pitching camp"". He started packing tarps and gear while I sat listening and watching, heavily armed. Justin is one of the most fearless men I have ever met. He was white with fear.  Next thing we heard was feet walking in the snow, very loud crunching. Justin just about knocked me over getting to my rifle. The scarey part is, we have crashed enough hooved ungulates through the woods to know the sound of four legs crunching snow. This was very deliberate walking, not crashing or running. I screamed out that we were locked and loaded and who ever is out there to come into the light, hoping someone would. The crunching snow stopped. Now both Justin and I are very seasoned and responsible hunters and probably the last ones to shoot at noises in the dark, but this had gone far beyond that. There was something standing out there in the dark, large and not scared of us, which for any manner of ""known"" species in our mountains is unusual.   This silent standoff went on for about two minutes. We could see nothing outside the light of the fire and lanterns. Now mind you this creature was close enough that we could hear it walking in the snow, so we knew it was still there, but there was no smell. I called out one more time and we fired one shot from my pistol into the air. Then all hell broke lose.  There was a loud short grunt and running feet crunching in the snow, and we started firing reloading and firing. We did not stop shooting till we were loaded and well on our way. After a harrowing drive off the mountain at night in the snow, which I do not reccommend to even experienced drivers, we made it back to the my ranch. My wife took one look at us and knew something was truely wrong. Justin refused to talk the whole drive off the mountain. And to this day refuses to talk about it. I have no desire to go back up Divide Ridge to investigate. It is 3:00 A.M. and I'm am writing this after I was awaken again by this same incident.   I am still an avid hunter, but I stick to Bethal Ridge. Make no mistake, this incident has changed my perspective. I would encourage anyone interested in this to spend some time on Divide Ridge, good luck.","One thing that is curious, did the sound of my hunting buddy blowing the Wapiti cow call attract something, and why was it not afraid of human voices or the fire. It was obviously afraid of gunfire. Another thing I forgot to mention is the flashlights were in the truck, outside of our fire/lantern light when this occured, and neither one of us thought about retrieving them to illuminate whatever it was.

53063,680,1691,1961,Winter,December,WA,Spokane County,East side of Mount Spokane above the timber line (NE of Spokane Washington) ,,,"I had just moved to an area called Green Bluff Northeast of Spokane with my Grandparents. I was 14 years old at the time and was fascinated with the area having moved there from Louisiana. Mount Spokane can be seen on a clear day from where we lived and I asked my Grandparents permission to hike up the mountian some weekend. I was told NO due to the distance and the winter conditions. The next weekend I walked up the ""Day Road"" that led me to the top of Mount Kit Carson. I could see the top of Mount Spokane from the peek of Mt. Kit Carson and it looked increbibly close. Thinking no one would know I decided to hike to the top of the mountian. It was snowing very hard and I was cutting a fresh trail waist deep as I hiked above the timber line toward the top of the mountian. After reaching the summit I decided I better follow my tracks back so I didn't get lost in the storm. About 300 feet above the timber line I discovered tracks leading away from mine going on around the mountian. Something with HUGE feet  had followed me from the  timber line part way up the mountian. The tracks looked like bear feet but were very big and it was obvious the (thing) was walking on it's hind feet. I had never heard of Big Foot so could only think it was a huge bear. Then other thoughts came to mind! It's the middle of winter -- shouldn't bears be hibernating? He must have gotten hungry!! I ran down the mountian as fast as I could in the deep snow and soon saw when the (thing) had found my tracks and started following me. It looked like the (thing) had been walking on it's hind feet the whole time and had stayed just below the timber line until it found my tracks.   It didn't take me long to get off the mountian and back home. I couldn't tell anyone what had happened as I would have been in trouble for going up there.  I've told a few friends about this over the years and most doubt  that it would be a bear that high up in the middle of the winter. ",,,,,,Christmas Vacation

53053,692,1724,1975,Fall,October,WA,Pierce County,South end of Lake Tapps,Sumner,Hwy 410,"Late Friday night, Mr. and Mrs. Tallik called in a report to the Bonney Lake Police Department that someone was sneaking around close to their home. Office Hidenrick answered this call and searched the grounds for their peace of mind. In the process of searching the area, he found a 14-inch human looking track (left foot) close to the front porch. No further investigation was carried on by the officer, but he did state to me ""Thinking about it now (Oct 14, 1975), that track could have been made by a Bigfoot, but I thought their tracks were bigger than that."" He also told me that this was the second call to this residence in the past few months.  Mrs. Tallik casted the track found by the officer and showed it to me on Oct 16, 1975. I photographed it. I sat down and listened to her story:  1) This all began in the summer of 1975. It was the start of massive destruction of wooded areas so as to build new homes in the area. The general area was a large swamp (called wetlands now) and during this construction residents noticed that there weren’t as many frogs around as in previous summers. There were 30 to 40 people who moved into the area in the last six months. The kids in the neighbor hood have found numerous (60) natural caves and old coal mines in the area... there is one 3/4 of mile from the Tallik's home.  2) 4 to 6 weeks ago Cindie Ostenson (daughter) age 21,: ""I was driving home from work about 11:15 when I saw 2 reddish looking eyes in the middle of the road, about 7 or 8 feet off the ground. As I approached the spot where I saw what looked like eyes... seemed to vanish in thin air or into the woods near by. But by the time I got close to what ever I saw, all I did see was like a shadow going in front of my headlights.""  She stated that it took off into the woods opposite their house. Mrs. Tallik told me that ""She came down the road honking her horn, pulled into the driveway and jumped out of her car and ran to the front door yelling 'Mom!' in a very frightened voice. 'There was something standing along side of the road with red flaming eyes.' I told her it was probably a deer or some sort of animal. She replied, 'No, it was taller than a person.'  Later, the same night, Mrs. Tallik was awakened by what she thought was an earthquake, ""But after it ended so quickly I figured it must have been a bear."" Footprints were found at the north end of the property the next day. Cindie had been scared so badly that she moved out a few days later.  3) A couple of days later, Mrs. Tallik's young sons were sleeping out in their back yard in a tent, when they heard their dog Heidi, start to whine. She suddenly flew against the side of the tent and the kids saw a shadow of something huge cross the tent and house.  4) A few days passed and one late afternoon, ""our dogs began barking. They were barking frantically down across the street towards the woods in front of our house. My youngest daughter, Shanne called her father to go and see why the dogs were having such a fit. The dogs remained on the side of the road and would not go into the woods. My husband approached the dogs and he told the dogs to get'em, but they refused to move. I was on the front porch at the time and I saw something of reddish blonde color, a man or something, hovering over and running through the woods.""  During this time and afterwards their dogs would act strange, ""Barking frantically and backing up against the front door. This became an almost every night occurrence.""  5) 5-6 days ago, Hedi was found beaten to death in their driveway. I was bloodied across the nose and chest.  6) Tobie Summers told us of a few nights ago that down the street there were rabbits in cages and that several of them were found dead in the cages with sticks stuck through them.  7) 10/12/75 Backdoor neighbors to the Tallik's, Jennie Dempi heard a dog barking up against the side of the house she was babysitting in, then heard something heavy run across the roof. Mrs. Sandy Dempi and her sister Brenda King saw something move in their backyard.  8) 10/13/75 Strong and pungent odor seemed to be lingering in the air, heavy footsteps heard in the front yard and on the wooden porch of the Tallik's. Two ducks were found dead in the yard.  9) 10/15/75 Debbie Schmidt (another Tallick daughter): ""I was spending the night when at about 3:00 am I heard what sounded like 3 or 4 heavy footsteps with very large strides cross the yard. As heavy as the footsteps were it seemed as if what ever it was it had about the same weight as a small horse, 600lbs. Animal screams were heard also. A Footprint was found by the police officer and the next day casted and photographed. The cast measured L 16 3/4"", BW 7"", BH 4 1/2"", there were five toes ST 2"", 2 1/2"", 2"" 2"", LT 2"".

We went out to do some fishing and scouting for the upcoming elk season. Eventually we stopped at a large meadow to look for sign. As I was cutting back and forth through the meadow I spotted a scat I did not recognize. Nearby, perhaps thirty feet away, I spotted another scat of the same type. As I looked at the second I spotted a third, located fairly close to the second. All the scats appeared to be fresh.   The scats were large, about five inches or so in diameter, but not the form or color of any large mammal scat that I knew.  They seemed to be composed of finely ground plant material. As I examined the third scat I suddenly realized that what appeared to be a large, humanlike, footprint was next to the third scat. I started yelling for my cousin. He never did hear me, but I finally saw him and waved him over.  When he arrived I pointed to the third scat without saying a word. Before he even came to a stop he said, ""I don't know what it is."" Then I pointed to the footprint, again without saying anything. He pressed his lips tightly together as he examined it, then simply looked at me and nodded.  J., my son, and one of my cousin's sons, B., both thirteen, were playing back near the vehicle. When they saw the footprint they instantly accused us of trying to play a trick on them. Their joking assessment of the scat was that it was from B's older brother. It did look somewhat humanlike.  We were pressed for time; the afternoon was supposed to be spent in Portland doing some shopping and sight-seeing with our wives and kids. I took a couple of pictures and collected the scats. We put them in the freezer when we arrived back at my cousin's house.   The pictures were developed that night, but they did not turn out very well. Track details, in particular, were washed out  The track was two of my cousin's hand spans in length, about sixteen inches.  Upon arriving back home in Oklahoma City, on Saturday, I began to search the Internet for Sasquatch-related sites. I found the BFRO and submitted a report. We requested confidentiality, which is why the report was not posted.  We did get a lot of follow-up from researchers. I was in contact with several researchers via email, but my cousin was contacted personally and by phone.  As I understand things, the scats were shown to wildlife faculty, but no guess as to their identity was ventured.   The last word we had on our observations was that they were from an area of high interest to the BFRO, and that there were plans to study the area more intensely in the future.","The only other odd thing I can add is that just before we arrived at the meadow we saw a bear. Not that seeing a bear is so unusual, but this bear was running like it had been shot out of a cannon. It ran across the road from east to west.

She said they were almost to the end of my street when a large animal with long reddish brown hair crossed the road in front of them and took one easy step over my neighbors barbed wire fence (mom clarified it was a metal gate) and kept going.     In interviewing the mom, she explained to me that she might have seen the sasquatch Chris was looking at if she had looked to the left into her neighbors yard as she drove by. But, her and her girl friend were distracted looking down the street at a very large man standing next to a 6' 6"" street sign. The top of the sign came about mid chest level. It stood still like it was hiding behind the sign. When they got closer to it, it bolted, taking two steps to clear the road and striding down her neighbors driveway and stepped over the metal 4' gate in one easy step. She said ""the long reddish brown hair swung back and forth as it swung it's arms. Moved very quickly, having a smooth and graceful gait.""     Also, she has seen his eyes glowing in the head lights of her car coming home at night. ""There have been time where I believe it has watched me at night when I have stayed up late working on paperwork in the dining room"".

All these events made sense to this family after their sighting.","Donna P., The friend with the Mom at the time of the sighting","About a year before my intial sighting, I was fishing in the Tilton River at Gus Backstrom Park. I was talking to an older guy about bass fishing at an area around my neighborhood known as the Duck Ponds. He said that ""a few years back"" ( with this guy being elderly I wasn't sure how long ago it really was.) That he was fishing at a hidden pond back in the trees. at about 5:30 in the morning when he heard a noise from across the pond. He figured it must be an elk with all the noise it was making. Suddenly he saw two large hands reach between the trees and part the trees like someone would part a curtin.  Then, he said , it proceeded to walk straight across the pond, and through to the other side. I figured (at the time ) He was just jerking my chain. So I played along with agreeing with what ever he said. After my sighting I now believe him.",Clear cold Saturday night at about 10:30 P.M. The moon was 3/4 to full. Beautiful frosty night.

I stopped my car, and upon getting out noticed that the area was silent; no birds, frogs,or other animals were calling out, which I found odd.  I had started up the trail(approx 1/8 mile) when I heard(and felt) what sounded like someone pounding on a hollow tree in an incredibly fast and hard manner. The sound was coming from my left and I guess it was maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. Approximately 10-15 seconds later, I heard the same type of noise more to the right and closer. I would say within 200 yards. I could feel the percussion as well as hear it.   I continued walking uphill along the trail for another five minutes when I encountered an odor that I had never smelled before. I did note the breeze was in my face.I continued for another 40 yards when something started walking/running rapidly through the brush approximately 20-30 yards ahead of me, moving from my left to my right. Every time it stepped, I could feel it through the ground, so whatever it was was big.  I immediately took a trail to the left that led downhill, as I thought I may be cut off on the trail I was on, and I didn't want to get in anythings way if it was coming down the trail I was coming up.  Whatever it was then moved from my right to my left through the brush as though to cut me off on this trail as well. I then started running to my left diagonally through brush and deadfall to try and cut the trail I came up on. I did cut the trail and ran back to my vehicle. Whatever was there did not follow me down to my car, nor did I ever see it. Upon reaching my car I again heard the same drumming noises, this time the second one was much closer and uphill of the trail I had started on.

After driving for a few miles they stopped and tied the sled on the back of the TK. Several times the sled would tip over and they would stop while his son put it back on the road. When Mr. Becker asked him to put it in the middle he said there was a pile of droppings there. Mr. Becker took a look and noticed that the droppings were from a wild animal, but did not think anything of it until later. They began pulling the sled up the road again.  On the next stop they noticed a trail of large footprints going up the bank. They went over for a closer look and discovered that they were just like human's bare footprints with 5 toes. It suddenly came to Mr. Becker that this could be the legendary 'bigfoot' that he had read about on several occasions.  He kept the kids back so as not to disturb the tracks. He then put his foot in one of the tracks for comparison. He had on a pair of heavy snow boots and there was an inch difference on each side and 2 or 3 inches at the front and back. He spread his legs out next to the tracks to compare the stride. He said he practically had to do the splits to match the stride: which would be about 4 to 5 feet between steps. A couple of prints were pushed all the way to the ground under the snow. With his weight, even jumping up and down, he could not sink half that far. He thought of the pile of droppings and figured it could have come from what ever made the tracks. He thought the tracks were from 1 to 2 days old at the most.  It was getting late in the afternoon and starting to drizzle so he decided to take the kids home and come back another day and get some pictures and possibly follow the tracks to see where they led.

The wind was blowing hard from the east, which helped to carry the sound. We all stopped, looked, and called to each other ""did you hear that?"" ""what WAS that?"" It did not sound human, so none of us thought it was a call for help.  The ridge was not part of the climbing route and access to it required a steep downclimb then up steeply. And since visibility was excellent, so there was no plausable reason for anyone to be over there. It was not an elk or coyote, and did not sound like a dog.

They laughed, but I wondered.   I listened to the Bigfoot Scream 1978 Snohomish recording and yes, indeed, it sounded exactly like that!

53053,851,2303,2001,Spring,April,WA,Pierce County,Hwy 702 is the McKenna Tanwax cutoff road.  I was about 1-2 miles west of Hwy 7. There is a pullout on the south side of Hwy 702 right across from a Century 21 for sale sign.  The street sign says 34 Av S. You can see an old vehicle path heading south into the woods. I was about a quarter of a mile into the woods. I could just see the front of my truck when I turned around to head back.,McKenna ,Hwy 702 about 1 mile west of Hwy 7,"I was letting my dogs go for a run in the woods off of the McKenna cut-off road in Pierce County. I was only about a quarter of a mile into the walk when my dog, Einstein (an Akita/Shepard mix), stopped ahead of me on the trail. He was blocking the trail facing towards the bushes on my left (East), he had his hackles up and was growling. My other dog, Bandit (Border Collie/Chow mix), had just stopped and barked once and then ran back behind me continuing to play.   I walked up to Einstein thinking there was a little animal or something in the bushes. When I got up next to him I heard the bushes rattling off to my left and when I looked over in that direction I saw something really big standing next to a tree about 40' away from me, seemed to be shaking the limbs on the tree to make noise. I also got the feeling it was looking at me but it didn't move behind the tree or crouch down to hide. I also didn't feel threatened.   I thought it might be a big bear because of the shape of it's body. It was a dark color, I couldn't make out any facial features or see how long the arms were. The shoulders were quite broad and there didn't seem to be a neck. Because it never got down I thought it a transient person, but if it was a transient they were dressed in a dark parka with the hood pulled up and were wearing alot of bulky clothing with the tempature above 70.   I grabbed Einstein and we turned around to head back to the truck. Bandit was running ahead of me. Every once in a while I would look back and eventually I saw what ever it was walking upright down the road away from me. The trees blocked the upper part of the body but I could see the lower part of the legs, I didn't see any boots or shoes or clothing.    At one point Bandit was running along the highway and I yelled really loud for her to come to me and when I look back down the trail it looked like whatever it was was now headed towards me, going in and out of the bushes on the right side of the old road.  I know it wasn't a bear and it sure didn't look like it was a human walking towards me. I couldn't get the dogs in the truck fast enough, but when I did I looked back down the road and didn't see anything. I've got to say I never really believed in Bigfoot, but I do now.","I got Bandit at the end of March from the Shelton animal shelter and she seems to have been abused. She doesn't like men. Whenever we meet a strange man I have to hold her back and she won't quit barking at them. She only barked once and then ran off behind me. It should also be noted that I had a bad cold and my nose was all plugged up, I didn't smell anything. I was in the same area three weeks before this around the same time with a friend of mine and we heard a lot of howling while we were walking through the woods that day. It didn't sound like a coyote.   ",Just me and my dogs and they don't talk.,I have a friend who told me about an incident about 7 years ago (1996) off of 304 St E where he bought a german shephard where the person who lived there saw something walk by her trailer.

Porter Creek,"Elma, Brady and Matlock",Hwy 12,"On numerous dates listed within the report those witnesses listed above and I had occassion to examine ""unusual"" scenes which, to date, have been undetermined as to the origin of the evidence found.  It should be noted that all materials used to process said scenes were supplied by the individuals themselves and the results thereof are retained personally by said individuals. Copies can be made available on some of the evidence, with consent of the owners. The time involved was donated by the individuals as well - Therefore, this report is merely a documentation of facts observed by myself and includes some comments made by those listed. It is not submitted as an official case report ""per-se"". This, the Grays Harbor Sheriff Dept. has been asked, and graciously accepted to act as caretaker of this documentation.  On 4-22-82 @ approx. 1609 hrs. I was contacted @ my residence by a private citizen (name witheld @ request) in reference to a number of large tracks found in a fairly secluded area of the eastern portion of Grays Harbor County. The location is known as ""Abbott Hill"" to the local residents and is rarely traveled or visited.  It consists of a two year old ""clear cut"" of privately owned timberlands surrounded by second growth timber and a heavily vegetated forest floor. There is presently one road around the clearcut and one dividing the clearcut with short spurs off of each.  I was escorted to one of these spurs and was shown two large, what appeared to be footprints with human features in an area along the base of a fire trail. The tracks were obviously made after the rains and before the sun had dried the mud as there were virtually no ""rain pocks"" in the major portion of the track. They were approximately 46"" apart and the toes of each track pointed the same direction. No other tracks were visible in the muddy area or along the grassy edge.  A distinct trail could be found leading from the top of a small hill, down hill through 8 foot high Salmonberries, Devils club, Blackberries and other intertwined plants. The plants were either broken over entirely or the tops were broken. The trail measured 36"" across and was approximately 150' long. It ended on the roadway at the point where the aforementioned tracks were observed.  I photographed both tracks and made a plaster cast of the left foot. The tracks measured 15 1/2"" long by 6 3/4"" wide @ the longest and widest points. (see attachments for further measurements). At the deepest point into the mud, the track measured 1 1/2"" deep. This plaster cast was retrieved as evidence by me. A hair was removed from between the second & third toes of the left track & sent to the ""Institute of Cryptozoology"", in Tucson, Arizona for analyzation. No results have been obtained @ the time of this writing.  More tracks were observed, photographed, measured and processed @ the end of the ""spur"" approximately 1/4 of a mile from the first set of tracks. The longest step @ this location measured 9 feet between steps and only the ball of the foot was distinguishable @ the end of each 9' step. From there a trail of broken vegetation & matted grass went down the hillside into rugged clearcut & drainage. The perimeter road was searched for further sign to no avail.  @ the same time I was informed of more tracks located seven miles west of our present location along the Satsop River @ a place called ""Worman's Bar"". Upon investigation I found two seperate sets of tracks together. Both starting from under the water, traveling westerly and ending in hard packed gravel which made tracking difficult @ best. These tracks were photographed & measured by me. The largest was 17"" long by 7 1/2"" wide @ the longest & widest points. The smallest was 15 1/2"" long by 6"" wide @ the longest and widest points. Both sets were made in hard packed river sand and appeared to have been the result of great weight being placed on each foot. The steps measured from 52"" down to 39"". No casts were made of these due to the lack of plaster of paris. Upon return to the scene with the proper casting materials I found only portions of the tracks due to those made by curiosity seekers.  On 4-27-82 I was informed by Officer Jim Young of the Oakville Police Dept. of numerous tracks discovered along the Chehalis River in an area known as ""Elma Gate boat launch."" According to Jim, these tracks were followed approximately 1/2 mile upstream. Veryl Hutchinson (Sgt.) and I went to the area where I photographed, measured, and processed the scene. Hutchinson retained the cast of the left foot. The measurement was 15"" long by 61/4"" wide @ the longest & widest of the left track. Further investigation revealed a trail of approximately one mile. Steps measuring from 59"" to 34"".  On 5-23-82 I was contacted @ my residence by a pastor of a local church and requested to the Porter Creek area for investigation of large tracks sighted in a fairly secluded area of Capitol Forest. I contacted Mike Behm and we met the Pastor and were escorted to the scene. There were four tracks found in the area, numerous photos were taken of the tracks (slide film) and two casts were made of two tracks. Mike Behm retaining one, I the other. An Aspen tree was scratched in such a way indicating five fingers or like items were used to make marks. The lowest mark was located 72"" from the ground and the highest was located 98"" from the ground. This portion of the tree was removed and is held as evidence. Numerous branches were broken from 8 feet to approx. 11 feet in the trees. A wad of approx. 12 ferns, minus the roots were found @ the creek along with two new growth portions of Aspen branches.  A subsequent search of the opposite banks of the creek revealed numerous tracks traveling downstream. The area the tracks were located is a sharp bank, covered with ground salal and devils club. the tracks were followed approx. 1.5 miles and were lost @ the edge of a clearcut.  Of the sightings investigated, no two tracks were of the same measurements. The largest distance between the sightings was between the Elma Gate and Abbott Hill, approximately 9 miles. All the sightings indicated something of great weight (600+ pounds) with steps varying from 32"" between to 59"" between (barring the two of 9' between each). At the Porter Creek and Elma Gate scenes there was evidence of obvious foraging. @ all the scenes there was evidence of great height and weight and a lack of tracks to indicate the evidence was placed there as a hoax.

There were seven people in our party and we went camping and fishing at a very remote lake in the Pasayton Wilderness (part of the Okanogan National Forest, Okanogan County, Washington State). After fishing all day, we returned to the camp for the evening. In all, there were probaly 100 people along the bank of the lake, camping and fishing as we were.  Quite a few of these people witnessed what we did.  I was building a fire between our party’s three campers. One of our friends was playing ‘catch’ with her son and dog. I heard her call out so I went around the campers to where they were playing. She told me that she thought she had just seen a Bigfoot and she showed me where, by pointing to a spot on the hillside where they saw this ‘thing.’ While she was describing what she had seen and where it had come from, this creature stood up behind a bush about 75 yards from us.  The creature just stared at us for a moment before turning and darting into the woods. At this point, many in the campground had joined us, including my wife, who brought the camcorder out of our camper.    I told my wife to turn the camcorder ‘on’ and scan the woods on the hillside, thinking that it might show itself again. About 2 to 3 minutes later, it appeared another 100 yards up the side of the mountain, which was very steep and rugged terrain. The creature then proceeded to run across the hillside, between openings in the trees, jump a ravine and continued behind a knoll where it started walking.   As it approached the tree line, its upper body came back into view. My wife recorded about 22 seconds of footage of the overall sighting.    I spent several more days there, doing additional research and recording, such as attempting to trace its path, compare my stride to the creature’s, and so on. I have some very interesting video footage of this support data, including what I thought were resting beds underneath some of the trees. Also, my tape has a howl on it as the creature had left our sight.    Keep in mind, that I am a novice on this subject of ‘Bigfoot.’ I really did not have any idea originally what to really look for. I did not check for body odors, hairs, or anything like that.",Three resting bed like areas under the trees up on the hill. A howl can be heard on the video tape just as Owen's wife pans back from the image of the animal dissapearing into the forest edge. It is unknown if this sound is related to the event or from near by campers.  ,Possibly as many as 30. There were two people out in a fishing boat in the lake that pointed up to the animal.,"About 3 months later, there were reports around the panhandle of Idaho.","Around 6:00 PM, clear day",Lake and mountains (open hillsides) surrounding the lake.,26
53033,958,2602,1970,Spring,April,WA,King County,Please see my letter.,Scenic Washington or Skykomish Washington,Stevens Pass Highway,"I lived at Scenic near Stevens Pass Washington in the 60--70's.  There had been sightings of sasquatch near our home, and at that time my husband and I laughed about that never taking them seriously.  I lived at Scenic about 10 years and enjoyed taking walks by myself with my samoyed dog. That dog would chase bears away, running them up trees. I always felt safe with her around.  One morning, the dog went with my husband to work and I decided to take a walk down to the end of the road towards highway 2. It was a beautiful spring day and the snow still lay in places on the ground.  I can still see and hear this like it was yesterday.  I had crossed the small bridge going over the small creek by our place and gotten almost to the end of the road where it meets the highway.  That's when I heard the most god awful sound.  I can still hear it in my mind. The sound was quite close to me. I'm thinking about 1/2 block distance (as the crow flys) and seemed to be coming around the area where the deserted railroad bunkhouses were located across where the depot was located.  This animal had huge lungs. The volume was immense. (I'm trying to think of a word for the sound) It started sort of like roar and went to a shrill pitch. Then a pause of about 3 seconds and then the same sound with that shrill pitch, a pause of 3 seconds and another sound.  That was it and since I didn't believe in saquatch I wasn't scared of it, ,just curious. I knew all the calls of the animals around our mountains and this wasn't the same. I've tried all these years to figure out what made that noise. I stopped into the forest service office after this happen and asked them if they had ever heard this sound. I was trying to explain it to them as best I could, but they never took me serious. I recieved the same response from my friends that lived in skykomish.  Then after I moved to Spokane some time later I was watching ""Unsolved Mysteries"". They played sounds that sounded very similar and said to myself ""there's the sound or closest to it"".  I thought, ""no one's going to believe this!""  I worked at a hospital in Spokane and one of my indian patients and I got to talking about my experience. She had seen a sasquatch come into her camp as a young girl and chased it away by beating on a drum. She said the most astounding thing she remembered about her experience was the human look in it's eyes. So the native americans have known about them for years.  I truly think the sasquatch would be found around that area of Scenic, near Stevens Pass Washington. For 10 years I walked all through those mountains, my small children with me and these sasquatches never bothered us.",The next day I checked the area where the bunkhouses were and I saw and heard nothing more.,Just myself,"About a year or two before I heard my (sound) there were  kids from the University of Washington that said they had seen a sasquatch.  They were looking around above our house at scenic going through a railroad tunnel looking for it. My husband and I were out for a walk and noticed these huge boulders rolling down the mountain side. My husband and I were looking up towards the mountain wondering what was going on. I said to him what the heck is going on up there? He laughed saying ""the fool kids said they saw a sasquatch and are looking for it."" Now I am not so sure.",,Please see my letter,4/14/70

Im not sure what is there now but it used to be that when you hit our corner if you turned right there was still black top but if you went straight it was a gravel road and to the left was a logging road.,BattleGround,Main St,"I was either a freshman or sophmore in high school (I graduated in 86). It was about 7:30am and I was waiting for the bus stop (we lived on the corner of a dead end road at the top of a hill across the road was nothing but woods and logging roads. If you keep going straight it goes downhill on a gravel road and there were two trailers back there at the top of the hill. Our creek ran under the road at the bottom). I was waiting for the bus and was looking down the gravel road because there was light and I was a little nervous waiting and I saw something cross the road in one step where the creek runs under the road. The road is big enough for two cars to pass by each other. Whatever it was big and, no, it wasn't a bear; I had seen bears in zoos before and it wasn't any animal that I had seen before.  I got scared and went back to the house and turned on the lights. I did not tell anyone about this. But there were always feelings when we were out in the woods that something was watching us. I don't ever remember hearing any screams or anything but we were fairly quiet people, those of us who lived on the road and at times it stunk; we were told we had skunk weed growing down at the creek. the kids always talked how Bigfoot lived on Bells Mountain. That wasn't too far away as the crow flies",It scared me really bad. But nothing else out of the ordinary.,Just me. I was waiting for the bus. I think I was having a cigarette.,We had just heard that Big Foot lived on Bells Mountain. It was nothing we talked too much about just kids mentioning it. I think one of my friends ( I have no idea where she is now) had said at one point that one had come in her yard when she lived there.,"Morning, the sun was coming up but hadn't reached our house.","Where I was standing was wooded. At the bottom of the hill (I stood at the top), where the thing crossed the road, was a creek and fairly swampy. I think there used be an old cabin because us kids had found old broken bottles and things when we went looking around that area one time. It was a fairly steep hill. On either side of the area was woods we owned the land to the right and it was never cleared. the other side of the road I think is State owned.",15th
53045,976,2760,2001,Summer,July,WA,Mason County,"Please do not contact the people at this location, or post very specific directions.  I asked their permission to monitor at their house, but I do not know their names.  I can tell you that I was situated just off SR 102.  The prison is to the west and Highway 101 is to the east.  The noises were coming from the direction of Highway 101.  Looking at a topo map there are several lakes north of SR102, west of Hwy 101.  I believe almost all the land is Simpson timber land with clear cuts/trees of several different heights.","Shelton, WA",SR 102,"On Monday night (actually early Tues. morning July 3, 2001) I was performing some nighttime noise monitoring at a residence outside of Shelton, Washington.  I monitored from 2:30 am to 4:30 am.  There are a few residences where I was, but the area is surrounded by Simpson timber land.  The Washington State Penitentary is closeby.  It was perfect noise monitoring conditions, clear night with no winds at all (extremely quiet).  Right when I started my measurement I heard coyotes from the direction of the driveway, off in the distance.  A few dogs in the distance barked at the howls.  I then heard some different animals.  I heard 2 or 3 screams from one location and a single scream in response from further north.  These screams seemed to be communicating to each other.  It lasted about 30 seconds or so.  The dogs in the distance continued to bark, although the 2 dogs in the yard with me did not. I was really wondering what animal it could have been.  I would describe coyote howls as an owwwoooooooo noise.  These screams started as a howl but ended in a scream, like ooooaaaahhhcchhh.   The ending part sounded like a woman screaming, but the scream was solid-sounding and not screechy.  It sounded about a half-mile away but still very loud and clear.    Now maybe you can tell me...  It could have been mountain lions, but I am not sure if those animals are 'group' animals.  Maybe it was a mother and her cubs trying to find each other.  It just did not sound cat-like to me, although I have not heard mountain lion calls specifically.","After the first round of calls it became very quiet.  I was measuring the hourly average Leq for a one-hour measurement.  After about 35 min the Leq was 36 dBA.  At 43 minutes, the 2 dogs in the yard of the house I was at went crazy barking at the trees behind me.  The horse in the field to the left of me was snorting too.  My heart was in my throat!  At 58 minutes, another solitary howl/scream occured from the same direction as the first ones.",I was the only one out there monitoring.  I was sitting on the trunk of my car taking notes on the ambient noise sources.,I am not from that area.,"approx 2:40 am the first round of calls.  A 2nd solitary call occured at approx. 3:30 am.

53059,1062,3024,2001,Summer,August,WA,Skamania County,Sounds heard while at Tillicum campsite located about 4.5 miles NE of Skookum meadow.  Possible prints found on deer trail off of hiking trail 21 while going to the meadow.,Stabler,,"Since my wife and kids were away visiting my parents in Ohio, two co-workers (A.S. and D.G.) and myself decided to try our hand at bigfoot ""hunting"" after hearing about the BFRO expedition to Skookum on the Medved radio show and then reading about it on the website.  We decided to camp out two nights (starting Friday) at the Tillicum campsite which was about 4 miles from Skookum, hike into Skookum Saturday, and then leave Sunday morning.  All three of us were sharing a four man tent and after going to bed Friday night, I was awoken by A.S. who mentioned that there were strange sounds outside. At that point all three of us were lying there awake. The first sound that I heard sounded just like coyotes but then I heard a weird gutteral growl like sound (which in all truth kind of gave me the shivers). That was the last sound I heard and before going back to sleep I remember commenting aloud ""weird"".  The next morning before going out on the hike we talked briefly about the sounds and A.S. mentioned that before the coyote sounds there were some stranger sounds that had woke him up (more about this and the other sounds later).  On the hike down trail 21 we found some deer trails that per A.S.'s GPS system looked like they went down do Skookum. We decided to follow the trail and maybe an eighth of a mile down the trail A.S. got excited and pointed to what could have been prints.  The prints were vague but did appear to be somewhat human shaped with possible toe and hill prints (the ground was fairly firm and the prints did not look fresh). I would say that the prints looked like size 12 or 13 feet. The prints also appeared to go down the trail and there were possibly 4 or 6 that we could make out. Since the prints were pretty vague it would have been impossible to make casts and we decided that the pictures probably wouldn't come out well (now I wish that we had).  For the rest of the trip we didn't see or hear anything strange. After the trip we discussed the prints more and of the three of us, D.G. appeared convinced that the prints were the real thing, I was fairly neutral giving them about a 50% chance of being the real thing (I would like to have higher confidence but I was worried that we could be biased in that we ""really"" wanted to see something) and A.S. who had been the first to see them and initially very excited pretty much talked himself out of thinking they were anything of importance BUT he kept mentioning those weird sounds we heard the first night and how he thought they might have been something.  I didn't think too much about the sounds besides doing my rendition of them for my wife, brother, and sons until the night of Friday August 17th. Up until that time the main reason why I didn't pay them as much attention as I later would is that they didn't sound like the sounds available on the BFRO website. That all changed on the 17th though when I was getting ready to put a movie in the VCR and noticed that ""Encounters with the Unexplained"" on the PAX channel had a special on Sasquatch.  After watching for about three minutes, they played supposed bigfoot sounds and several of them WERE JUST LIKE THE ONES I/WE HEARD!! My wife who was in the next room unpacking heard the same sounds on the tv and noticing how similar they were to my renditions made a comment as to whether or not those were the same I heard. In that instant when I heard those sounds on TV I decided that we had heard a bigfoot and for about the next half an hour I had goosebumps going up and down my body (my wife was shocked/amused about how shaken up/freaked out I was).  On Sunday I called A.S. up (he had been away for the weekend) and questioned him more about the sounds that had originally woken him up. He said that he had first heard a long moaning like sound followed by a loud wail which was followed by the coyote and other sounds which I had also heard.  We decided that we might as well submit this report to BFRO and after talking with D.G. he also agreed.  My apologies that this is such a long story just about some bigfoot sounds and possible prints but I am still very excited about it all and thought that you might be interested due to this all happening in the area close to Skookum. ","Along the deer trail where we saw the possible prints you could tell that there had been orange plastic markers in the trees along the trail. Interestingly, all of the markers looked like they had been pulled off and were lying in the trail. I would find it odd for a ranger or hiker to go along tearing off markers and just leave them in the trail? (nt impossible though...)",Including myself there were three of us.  The sounds were heard while trying to sleep in the tent at Tillicum campsite.  And the possible prints seen while hiking down trail 21 trying to get to Skookum meadow.,Just what we heard about the recent BFRO expedition in the area from the Medved show and the BFRO website.,The sounds were heard on a very clear night (I've never seen the stars so clearly before -- benefit of getting away from the city). The possible prints were seen on a sunny day where temperatures were probably in the 80's.,The possible prints were seen on a deer trail off of trail 21. The entrance to the deer trails were located in a small meadow like area at the base of the hill after the trail from Tillicum whent down the first major hill.   We followed the deer trails across and down to Skookum meadow (we were aided by a handheld GPS system).,8/11/01

Baker in the area of Heather Meadows. About 2pm we observed a large black figure that appeared to stand erect traversing a snow field below Table Mountain. We were about a thousand feet below and were amazed at the speed the object moved. At first we thought we were watching a person but realized a human could not move at that speed up an ice field. We were mesmerized by the speed and the steepness of the terrain. At that point we knew it was not human. We found a park ranger and he suggested it might have been a bear. However, this thing stood erect the whole time, maybe 10 minutes. Joe and I kidded that we saw Big Foot but the more we think about it the more we don't think it was a bear. Too bad we didn't have our binoculars. I am a teacher in Bellingham and my husband is an accountant. Hopefully, somebody else saw this. Please let us know. Roxanne",,,,"It occured about 2pm.

53037,1090,3150,1965,Summer,July,WA,Kittitas County,,Easton,FR4908,"Craig, Jeff and Dan were camping at lake Kachess. They were 16 - 17 years old at the time and it was their next to last school-based summer vacation. One day, lost to memory, they hiked about 2 miles above the lake, off the eastern side trail and, reaching a small meadow area with a 200 foot ledge overlooking the lake, they decided to roll large 2-man boulders over the ledge, into the lake. It made quite a racket going down the hill and when they hit the water it sounded like explosives going off.  While doing this they noticed a dark upright animal with a reddish tint, standing at the meadow's forest edge, peeking out at them from behind a tree. It was between 50 and 70 yards away and slightly in shadow. It was covered in hair, kind of scruffy looking and once in awhile it would turn its body and there was a green tint to it.  They continued throwing rocks off the ledge and watching this animal for about another half hour until it got too spooky and they decided to return to their camp site.  They went back up the next day and stood in the spot the animal had been standing in. They estimated the animal as being 9 to 10 feet tall. They could only see, from the ledge the previous day, the animal from the waist up.  They all had seen bear before and were quite familar with them. This was not a bear.",They strung a rope around a branch of a tree and supported their food 6-7 feet off the ground. They also submerged their meat supply in the nearby lake.

I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip.  I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving.  The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent.  As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn't sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn't want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car.  That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl.   I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl.   What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep.  I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister's van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn't heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night.  When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same. But then again...","There was absolutely no sound anywhere in the forest when the sounds started up, which seemed odd since there was so much noise at all other times, day or night.","My husband, Larry B. and myself.",I was emailed last year by Jeff Lemley when the Skookum Meadows incident occurred.,"The sounds occurred between 3-6AM both nights.

My family and I were on our way to White Pass, Washington heading East from Tacoma.  About seven miles or so outside of Packwood heading up the pass we rounded a corner on Highway 12 and saw something covered in fur standing on the passenger side of the road at about 10pm.  Going probably 60, we passed it very fast.  Both my wife, kids, and I could not believe what we had just seen.  After waiting for a car to pass I quickly pulled a U-turn behind it and by this time had the kids screaming in the back of the van not to go back.  As we came back down we were looking out the drivers side window to were we had just seen it when the kids all screamed ""there it is.""  The car in front of us had slammed on it's brakes too, so I assume they saw it also.  It had crossed the road and was now again on the passenger side walking along the guard rail.  As we passed by it we got a pretty close look at it.  We again turned around and were heading back up but now it was gone.  I have no idea what it was other than to say it walked on two legs, was covered in brown hair.  My gut insinct tells me it was fake, but I do not know.

53067,1112,3281,1979,Spring,April,WA,Thurston County,"The incident took place at Fort Lewis, Washington in the Rainier Training.  The location is a wooded area between two unpaved roads in grid square 2401 about 2 kms north of Flander Lake.  ",In the Rainier Training area North of Rainier and West of Yelm.,South of Highway 510 between two unpaved roads at grid square 2401.,"I am prompted to submit this story after reading several months ago on this website about the incident that took place in August, 1967 in the same area.  It has taken me a couple of months to decide to submit this report, but am now convinced that it may be helpful to you:  I was an Infantry Lieutenant with the US Army in April, 1979 participating in a escape and evasion (E&E) course.  Our class was dropped off at the southern end of Weir Prairie in the South Rainier Training area late that afternoon.  The purpose was for us to break up into small teams and E&E north to the Nisqually Bridge.  We were given 24 hours to accomplish this and had to evade search teams on jeeps that were sent out to pursue and capture us.  A relatively large group (about 10 men) chose to follow myself and my Platoon sergeant (name unknown) and we proceeded north along dirt roads as far as the intersection of roads 1 km northeast of Flander Lake.  There, we started to encounter jeeps patrolling the roads. We decided to leave the road 1 km north of this intersection and walk due west cross country to another dirt road that ran north-south.  About an hour and a half into our walk we began to worry that maybe we were lost. There was much dead fall and dense brush that slowed us down. My platoon sergeant walked ahead to scout out the area while we rested.  When he did not return a half hour later I went forward to find him.  I'd walked about 100 meters when I heard noises  to my right front that sounded like heavy foot steps.  Thinking that our pursuers would not be off the road after us, I called out my sergeant's name.  A large, dark and hulking figure loomed up at the other end of a clearing about 50 feet in front of me and ran to my front for about 20 feet.  I only saw it for a moment before it disappeared into the woods.  I turned to go back to my patrol when my platoon sergeant appeared.  He asked me if that was me running around out there crashing in the bushes.  I told him ""no"", that maybe he saw and heard what I saw.  We compared notes briefly and decided it was not a deer, a bear or another human.  From his angle, he only saw a dark form running away from him into the woods. We decided to say nothing to the others and proceeded on since whatever it was, it probably wanted nothing to do with us.  We reached the other north-south road about 45 minutes later and continued to our destination without incident.  Later, at the end of course, I checked with the other E&E teams to compare routes and where they were at that time and found that the nearest team was well over two kms away.    Over a year later, just before my platoon sergeant was ready to transfer to Germany, we talked about the incident.  Both of us were hunters and outdoorsmen.  Whatever it was, we were both convinced that it was a not a deer, a bear or another animal and the way it moved through the woods, not possibly another person.  Whoever it was definitely wanted to get away from us.    I have trained in the same area off and on for quite a few years after and never saw or heard of anything similar until I read the August, 1967 report.  I have heard since that there are bear in the area, but I doubt that is what we saw that nite.

When I heard this thing from somewhere below us make some kind of scream like some man yelling for help but it was like long and drawn out and loud enough to hear this thing over the power saw running. So I looked up at my friend and said did you hear that he said yes I did. So then I shut the power saw off to listen and then maybe two min later this thing made a scream again.   I asked my friend what is that. We both thought how strange this loud sound was. Maybe five min later it screamed again. We heard this thing three times. We listened for another thirty min but never heard it again. My dad told me maybe a month before this time he had heard something screaming like a man or something that was in distress.  This was close to the same place to where we heard this thing.  There are no roads below where we heard this thing.    ,"As I have already stated, my father had heard something scream approx [one] month earl[ier] than we  did ",just me and one other guy . he was standing there waiting for me to cut the block off the cedar log ,,It was about 10:00 am.

53053,1146,3400,early 90's,Winter,January,WA,Pierce County,about 2 miles east of elbe on north side of state hwy 706 mt hwy,elbe,mt hwy,"This happened on a day outing with a good friend and hunting partner of mine. It was around 9:00 am or so that my friend called me to see if I was doing anything. I was not, he told me he wanted to go up to the mountains for the day and do something and asked if I would like to go. I did so I got my stuff ready while he was on his way over to pick me up; all I grabbed was my boots and a .22 pistol, which was also what he was bringing (a .22 pistol). Anyway, on our way from my house, since we really didn't have any set plans on where we were going, I suggested that we go up to this rancher's place that we often hunted so we could look for antler drop offs while we walked along plinking with our pistols.   We pulled up to the rancher's house but no one was home to tell we were going up on the hill, so we drove past his 400 acres to the next place, a 200 acre unoccupied place that we also had ongoing permission to hunt etc. So we began there at the east end of that place and worked our way through the woods all the way back to the first place. We decided to go ahead up the hill through this place where a trail starts and runs about 1/3 of the way up the side of the hill, the entire length of the ridge, and eventually comes out about 3 1/2 miles later on a logging road above Elbe. Our plan was to hit the logging road and walk down the road to the r/r tracks and follow them back to the truck.   We, however, realized as we plinked that about 1/2 way along this trail that we would not have enough time left before dark to make it all the way to the logging road before dark let alone all the way back to the truck from there. But we knew if we cut straight down the mountain right where we were that we would make it to the valley below before dark. So we got started down through the heavy second growth and after about 45 min of fighting our way a long ways through thick tangling ferns and underbrush, we finally came out to a small group of clear cuts on the hill above another ranch. This was bad because these people never let anyone trespass on their land.  But since we didn't have any other choice to get off the mountain before dark and since it was almost dark now we decided to go down the logging road very quietly as not to get caught on their land (this small road system is their own private operation and none of these roads go far or are connected to any other roads) to the valley below. As we quietly proceeded down this road we were half way through the last small clear-cut, it was just about dark, you could still see in the clear-cut and a long ways down the road, but not at all past the timber's edge.   We were walking side by side; I was on the left, when I saw something out of place ahead and on the left. I immediately thought that it looked like a bigfoot standing there. We were about 100 yards away on the road from being straight across from it. I hadn't said anything yet, we just kept walking, angling closer as the road came closer to its location until we were straight across from it, about 80 yards away.   The whole time I had not taken my eyes off it as we walked and I hadn't said anything yet because I thought it was going to turn out to be a stump or something (like when you see a burnt stump and it looks like a bear or something). That's when I stopped; I realized it was not a stump, I could see its arms, legs, and even some detail of it face. My friend stopped when I did. I was going to point this out to him, however when I stopped and looked at him he was already looking at it himself and said, and I quote, ""it can't be!"" We both just stood there for a minute, then my friend bends over, picks up a rock and throws it at it. He did think it must have been a stump until then. As soon as the rock landed this (and its still hard to say) bigfoot did not jump or run or seem scared at all, it just turned towards the dark timber behind it and walked into the forest.   Please note that I am an avid hunter. I have hunted and harvested many animals including bears on this very hill. I've hunted from Alaska to Montana. I've taken many bears, even some at close range with my bow. I am very aware what all the animals look like and I am 100% sure this was a bigfoot.   Before this, even with all the hunting and hiking that I have done, I never came across any tracks or other sign that I could not identify as normal forest animals, so up until this I thought that is was just a myth. Also, this is important as to the exact date, which I'm sorry I can't remember, but about a week later on our local news someone found tracks down by the river in this area. If that information could be found you would have a close date. The news said something like this: ""Bigfoot tracks found crossing the Nisqually River near Mt Rainer,"" and they showed photos of the spot but did not say exactly where, but by the size of the river in the photos they showed it looked very close to where we were.

He called to the other family members to come and see this animal and the creature turned around, looked at them with a ""disgusted"" ape face, took very long strides up the hill to the ridge and with it's left hand, grabbed a 20 foot Fir tree and shook it violently a couple of times, then went down the other side of the ridge. It looked like it had very long arms; almost reaching it's knees.  They were amazed that it could take such long strides up that hill, without the aide of pulling on trees.  The son-in-law and grandson (who is 6' 4"" tall) went up to the area where they saw this animal, to look for it or it's tracks. They came up to the tree they had seen it shake and determined the animal was bigger than the grandson. They didn't find any tracks.  The animal was about 120 yards away and the face could be seen quite clearly. The eyes were very dark but no white was seen, possibly large hairy eyebrows and the face looked like an apes and it had hair on it as well. The head looked like it had a small cone shape to it.

To make a long story short, while hiking in a very dense gorge between two mountains, we came across a nest. If you have never been to the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, let me tell you - it is DENSE! I mean, there could be a hundred Bigfoots within twenty yards of you and you wouldn't see them. Ferns and other under growth are growing anywhere from waist to shoulder length, with absolutely towering trees every few feet - truely amazing. The nest was completely conceiled, and if I hadn't walked directly in front of the opening, I never would have even noticed it. The construction was unbelievable; the under growth was woven to form a about a seven foot tunnel leading to a larger doomed inner room, about the size of a mid-sized car. The tunnel leading to the room was perfectly round and had another bush pulled towards it to conceal the entrance. We went inside to look for evidence or smell, but could find neither. While investigating inside we both looked at each other, for no reason, and both of us suddenly became very spooked. We didn't see or hear anything, just knew we had to get the hell out of there and did. We were going to go back later, but the weather went to hell and was pouring down rain. We had been trying to find some caves that are down in the gorge but never found them. I am going back in the spring to this same place where we found the nest and camp for a couple of days.

First, I must say that I am not easily taken to believing ""out there"" kinds of stories, but I feel I can explain most things in my environment while other things simply put, defy explanation.  I lived in a 22 ft. travel trailer in the woods just outside of Port Townsend, Washington at the time, which - for this report I will say roughly - was about summer 1998 or so.  It was long after dark and I  was inside writing or something and heard a strange bellowing noise just off through the woods.  It was so different than anything I'd ever heard since I moved there a year or so before that I got up and opened the door and stepped out onto the open porch.  It was a clear and still night and out in the country there it is very dark and very quiet.  I could see the stars so well.  When I heard it the second time I was immediately perplexed by what I was hearing, followed by the kind of sensation where they say ""the hairs on the back of my neck stood up"".  It sounded like a call from a large beast.  I study music technology and am well familiar with timbre, frequency, and volume and I can honestly say that the type of voice mechanism and size of it's vocal chords/chest cavity had to be at least the size of a large buck to an elk or bear.  I am also a long time, studied and experienced singer.  I do very well at imitating voices and I was struck by this bellowing as being from not only a large animal, but also an animal which must be nocturnal AND trying to communicate.  But with what or who?  So, I only heard the two bellows and after waiting a few minutes, I decided to get a flashlight and walk up the dirt road where the noise was coming from.  I didn't find anything, but I did hear other voices through the woods in the vacinity from which the noise came and I recognized them as coming from a nearby yurt, just on the other side of a small lake from me.  It was in comparison of these voices that I determined that the crys I initially heard were coming from a distance of about 100 to 150 yards.  The only other thing I should mention about the instance is that I lived on the edge of a green belt that runs, unbroken, from Port Townsend city limits, all the way into the Olympic National Park.  Furthermore, my good friend, Todd, living on the same green belt was sleeping outside one night and heard a creature of large size come lumbering up, sticks cracking and brush sweeping and all, and get very close to where he was in a tree- loft, then sat quiet for several minutes before crashing off through the brush, the way it had come.   Please understand, I have hiked the deep Olympic Mts. avidly for 12 years.  I've even worked out there at times, and I've never heard anything like the bellowing I heard that night.  And at the risk of sounding cliche or hoaky, that voicing sounded more like wookie, without the rattling throat sound that any other known sound.  But it's true also that after years of hiking and tracking in the mountains, I've never seen a bear or cougar, nor their remains and though I know they are out there, I have only but chanced to stumble upon a fresh cougar den along the Lyre River but nary a single cat in sight.  Call it what you will, I say had a sasquatch experience and some of my trusted friends can report similar strange occurances.  Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Browns and Blacks, whatever they call them out here, they're real.  And researcher Grover Crantz recently moved 35 minutes down the road from here in Sequim.  So ""something's"" up, anyway.  ",The frogs in the nearby pond got quiet at the time and the coyotes didn't howl that night.,"sorry, none.","At the end of the Quimper Peninsula is Port Townsend.

It so startled him that he threw his radio and ran back to the car, jumping up on top of the cruiser.  They didn't pursue it any further that night, and the following day, in the light, they both visited the site separately, without the other knowing and were disappointed to find that the forest floor. there, was inconducive to recieve a negative imprint from anything samller than, say, a T-Rex.  I personally checked the scene and found that this was the case.  But there has been one other strange deer-kill story from a prior park ranger that I feel is related.","Clear, calm, dark.

The night before the incident, I aimed my 2,000,000 candle power spotlight to the cliffs and caves above the camp. As usual the relatives were around the campfire till late at night (1:00 a.m.) cracking jokes and making the most racket around, long after other area camps shut off their noisy generators. Believed this attracted it's couriousity.  The relatives (3) who witnessed the sounds are very experienced outdoorsmen. One worked in the Northwest woods as a surveyor and has been chased by bears a couple of times (One time his co-worker had his pack ripped from his back as they ran) and all three know the sounds animals make. What they heard was NOT something like a Bear or Cougar! They are braver than most, not easily frightened by anyone or anything!  The night of the incident was quiet and cold . . . about 2:30 a.m. one relative went outside the tent to relieve himself. As usual, he shined his flashlight around the perimeter of the camp. As the light beam went close to the creature, it let out a VERY LOUD and LONG Volcalization as it ran through the dense timber. The noise was very intense and continious without breaking branches along the way and again 3/4 mile up the high ridge. It seemed to be mad for almost being spotted and made the sound as it ran as though it was without effort. Comparable to a kids loud car stereo turned on with the volume already up and was steady for 10 - 12 seconds. The second time up the ridge could have been from another creature but sounded like the same one. It would have easily beaten any person up the heavily timbered and steep ridge. It was defenetly NOT any known animal like a Bear bellaring as it ran or a cougar.  The noise was so loud it woke up three camps about 1/4 mile apart. The relatives left a gas lantern on until it burned out each night afterwards and they went out with a loaded gun or second person with their loaded gun. None of them will EVER sleep on the ground again!  That week of hard hunting, the 14 other hunters in the area didn't see any Elk or Deer. Also did not hear any coyotes!

53059,1233,3786,1999/2000,Summer,September,WA,Skamania County,Take Forest Road 88 north from Trout Lake approx. 15 miles.,Trout Lake,FR 88,"I am an archer/hunter who hunts elk in the Mt. Adams region of WA and I have two incidents to report; one of personal observation and one of dependable hearsay.  First, my hunting partner and I were washing in a stream on the FR88 out of Trout Lake, and we both saw a very clear footprint on the side of the stream. There were no dislodged rocks nearby, and it was not the front and rear tracks of a bear. The track was too large for black bear.   Second, my hunting partner, while hunting near the same location (by the junction of the Sawtooth Berry Fields), heard calls that ascended in pitch to make a ""whoop whoop"" sound, and then the banging of a stick against a tree, as if to signal others. He is convinced the sound was not made by a human. My hunting buddy is an FAA air traffic supervisor, and I am a salesman. We both would be able to produce witnesses to vouch for our integrity and sanity.   Sawtooth Berry Fields near the location of the sighting.

53059,1236,3800,1999,Fall,September,WA,Skamania County,"Take FR 88 north from Trout Lake, WA, about 18 miles, and then take the 8851 over to FR 30.","Trout Lake, Wa",FR 30,"J.W. and I were archery elk hunting and camped in the snow park between the Indian Heaven berry fields and Lone Butte. I had seen considerable elk activity about 1/2 mile from the meadows headed toward Lone Butte, on the north side of FR 30. J.W. killed an elk the year that this occurred so he could tell you for certain which year is was, I believe it was '98.  At the lowest spot on FR 30  is a creek bottom. That year the creek was dry as it was a very dry year. The creek bottom made an excellent travel route in and out of the woods because it is sand and large rock bottomed. I went into the area before dawn and sett up about 300-400 yards off FR 30 in the creek bottom.   Just after it was light enough to see, I heard a commotion coming from the brush alongside a well used trail that crosses the creek and enters a meadow about 200 yards from the creek. It sounded like acouple of bulls fighting and I moved as close as I could along the creek bottom. I waited for the elk to appear, then realized that the sound was stationary. I knew that I could not leave the creek bottom without making alot of noise so I waited. After about ten minutes the sound stopped.  Thinking that it must have been a bull elk tearing up a tree, I returned to camp and retrieved my tree stand. Without disturbing the area where the ""elk"" had been, I found a suitable tree a short distance from the creek bottom and placed my tree stand, I did make considerable noise sawing limbs and such but kept the disturbance to a minimum and left for lunch.  That evening I hunted another area to let my disturbance ""wear off"" but returned the next afternoon ready to sit the stand until dark. Shortly after getting into the tree the wind shifted from the NE to blowing out of the south, blowing my scent north toward Big Creek canyon. About 5:30pm I heard brush breaking behind and to my left (WNW). The animal seemed to be approaching on the trail that crossed the creek and ran almost directly beneath my stand. Abruptly the sound stopped as the animal hit my scent, I presume. At this time I was still thinking the animal was an elk and was prepared for a shot.  The next sound of brush breaking came from the north as the animal circled my position. From the sound, the animal was about 50-60 yards away, just out of sight due to the lower limbs of adjacent trees. At this point, the animal began to emit a ""whooping"" sound which started very low and smoothly rose in pitch, stopping abruptly on a high pitched note. Each of these sounds was between two and three seconds long and each was identical to the last. It made the sounds about every 20 degrees as it circled me for an arc of about 140 degrees running from NW through ENE.  I tried to believe that the sound was emitted by an elk but I have been archery hunting elk for over twenty years and have spent hours in close proximity, often close enough to hear their teeth pop, and I have never heard an elk make this sound before or since. The range was too great and the sound too loud to have been created by a human. It reminded me of Howler Monkeys only on a gargantuan scale with a much lower, deeper starting note.  Two days before this event, I found a track along a creek in a spot that was hard to access and not at all a good place to ""hoax"" a track. It was very convincing and common to the photos and molds of tracks that I have seen.  Because I had seen the track (about five miles from the tree stand) and because I happended to have been reading a book on Bigfoot encounters, I was not at all frightened by the encounter and decided to descend from my perch in order to have a better view beneath the canopy of the surrounding trees. I sat on a stump and glassed the area that I had last heard the animal but saw nothing.   I left the area with enough daylight to reach my vehicle before full dark (okay, I'm not that brave). Just before I left I noticed an apple that I had accidently dropped from my stand earlier so I collected it and another that I had in my pack and left them on the stump at the base of the tree.  I did not return to the stand until I retrieved it the day that we broke camp. The apples were gone but any animal or bird my have made off with them. I did look over the area where the tree thrashing noise came from on the first day but did not find the typical thrashed Christmas tree sized fir that an elk will work over. I believe that the thrashing I heard the first day my also have been a Yeti warning me of his presence.  I do not pretend to know for certain what made the sounds, but the tape that you e-mailed to J.W. was remarkably similar except that the call was longer and sounded calmer. Repetitions were maybe a minute apart.    The Sawtooth Berry Fields - near the location of the incident.

53015,1293,4301,2002,Spring,May,WA,Cowlitz County,Approximately 1 to 2 miles east of Hoffstead Bluffs.  Looking down into the Mt. St. Helens wash it was viewed from the highway.,"Toutle, Wa.",Mt. St. Helens Highway,"      On May 9th, 2002 at approximately 3p.m. my buddy and I were headed towards Mt. St. Helens.  We had just passed Hoffstead Bluffs heading east and I was looking down into the wash.  The Toutle splits in this area and there was a section that went between a heavily wooded area and the hillside leading to the road.  It is approximately 300 yards to the bottom.  I noticed something walking thru the creek at an angle and heading northeast.  It happened quickly and I yelled instantly to stop.  I saw it for maybe 5 seconds.  I could see the space between its strides and I knew it had to be much bigger than a man from that distance.  The arms were long and it was dark colored.  We didn't get stopped quick enough for both of us to see it.  We scanned the entire area for at least 10 to 15 minutes but saw no other movement.  I could see the area where I assume it left the woods and the ground did appear to have been disturbed.  I could not see the bottom of the hillside where I was standing.      Witness' perspective of the Toutle River during the sighting.   Photo by Jessica Stark          I know this sighting was brief but in the length of time I saw it, it did not take my mind long to decide what I was seeing.  I have always been interested in Bigfoot but it has never been something I think about regularly.  In fact, I can't remember when I thought or saw anything about it in recent years.  What amazed me was how quickly my mind told me what I was seeing.  I know from my brief observation, I will not forget that I saw something very unusual.  It could not be mistaken for any other animal or human being.ALSO NOTICED: Nothing unusualOTHER WITNESSES: Just myself.  My buddy was driving.OTHER STORIES: No I haven'tTIME AND CONDITIONS: Approximately 3 pm   The sun was out and a few clouds were present.ENVIRONMENT: Forests, wash area, creek and forest again.  Its exposure to the open was limited.

Follow-up investigation report:

BFRO Investigators Richard Noll, Alan Terry, Kevin Lindley, Jessica Stark, and Jeffrey Lemley accompanied this witness to the sighting location on May 25, 2002.  Although the witness did have a clear view of the animal as it crossed the Toutle River, the distance to the animal was roughly 1000 yards.  Misjudging this distance is understandable, as the river lies a hundred yards or so below the road, making it rough to estimate.  Of particular interest is that the witness saw the animal moving roughly in an east-northeast direction, directly towards where another sighting occurred just over 2 miles away, and only 9 days later (see Sighting Report #4359).

We got there late at night and did not have a tent so we were going to sleep in our sleeping bags right in front of my friends old VW. We had a small camp fire and it was dying down so we got in our bags and were shooting the breeze trying to doze off. All of a sudden we both were startled by alot of leaves and branches breaking all around us and a foul smell which I have never smelled before or since (I know what a skunk smells like and that wasnt it). There was a lot of screaming going on all around us like there was more than one thing out there. We grabbed our rifles and threw our bags in the car and got the heck out of there. We didn't have a flash light handy so we couldn't see a thing.,This area is always very erie.,There were two of us and we were just getting ready to go to sleep so we could get up in morning and go deer hunting.,The locals say there is a lot of weird stories from the same area much like ours.

We heard high-pitched sounds, almost like an ape, so I started to mimic the sounds. Just then, my co-worker asked me what kind of sound that was that I was making. Then, as he was up in the bucket, he said a man crossed the road. I thought he was just fooling around. As we hung more interduct, I noticed a large hairy animal which crossed the road. At first, I did not think anything of it, but this thing kept walking back and forth out to the middle of the road looking at me. I had my hand over my eyebrows trying to get a better look and to cut the glare off from the sun. This animal was not walking with a limp or bent over. To me, it walked straight up and down like a man. It was looking at me as if I had puzzled it with my impersonation. I would say it was a good 70 yards away. I tried to reason it to be a man, but all the men working in the area had hard hats on with reflective vests-us also.This thing was walking back and forth like you see a wild animal in the zoo. It did pause several times in the middle of the road to look at me, as if it had some kind of intelligence. For some reason I felt it was female. The arms were long and hung at the animal's side.

53015,1301,4353,1952-53,Summer,July,WA,Cowlitz County,,Longview,Ocean Beach Hwy./ hwy. 4,"After all these years I'm not sure just how interesting this account will be to you however it left such a lasting impression on me I have decided to submit this report.  I was born in Longview, Washington and spent much of my childhood exploring the surrounding area with my friends and family.  From camping out at Spirit Lake to spending time on my Grandparents farm.  It was on their farm that the following incident occurred.  The farm was located approximately eight miles west of Longview high on the bluffs overlooking the Columbia River near an area called Oak Point  Although not a true ""working farm"", as my Grandfather worked for the local lumber company in town,they had a large apple orchard, garden,barn and pasture.  Water was provided by a fresh water spring located about 200 yards from the house down a dark almost always moist path cut through the surrounding heavy timber.  The spring ran all the time filling a small concrete holding area which was covered by a small shed type structure open on one side.  All us Grandkids loved to walk down to the spring and sample it's cold fresh water and explore the area.  On this particular day while the rest of the family was involved with other things I decided to take a walk down to the spring.  It was a walk I shall never forget.  The first 150-175 yards of my sojourn were uneventful except that it was very quiet.  Complete silence except for my breathing and muffled footsteps.  As I neared the spring I began to pick up the smell of a skunk or what I thought was something dead.  The path made a turn to the left and went downhill just before it reached the spring.  As I made the turn the spring came within view along with what I thought was a bear drinking from it.In no time I realized this was no bear. It was a large hair covered man/ape and because I was above and to an angle of it hadn't seen me yet.  I stood very still and for some reason was not at all afraid or feel threatened.  It was squatting down with it's upper torso and head bent over the spring.  It drank for a while then raised its head and looked directly in my direction then resumed drinking having not seen me as I was still perfectly still.  I remember hearing my heart pounding and wondering if it could hear it too and give my position away.  This observation lasted perhaps 1-2 minutes when from directly behind meI heard a heeh heeh hee sound with a whistle sound at the end.  The drinking animal immediately stood up.  It was 6-61/2 feet tall, covered in dark brown to cinnamon colored hair about 3-4 inches long, dark skin on its face and hands, dark eyes set close together, flat nose, large mouth with thin lips with what I would describe an alarmed look on its face.As I turned to see what had made the noise behind me I found my self looking at two huge legs of a larger animal perhaps 8-9 feet in height.  I remember I had to look way up to see his face as he was on higher ground and besides I was just a kid.  Keep in mind that this all happened at once: the sound behind me;the drinking animal standing up; discovering another animal not 15-20 feet behind me.  TIME TO LEAVE!..........I immediately ran to my left, down hill and through the woods for about 200 feet then back up on the path.  I ran as fast as I could turning around only once to see if I was being chased.  As far as I know they didn't follow me.  I got the feeling they were as surprised as I was.     ",When I told my Grandmother what I had seen she acted very interested.  She said something to my Grandfather and he became excited.  They said I had just seen a couple of local bears that had been hanging around the farm for a while. I'm pretty sure they knew more than they were telling.,just me,No.,"Mid afternoon.....3-4 PM warm, hazy, humid","North American Rain Forest.

St. Helen's Washington,Highway 504 ,"We were driving down the highway away from Mt.St. Helens and saw a hairy being, a sasquatch,  alongside the road. It was seen by all in the car, my wife, my child and myself. It looked to covered in black hair all over it's body and was moving quickly from one group of trees across a meadow to another group of trees. It moved in a quick loping fashion with it's arms extended downward and swinging at it's side. In it's right hand it carried a club like item.  We backed up and went down a side gravel road and went up it looking for the sasquatch. After a few hundred yards we turned around and went down and tried another area but still saw nothing. We then went back to the meadow area and drove slowly up the slope of the meadow.  The meadow was surrounded by trees and was about a football field in length. We were at one end and all again saw the sasquatch at the other end of the meadow. It was turned away from us looking in the direction we had just been in and appeared to be looking to see where we had gone. I got out of the car and started approaching it quietly from behind. I got within 30 yards of it when my wife called out to me and it turned it's head.   J.K. describes his encounter to investigators.   Photo by Richard Noll  When he saw me he jerked and turned to go into the trees. I called out to it ""wait, come back"" but it gave no response. Physical Appearance is about 6 foot height. Head to feet covered in long shaggy black hair or fur. It looks like the black fur on a buffalo neck, long and matted looking. His face was covered with hair on the checks up towad the eyes. In it's right hand it carried a club about 18""-20"" long about 3 "" in diameter, with roots hanging from the end of it. I found footprints that I measured about 14 inches in length with the heel being about 4 inches wide. The stride length from the heel of one to the toe of another step was approximately 41 inches. The depth averaged 3/8 to 1/2 inch in fairly soft grassy area. My step was about 1/4 inch and I weigh about 150 lbs.

53041,1305,4380,1994?,Summer,,WA,Lewis County,"State highway 7, 5 miles toward Morton from Elbe. ",Mineral,State Highway 7,"Mineral, Washington. Lewis County.   My friend and I were sitting on his truck tailgate, parked in my parents driveway, looking at stars and laughing/talking ect...  Very clear night, with bright moonlight (rare for Washington).  Truck was about 20 feet from State Hwy 7.  A crab apple tree had grown on the edge of the property, practically hanging out in the road (Hwy 7).  The farm my family lived on was surrounded by trees, and we could constantly hear the wind run through them.  But we heard a different type of tree movement from the crab apple tree by the highway, and it caught our attention.  It sounded like something pushing the branches in, and fruit snapping off.  We got off of the truck and walked toward the tree. When we were about 15 feet from the tree, the noise stopped.  Then we saw it. A large, pale ""animal""  upright on two legs.  It paid us little mind as it jogged out from behind the tree, and loped across the highway with a ""swish, swish, swish"" sound from it's feet.  It sounded like someone rubbing two pieces of sand paper together.  I was transfixed by the legs.  They remained so strait, and took such long strides.  The left arm swung in huge, deliberate strokes, and other than the feet swishing, we heard no noise.  No labored breathing, creeky joints, Nothing.  The visual  portion was as follows:   Pale colored.  Not brown at all. Infact, almost a ""dirty white"" color.   Long, slender limbs. Not fat or ""bulky"".   Hair on legs seemed to be around 5 or 6 inches long, and swung back and forth with leg motion.   Definitely had a ""hand"", which swung in large, forceful movements. It was hanging onto what I believe to be my parents crab apple.   We were unable to move for what seemed like hours, but must have been only a few seconds. It continued down the highway, and when we came to our heads, in nervous excitement we ran for the truck cab to turn on the headlights.  Too late, it was out of site.  We ran inside, grabbed flashlights, and after trying to explain to my family what had just happened, ended up dragging half of them out into the woods in the ""animals"" last known direction of travel. Needless to say, we heard and found nothing.   The next day, tracks could be found, although they were not the type you would expect.  They were scuffs of tracks from the animal dragging its feet, not the clear, easily identifiable tracks you see on TV, etc...The crab apple tree had a signifigent section of broken branches, and two pieces of apple laying on the ground.

53073,1307,4392,1982,Summer,July,WA,Whatcom County,This actually occured at Baker Lake Resort. Along the creek at the North end of the area.,Concrete,Baker Lake Road,"My wife, daughter and I were camping at Baker Lake . It was night, the generator and campfire were out. It is very dark, cant see your hand in front of your face.  We were sleeping, when I was awakened by heavy footsteps walking by the tent. The footsteps continued towards the picnic table and stopped.  I heard the clanking of silverware, very slight however.  Soon thereafter the footsteps walked out the other end of the campsite. Definetly was a bipedal creature. Very heavy footsteps, that were rapid.  It walked with a purpose.It was so dark and so heavily wooded that I'm still amazed at how quikly it moved.  I had an opportunity to unzip the tent and grab the flashlight when it paused at the picnic table, but the heavy footsteps,the pitch dark, 3year old daughter whom I was thinking about how to protect if necessary, made me pause with fear.  I'm absolutley convinced that I heard Bigfoot.  I searched in the AM for tracks, but the summer was dry. No soft ground, mud or anything.","Other items I think are revelent to why I firmly believe this was Bigfoot.  The footsteps that I heard crossed a large gravel area. This gravel had ruff/jagged edges. When I retraced the path the next morning, I was wearing sneakers. As I walked on the gravel, it made the walking on gravel sound that you would expect to hear if a person were wearing shoes. The noise I heard had no such sound, as if no shoes were being worn.  I took my shoes off and attempted to walk on the gravel. No way! Even with ""summer feet"" I could not walk with my barefeet on that gravel.  Our friends who were with us had a small dog with them. The dog never barked....   The speed at which the footsteps moved, with no flashlight to guide the way in the pitch dark, accross the gravel further strenghtens my belief at what I heard.","Yes, she heard it.

A group of 75 kids age 7 to 17 and the camp personel.  From a huge pasture area all the campers walked down a trail that was thick with blackberry bushes and was lightly treed with alder, etc.  The trail was about 200 yards long.  At the end of the trail, there was a circular clearing about 150 feet in diameter.  This is where the group set up camp.  There were 3 trails out of the clearing.  The one going to the pasture, one going to the river (over a little rise and about 100 feet away from the clearing) and one trail that deadended 50 feet up.  This is where the campers were to relieve themselves.  A group of 4 twelve year old girls were going to relieve themselves down this trail at about 11pm.  From deep in the berry bushes, we heard something moving.  It sounded like the animal would move a little ways, then stop.  We could hear branches and twigs snapping.  We couldn't figure out what it could be because it was such a thicket of berries.  No human could be in there without getting massively scratched.  We listened for quite awhile and noticed whatever it was was moving closer to us, but it was still a ways away.  Getting scared, we ran back to our sleeping bags.  There was a big circle of girls in their sleeping bags and our group of 5 was off to the side, near the ""bathroom"" trail.  I listened for a long time from my sleeping bag & noticed the animal was getting closer.  I got up from my friends & moved into the center of the circle of girls!  I fell fast asleep.  One of my best friends did not.  What Jane heard as she lay awake was whatever it was, eventually came out of from the berry bushes.  There were 2 of them.  They communicated by making soft cooing noises to each other that sounded very much like pigeons.  Jane was laying on her stomach in a goosedown sleeping bag with her head on her arms & was petrified.  She could not look up at what was in our camp because she was afraid of what she might see.  She said the two creatures moved all around our camp.  If someone stirred in their sleeping bag, they would stop moving & make no noise.  She could hear them get in our boxes of food.  They continued exploring our camp for hours, intermittantly calling softly to each other.  All the while she is stiff as a board in her sleeping bag.  Then to top it all off, one of them steps on the end of her sleeping bag & she feels the whoosh of the air coming up to her feet.  She moved her feet.  Whatever it was reached down and lightly touched her back!  She - even MORE petrified, just layed there, hoping it wouldn't hurt her or carry her away!  I woke at dawn from the center of the big circle of girls & got up to go relieve myself.  Jane was laying in her bag exactly as I described.  She hadn't moved & the down bag was literally soaking wet with her sweat.  I believe she was in mild shock.  She dull-ly told us what happened to her, but she was so wrung out, there was little emotion she showed.  My friends and I walked all over looking for some sign of what she said happened but since the ground was dry, there weren't any distinguishable footprints.  Later when we got back to the Aqua Barn, Jane layed in bed the rest of the day to recover.  Our group, to this day, calls this incident ""The thing that came to camp!""  Since I was not greatly affected by this, it's fun for me to recall.  Jane and I talked about this incident in 1990 and she IS NOT happy to relate it!  She literally started sweating and got a little shaky as we talked about it. ",I don't remember finding anything.,Jane was directly involved!  Two other girls and me.,"Sometime before (I'm not sure how long), the PI reported a bigfoot sighting on the side of the road of the Maple Valley Highway, right by the golf course, just outside of Renton.  The man saw something big and hairy laying on the side of the road at night.  When he shined his headlights on it, it got up and moved away.","First heard them at 11pm A clear night, dry outside, no lights anywhere nearby","It had not rained for a long time.  The clearing where we camped was grassy.  The woods where the animals came out of was deciduous cottonwood, alder and maple.  Very much overgrown with blackberry bushes.",

I found a Huckleberry Creek in my atlas (National Georaphic,1999) in the northern part of Mt Ranier National Park. If I had a more detailed map, I could probably locate it-and possibly the actal location of the incident.",Greenwater,Route 410,"While stationed at Fort Lewis (15th Engineer Battalion, A Company), I received mountain training at the Huckleberry Creek facility. The final exercise was called the Alpine Scramble, a ""Point A to Point B"" land navigation problem with problems to solve along the way. While on the exercise, my squad stopped at a stream to rest and eat. There was a sand/gravel bar going out into the stream. We noticed large imprints on the bar, and subsequently found several large footprints in the soft soil by the stream. They were not very long (compared to some reports)-14 inches-but very wide-about 7 1/2 inches. They were also pressed quite deeply into the soil, while we had to really stomp to make any kind of real imprint. There was about a four to four and a half foot stride between footprints (we had a tape measure). As we were on a tight schedule, we did not spend a whole lot of time examining the prints-perhaps ten minutes (our squad leader was convinced they were a joke put on by our instructors). As we made our way down the stream, we saw an occasional print or mark for a short ways, then they stopped. Whether they went into the forest or into the stream-I don't know-I am not a tracker. Nor could I tell you how fresh the prints were.  An interesting footnote-when we returned to or base camp and were doing an after-action debriefing, I spoke to our squad's instructor about this (our squad leader objected strongly, but a few of the other members were interested); he strongly advised us to forget about it and not mention anything. So we did. However, it did raise my interest in the matter, and I have been reading and researching Bigfoot since then (the other squad members may have talked about it-I didn't and went ETS not long after).","No. I also did not feel watched, or smell anything, or any of the other reactions commonly described.","Six, including myself.","No. I have looked in books and websites,but I have ben unsuccessful.","Mid-afternoon(between two and four, probably).Overcast (I believe it rained later).","Typical Pacific Northwest woods-lots of trees, sprarser near the stream.

I had gone hiking in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area in Washington. The trailhead is at the end of the West Fork Foss River road. The snow had remained for several weeks longer than normal, and I had to use the ice axe in a couple of places to reach Copper Lake.  I stayed there only long enough to boil some water for tea, and then took the trail back down to Trout Lake and on to the trailhead. I got in the car and started back down toward US Highway 2. I had gone about a half-mile, and on rounding a bend in the road, I saw a tall, dark creature cross the road about 50 yards in front of me. I judged it to be about 8 feet tall, and it was definitely of a humanlike body shape. I have often observed bears, and this was no bear!  Bears do not cross a road on their hind legs, although they may rear up at times. I never got a look at the face, as it was turned away from me. After crossing the road, it went up a bank that was so steep no human could have climbed it without traveling on all fours, and it remained upright. This was a creature such as I had never seen before, not since.",,I was alone.,,It was early afternoon (maybe 2:00) bright sun and warm (70's).,"Open road, brushy on both sides, steep bank below road, same above, with small trees intermixed.",14

The USGS map of about 1952 labeled the road as Rock Creek Road and it intersected the Tower Road just about 150 yards NE of Hollywood Gorge. I remember the year because John had been graduated from high school and was working at Longview Logging and Mill Supply and I was about to enter my junior year of high school. Anyway, it was summer and we were camping in my father's old army pup tent when we heard what sounded like several apes screaming. We both agreed that was the best description of the sound. It was fairly dark and we looked out of the tent and saw a large dark silhouette about 150 feet from the front of the tent. John had a JC Higgins single shot 22 rifle and I had a Winchester gallery gun also in 22 cal. What we saw we thought was a big foot and we shouted out several warnings to whoever or whatever was there that we were going to begin shooting. After getting no response, we pumped several rounds into it and it did not move. We finally got brave enough to go out and investigate only to learn it was an old tree stump from when the area was logged by McCormick Brothers in the late 1800s or early 1900s.  Although the stump was not a big foot, we both heard that most chilling screaming which must have lasted 45 seconds to a minute. My best guess is that the sound originated less than 300 yards away, yet the nearest farm or house or cabin was about 1-2 miles away.

All of a sudden, less than 100 yards away, we noticed an entirely black upright creature. Even though we're driving a noisy Cummins Diesel , when we came around the corner, going about 15 mph,  we managed to startle it. It immediately walked fast - didn't run - from the right to the left, up a hill and was gone. Now this whole event didn't take more than 3-4 seconds. We immediately went to the area, and investigated. We found one print that was about 12-13 inches long on the side of the road. This print was made in the somewhat soft silt/gravel that is so common on forest service roads. It only was about 1/4-1/3 deep at best.  Today we're going to try and make a copy of the print.  A couple of things about the animal.  1.  It was totally black, like a black bear. It had no facial features that we could detect at all. It didn't appear to have a nose, eyes, mouth or anything, that we could see from the 100 yards we were away.  2.  The animal was in bright sunlight as it crossed the road - there was no mistaking it for a bear - and bears don't have 6 ft strides.  3. The animal appeared to be about 8-8.5 feet tall and slender build. It wasn't the massive muscular specimen I have thought they may be if they exist at all. I would estimate the weight in excess of 400 lbs.  4.  The animal's arms moved in a pedulum manner, like an ape - not like a human.  It moved very fast - BUT NOT a RUN!

We parked a gate on forest service road 2560 looking to the east. ------------------------------------------ The location of the print  that I casted was about 1/2 mile down the road at the Miners Car (parking lot) near a stream from Meta Lake along the streambed of Clearwater Creek.   I walked across the road and into the blast zone along the creek. I found the track along a game trail near a broken pine tree. I was off any type of established human trail in the restricted blast area.,Randle,Windy Ridge Rd.,"It was a family outing. My uncle and my two brothers and I went up to Mt. St. Helens to look for Bigfoot.  My uncle saw a print back in the 60's and has been talking about it all my life. He is getting older now and this was our first trip to go and look as a group.  He has studied Sasquatch for the last 30 years.   We drove up Windy Ridge RD from the town Randle all the way to the top overlooking Spirit Lake , The weather was really bad it was raining and sleeting on and off and very foggy and windy.  The parking lot at the top was covered in a inch of slush.  The view was obscured  by a large cloud(like looking into a fog bank).  We started driving back down the mountain below the level of the clouds and we stopped at the Cascade Mtn. viewpoint where there is a modular building and a Forest Service Road(2560) with a locked gate.   I stopped the car and was mounting  a lens on my camera ; my brothers got out of the car to strech their legs and scan the hills ; my uncle was in the back seat of the car with a spotting scope looking down into meadow to the northeast.  My little brother got out of the car and went to the edge of the valley and let out a ""HELLO!"" I told him to shut up and not to do that again.  But then from the backseat my uncle said that the scream from my brother had spooked something  down in the meadow and it was bolting around a hill in the middle of valley going from left to right and out of sight around a small hill about 400 yds. away he discribed it as large, black and walking upright.  My uncle was too scared to get out of the car, he said  ""us"" brothers should ""go and have a look"" up the road to see if we could get a better vantage point. The three of us proceeded to walk up the gated road ( FSRD 2560) leading up a ridge with some smaller knolls that ring the meadow.  It took us the most of 25 minutes up and down  the road and ten minutes scanning the meadow. My brothers and I didn't see it walking off from the vantage point where we where.  So we headed  back to the car.  My Uncle Mac was in the car the whole time watching the area where he had spotted it the first time when we left up the road.  He said that after the three of us rounded the hill and where out of sight the large sasquatch walked back into his view left to right and proceeded back to where it was before, walking by a small black stump when that stump then stood up and walked off with it leading what must have been young in the opposite direction the three of us where going. He said he lost sight of it as they walked north down deeper into Bear Meadow.   We all loaded into the car and drove a little down the mountain ( 1/2 miles) to the Miner's Car at a parking lot that is near the southern side of Bismark Mtn.  Clearwater Creek runs out of Meta Lake and under Windy River Rd. and into Bear Meadow at the Miner's Car.  My uncle and my brothers spread out along the road to see if they could tell where these things where crossing the road.  I walked down the creekbed from the road into a slight gulley and followed it for about 100 yrds on the left side staying near the lowest point  along a game trail when I came up on a broken tree that had been broken for at least a year( Brown needles at the top).  I found a large humanoid footprint on a slope next to the tree. The toes where very noticable (no claws) and where imprinted in mud.  I went back to the car to get plaster and the consultation of my older brother who went to WSU and studied under Dr. Krantz.  I showed him the print before we poured the cast,  he agreed with me that it must be a bigfoot print .  I reminded him that we where in the blast area and no one normally walks in this restricted area on the side of a volcano barefoot .   It was really cold and raining so we gathered half shells of bark and covered the cast so it would set up overnight .  I went back the next day and retrieved the cast.

Near a bigger river.,,20,"Hi there, i don`t know if this is of any intrest or help to you but i just wanted to tell it anyway.  I´m a 23 year old german/american who just came back visiting my uncle in Spokane, WA. I live in Stuttgart, Germany. On August 2nd i visited my cousin who lives in Bellingham, WA. My partner on this trip was my uncles American-Staffordshire ""Kane"". We had a nice weekend in Bellingham and so on.  We drove back on August 4th at about 7-7:30PM. We took Interstate 5 and then Highway 20 cause i wanted to drive through Skagit Valley and the N.Cascade NP. At about 9PM i had to loosen my water(hopefully u know what i mean). We were just about by a River of which i don`t exactly know the name. I pulled over to the side and what happened then has changed my thinking of the world a lot.  I got out of the car looking for relief and all of a sudden ""Kane"" started growling like i never heard him before(the window on his side was rolled down a little). It was almost dark so i looked over around but couldn`t see anything, so i thought maybe a deer or something. I went on with my buisness and then ""Kane"" totally flipped out(Barking and everything), so i looked around and saw something real big jumping over the streets with like 2 steps and then vanishing in the woods(It was about 30yards away).  Since i`m a courageus youngster from a relative big city(Stuttgart has about 700000) i decided to check it out. So i got ""Kane"" on the leash and we walked to that position and after about 20yards the dog stopped, pressing out all his muscle and started growling.  I tried to pull him with me but he wouldn`t move a inch. I had a little flashlight with and pointed towards the woods but couldn`t see anything. Then i realized this awful smell(smelled like ferrets but much more intense). The dog then started backing up and i thought it was time to get outta here! We were back at the car when all of a sudden the bushes and trees behind us started cracking and bursting towards us. We got in the car and hit the gas.  The reason i´m writing you is this:  I´m not supersticous at all, Am.-Staff`s are courageus dogs and i never seen a probably 6`5"" man running across a street vanishing in the woods in my life!

I noticed at once that there was a ""man"" watching me from about halfway up the hill side. I thought to myself ""geez, that guy is huge"" then it began to walk up the hillside with these huge strides and effotlessly stepping over logs and swinging its' arms with a most peculular motion. Its' color was a brownish grey. I thought to myself, It's a sasquatch! I watched it for about 2 minutes as it worked its' way up the hill and into the tree line.

They both spotted it and it was walking away from us at a 45* angle looking back over its left shoulder.  It went behind a big stump and we didn't see it for several seconds.  It came out from the other side and stood facing us and just looked at us for probably 30 seconds.  At this point we all got serious because we could tell that it didn't appear to be a human and I know it was not a bear.  It turned and started walking away from us looking back ever so often.  It stopped just before going down a little raven and stood looking at us again.  It went down in the ravene and up the other side then disappeared into the timber.

We went out past Roslyn from Cle Elum toward Salmon La Sac and the Wenatchee National Forest.  There were many small dirt roads off Salmon La Sac road leading down to the resevoir on the left.  We decided to camp down one of these small road between the resevoir and the main road.  It was not a campground, but had some decent places for tents and had been used by campers before as evidenced by a fire ring.  There was another tent camper a few hundred yards away.  The weather was poor.  It began raining on the trip up and kept raining and drizzling off and on the entire time we were out there.  After unpacking all our gear and getting camp set up we began to notice medium sized rocks (golf ball to baseball sized) flying into our camp.  At first we thought it may have been one of the kids goofing around, but after an hour or so we had accounted for all the kids and the rocks kept up.  We continued to have rock thrown into our camp until the next morning.  In addition, roughly ten times during the night we heard very loud screams coming from further down our side of the resevoir.

I was hunting uphill, going slow, and angling away from the creek. I was finding lots of deer sign and it looked like a promising day.  I went about 100 yards before seeing a small buck bedded and jumping some does up. I walked on for 45 or more minutes. The deer sign quit except for a couple old tracks.  I was standing quietly to plan my direction when I heard what sounded like logs or poles being thrown onto a pile of more poles. I heard this sound three different times in a row,  just a few minutes apart. There were no hunters or other people in this remote area.  Walking further up the hill I saw a draw coming up. Looking around for my best entrance, I see a White Fir tree approx. 24 "" on base with an oval piece of bark missing. I figured it must have been done by bear or buck deer. I walked down to it to discover only one gouge on the bark above scar. It obviously wasn't done by a bear or deer. It appeared to be pulled off gently and exact. The top was eye level to me, and the bottom was about 10""-12"" above ground. there was only one small piece of bark on the ground about 4"" wide and 12"" long also shaped in a perfect oval. The sap on tree was untouched.  I turned and walked to the edge of the draw. Looking down only 12 feet or so at the bottom, was what appeared to be a large deer bed. When I got down to it, it was an area the size of three dinner tables. It was covered in fir and pine needles and obviously well packed.  Standing there I could hear water running. Looking down into a hole on the downhill edge of this, was a short under ground creek exposed. The hole was approx. 4 feet long, 12 in wide, and 20-24 inches deep, with a flow of water at the bottom. I glanced up the draw. It was steep and covered with nothing but fir needles and old rotten logs. The same below but not as steep.  The next thing I noticed really got my attention. Water had recently been splashed up and over one side of the hole onto the dry fir needles. Feeling uneasy, I walked up and out of the other side of the draw on a well worn, well packed path covered in fir and pine needles.  The area has a lot of little bushes which resemble a miniature huckleberry, the plant no taller than 6"" high. These on the edges of the path were also smashed down flat. There was no sign of bear tracks in area.  At the upper crest of the path  I studied a track, human like but with no signs of toes. It was about the length of my boot (I wear a size 12). Where the ball of the human foot is straight across, this seemed to bump up in the middle but no sign of toes. (Meaning that the whole size of this foot had to have been much larger than that of any humans). The ground was hard and had some needles on it.  Looking up ahead I saw Willow bushes in an opening in the timber. I was trying to decide whether to go up or below it when I noticed what seemed to be stacked dead logs inside of what appeared to be a circle of Willow bushes approx. 60 feet in diameter. Planning to walk closer to get a better look, I almost step on feces that I have never seen before. (I have been an avid hunter and hiker for many years and have NEVER seen the looks of this before). It was a weird textue and color and looked more human than bear or cougar. I decided to take a picture with my disposable camera I had in my backpack.  As I was taking my pack off, I glanced downhill and caught a glimpse of what looked to be some brown fur quickly ducking down behind a buckskin log. I didnt get a good look so I thought it could have just been a squirrel since the area was full of them, but it was too large, and also, the last thing you see of a squirrel is its tail and not a patch of fur. I began to get very uncomfortable.  I pulled out my camera from my pack and knelt down and took a picture of the feces. Wanting to be sure it worked, I decided I should take another one. I then got the idea that after I took the second picture, I would empty a ziploc bag I had in my pack containing my trail snacks and take a feces sample back with me to turn into someone for some further investigation on it.  I knelt even closer to get my second picture, started to wind the camera and all of a sudden from behind me I hear a sound I cant even really describe. You had to be there to hear it yourself to get any sense of just how this thing sounded.  It was a ""whuuuuuuuuu""  sound. A kind of a roar like, yell like sound. It was very low and lungy and louder in decibals than any human, even one shouting as loud as he could right in my ear. It had to have come from something with a very large set of lungs. It was a very threatening, warning type of sound accompanied by a large crash like that of a log being thrown through large bushes. Looking up and behind me, all I saw was two squirrels running panickedly down the hill through the draw and up a fir tree not more than 10 feet in front of me.  I decided I was OUT OF THERE, shoving my camera in my pack. I looked up to the squirrels sitting on the lower branches. They were looking in the direction the noise came from and making a lot of racket. I think I may have even said outloud ""OK I'M LEAVING"" as I got my pack onto my back. Not thrilled about having to go back in the direction of the noise, I unsnapped my 44 mag. handgun in my holster.  I was trying to leave lower toward the creek than I had come. As I passed by the draw I looked below to see the tree with the bark missing, so I headed even more down hill. I could faintly hear Silver creek below me maybe a 1/4 mile or so away.  Inititally trying to be quiet, I felt it best to make all the noise I could. So I stepped on every dead limb and branch I could. Going around a tree, I almost stepped on some more feces. It was the same color, gray and tan with some white specs throughout, but this was much larger and more of a constipated texture. It had kind of a pink or champagne tint to it. I thought about stopping to retrieve a sample but I wasnt about to stop and kneel down again.  For the first 200 yards or so, I could hear something purposefully making loud noise (Stuff crashing around and what sounded to be large things being tossed and thrown) it stayed just out of my sight below and behind me. Then as I neared the road, it all appeared to just stop and I felt I was left alone.  As I finished my desent out ,and for the rest of the day, all I could think about was that sound. How loud and breathy it sounded. A person standing right behind me couldnt be even half that loud. It sounded like the exact same sound my son and daughter's boyfriend had described to me last November  while hunting In the late buck season. They had something answer the grunt tube call they were using not more than a mile from the same spot.",Son and daughter's boyfriend heard same type of noise while hunting the previous year not more than a mile from where I was. It answered their grunt call they were using. It unsettled them so bad they decided to leave the area and not continue with their calling.,No,,Early morning (around 8 am) weather was clear and sun was just coming out.,Also described above,17th

I didn't actually see anything, but having climbed up there to get a view, I was warned in no uncertain terms -- a grunting hum with a stamping of feet.  The Beast inhaled and exhaled with a sound like a large bull.  The animal must have enomous girth, given the sound.  And then total silence.  I altered by approach to the water fall's edge.  I waited, no sounds, no nothing.  I wasn't going in those woods, however.  I thought it might be a rogue bull, but given what I've heard about how BigFoot is, how he sounds, the rocky hard-to-get-to area, and the very dense vegatation.  It might be a BigFoot residence.  It's probably worth a look.  ",,,,Early afternoon,,

There were about 10 kids and 4 adults leaders. We hiked up the Dosewallips River headwaters to the Royal Basin where there are a couple of small lakes. We made camp and eat dinner then went to bed. The adults stayed near the campfire area. One group slep under a large rock overhang. I chose to sleep a little away from all their noise of the others.  I remember looking up at the stars and the jagged mountains. After a while I looked up again and saw that the mountains appeared smooth! I was thinking, how could this be, when the ""smooth"" mountain started to sway a little. I smelled a definite skunk cabbage smell. I then realized that this was not the mountain but the silouette of a large animal. I was seeing its head and shoulders as it was standing at the foot of my sleeping bag. I pulled the sleeping bag up over my head. Later I looked out and it was gone. The mountain was back to its normal jagged shape. Then the group down by the overhang rock started yelling. ""Whats that over there?"" ""It looks like a big gorilla!"" ""Look you can see it, its moving!"" The adults were upset at all the talking and screaming. I heard each of the adults in turn saying to knock it off and get back to sleep! Not one of the adults could have been pulling a prank. They were all off to the lake side as I could hear. The next morning there was a lot of talk of what they saw the night before. The adults thought the older kids were just trying to scare the younger ones. I think they were telling the truth.",It was in the spring time as there was still snow in the shadows.

Approx. 8:30am I was slowly working my way down the frozen dirt rd watching for any movement when about 300 yds down the road my eye caught a movement. It was black & coming toward me. At first glance I thought it was a bear but as I watched it I could see it was walking upright so I assumed it was a man.& I thought ""What the hell is this idiot doing up here in the middle of nowhere during deer hunting season dressed like that without a stitch of blaze orange on..God, he's even wearing a black stocking cap He's just begging to get shot. It kept walking towards me and I was taking small quiet baby steps toward it. All I could see that wasn't black was a kind of round lighter gray area where its face was.

No, but I had no explination of what it was I was seeing.   As I slowed down, the animal which was standing on two legs steped over the guard rail and turned to start walking up the hill.

53039,1499,5495,1993,Summer,August,WA,Klickitat County,I know exactly how to get there but I don't remember the Hwy leading W out of Goldendale but stay on it then you come up to block house. Drive through and keep following the hwy for about 4 miles you come to a sharp 20 mile corner and instead of taking the corner go straight off the road.  It becomes gravel road.  Follow it for about 5 miles then you should come to an old run down homestead off to your left that open field is where this took place ...This is known as the Grayback mountain range  leading up to Mt Adams,Goldendale,Hwy leading west out of Goldendale,"I have always known about these creatures but, never really gave it much thought til it happened to me. I was working for a local rancher in Klickitat Co, just NW of Goldendale WA. My boss said that there had been cattle getting out in this pasture land he rented from someone, we keep cattle out there during the summer, and was to feed out everyday at least twice a day, this pasture land was about 5 miles , NW of a once town called Block House . Well he sent me out there to investigate and check the fencing, and find out where they were getting out . So I hop into my truck stretchers in hand and more barbed wire to fix the fence. Once I had reached this pasture land I stepped out of my truck and noticed a strange smell, smelled like someone had just shit them selves .I didn't give it much notice and started walking fence line heading W. I stopped for a cig and something didn't feel right , like someone or something was watching me. I got up and started N on the fence line got half way through checking the N side fence when I saw why the cattle was getting out. There had been a tree thrown through the fence and was down.This tree was about 14 -15 inches in diameter laying where the fence used to be. I thought this was odd, and upon futher noticing, there was a brownish reddish hair on the barbed wire. I have been around cattle all my life and never seen this before, the hair smelled awful. So I finally got the tree moved but was no small chore, it was heavy ever than hell to lift but being 6'6'' 240 lbs I was in good shape .But still it was hard for me move it, but eventually I got it moved. All the time I felt like I was being watched from afar. I didn't like the feeling I was getting, so I quicky mended the fence and finshed checking the fence line on the N side, then turned back to the E, and came down to a small creek and noticed these huge footprints in the still wet mud. They looked fresh like an hour or two old, but the size of these were bigger than mine I wear a size 12 to 13, and placed my foot next to the footprint in the mud, and it was so much bigger than mine . I knew that this wasn't normal cause the left foot where the big toe is looked like it was being dragged . Well this isn't a poss, I thought theres no way a human could make this print it was about a size 19 or 20. I was saying, to myself that I know Shaq hadn't been here cause he's the only human that wears a size 22 triple E so I knew something not human made this. At this time I heard a grunt coming from where I had just been fixing the fence and it had scared me. I walked fast, and I mean nothing short of running flat out back to my truck which was parked about 2 miles away.I got back to my truck and noticed that tools , like shovel, and plastic gas can and empty soda cans thrown out of my truck bed like someone was looking for something or helping me clean out my truck bed. I picked everything up threw it all back in the bed of the truck, and just as I was getting ready to get in, I heard this high piched scream coming from where I had just been so that was it, I was gone. I never heard anything like that in my life. As I was driving back down the road, I thought please don't let that fence break again ,cause I didnt want to have to come back here unless someone was with me. That was the last time I ever went out there. A few weeks later I changed my job and enlisted in the U.S.ARMY, but that day will stick with me forever. People dont believe until it happens to them.  Well, that day made a believer out of me that there's something out there, and if it doesn't want to be found, you're not going to find it,    it finds you .

It had been dark for a couple hours and had been raining all day. I was wood working on my front porch. Several houses exist in the woods around me, but the properties are large and wooded, and civilization only diminishes as you head South. Our neighbors live about 20 yards East of us, and ten yards beyond their house are old growth cedars, maples, and firs. They weren't home at the time. I was in the middle of using my cordless drill, when I heard this call come from the woods. I instantly stopped drilling and listened. The first thing I thought was ""That's loud!"". It started in a low moan-like sound and climbed to almost a scream. The sound lasted steadily for three seconds, then was followed by two to three short whooping sounds. At that point I was severely freaked and was already heading inside. I only report it because it seems consistent with other reports I've read. Two days later, I down-loaded a Bigfoot scream, and the hair stood up on the back of my neck when I played it. That is what I heard.","Thinking about it later, the electric drill was vibrating wood very severely, which I was holding down against a wooden table, on a wooden porch.

53073,1540,5771,1972,Summer,August,WA,Whatcom County,"Heading South on Highway 9 from the intersection of Highway 9 and the Mt Baker Highway, past Van Zandt about 5 miles to the Strand Road. Turn right on the Strand Road, going about 3/4 mile until it dead ends at the South Fork of the Nooksack River.","Van Zandt,  Washington","Strand Road, off Highway 9","This was a long time ago. In the summer of 1972. My cousin and I were spending a weekend fishing on the South Fork of the Nooksack River. The exact location was at the end of the Strand Road off of Highway 9 between Sedro Wooley and the Mt Baker Highway.   We were both going into the 8th grade. Our parents dropped us off on a Friday and would pick us up Sunday. Crazy werent they!  We set up camp fairly close to the end of the road, about 50 feet from the river. We spent Friday afternoon fishing and came back to our camp and built a fire. Finally we went to bed. We both stuck our pocket knives in the sand next to us in case we needed them at night.   I was startled awake in the middle of the night by a sound and as I awoke sleeping in my sleeping bag saw the silhouette of something on the other side of a small fence, and slightly above us. It was about 20 feet away. There was a full moon behind which created a perfect silhouette image.  This creature made a series of long hissing type sounds. The best discription is a hissssssssssss. Then it would stop for a bit and do it again. It did this 5-6 times.   The silhouette was from about the waist up, it was broad shouldared with no neck. It had a sloping forehead and not noticable ears that I could detect. It rocked slightly from side to side as if it was smelling us or trying to see us laying there a bit better. It could not have gotten right us without going through this fence and under some small branches. It appeared that it was likely crouching down maybe on one knee.  I was obviously petrified. It was there for probaly 3-5 minutes. When it left it kind of pivoted its entire body to its right and was gone.   I would estimate this to be about 3 in the morning. I heard nothing as it walked away. I layed there for the rest of the night frozen stiff with fright, to the point that my body began cramping up!  I did not hear anything as it left, nor smelled anything. I did hear shortly after it left, from the direction of the river and sounding like across the river a series of clicks with what sounded like rocks being hit togethor very rapidly. They were hit togethor 3-5 times very fast. I heard this a few times firt fairly close, then farther off as if going away from us.  My cousin did not hear a thing.. sleeping away. We stayed there the following night without incident. although with a big fire going and fishing line tied to each others wrist, should we need to wake each other!  In the morning I told my cousin and we looked for tracks, but did not see anything. The field that this thing was on was hard packed and it was very hard and dry, so no indentations.  I know what I saw! It was not a man nor a bear, nor someone trying to scare us making a growling sound or something.. None of that!

My cousin and I called the guy who actually took us to the Strand Road location where we showed him exactly where my sighting was. We found no evidence. Again it was a few months later.

We were walking down the road it was a little soft from the night before rain and dense low fog.W e were loking for sign when we encountered the tracks right on top of where are tires had just rolled something had followed our vehicle.At first we thought it was a big bear immediately we were on alert.As we examined the tracks more closely we determined that bears dont walk on their hind feet for this long of a period of time.There was no front paw tracks!We continued on our drive encircleing the area.On our way thru the thick buckbrush heading west back to the truck we started hearing noises,something was now tracking us.We could smell a strong oder that was like cat urine or a dirty cat box.At this point we were both scared we could hear it smell it but we could not see it.The visibility in this brush was near 5ft.in most places besides the trail we were on where you could see 20ft to the front or rear of you.We started to move faster for the truck as we sped up so did it.The brush behind us was cracking so we took cover behind 2 trees each of us on the oposite side of each other aiming to where the noise was.At this time whatever it was squealed in a high pitch(almost like a woman giving birth)and took off running n.w. of our position.Hoping it was gone and fearing it was heading for mom we scrambled that way.When we got to the truck she was in it with the doors locked.She told us it was N. of her position making lots of noise(thrashing).We went to investigate,we found more tracks and trees about 4inches in diameter were uprooted and thrown down the gullyside,there was no sign of it.We met up with my uncle and cousin and showed them the tracks they could not beleive it.We went back to our uncles camp for lunch when we got there we noticed more tracks it had come into the camp.My cousin is a big guy his shoe size is a 15,these tracks had more than 3-4 inches on him whatever this thing was it is BIG!! I dont tell to many people about this for fear of being laughed at or called crazy but for the 7 of us we will never forget.",found some greyish/black hair on a old barb wire fence where the tracks left uncles camp. Also there was no signs of deer or other wildlife which was not normal for the area.,there was seven of us we were hunting.,"When we asked a old hermit that lived here,if he had ever seen anything weird out here he just smiled.We used to give him yakima apples in trade for hunting his land.","early morning,very foggy after a good rain.Dense woods and brush.","pine forest area with scub oak and buckbrush,rolling hills and gullys.",14
53009,1561,6058,2000,Fall,October,WA,Clallam County,,Forks,110 West,"Date: Oct. 2000. Location, lower Sol Duc River, FS Marker D2000, north of Hwy 110.   This event happened during one of my many fishing trips to the Olympic Penninsula.  I traveled this forest service road D2000. This is an off road private forest area owned by Rayonier. I fished the first turn out many times. Often at the first turn out, which is pretty isolated, I would hear big thuds when I would be outside my vehicle working on my fishing setup. It sounded like a huge rock bouncing back and forth, starting slow and then speeding up only to then abruptly stop. If I could describe it, I would say it went, Thud (2 seconds pass), then Thud (two more seconds would pass) then the thuds went quicker. Overall, it was Thud...Thud...Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud.Thud. Then it was silent. I thought it was odd, but I was armed with my Colt .45 and fearless. I was alone as I often was in those days. So that day I decided to go further down the trail, proud of my 4x4 and it's capabilities I reached the end of the road that had a 4x4 trail that ultimately ended near the river. When I fish I'm stealthy. I'm real silent when I approach the river. So after I parked and walked down to the river I started casting. I fealt kind of odd and frightened and I shrugged it off as just being alone in the woods.   After my second cast I decided to have a cigarette. Dang nicotine! As soon as I used my lighter I heard a large crack in the bushes across the river from me. This was probably a distance of 40 feet. I looked up, startled to see the thick bushes moving alot across the river, but not too worried because I had the river as a safety buffer. It was thick brush and I thought it was an animal sleeping in the bushes. I saw a big brown figure moving in the bushes but I couldn't make out any details. The bank where the bushes were had a slope above it that was probably a 30 degree angle. This posed an uphill path for the figure in the bushes. Then, the next thing I know I see a tree, in the brush, probably two feet in width (not too big, but not too small)that suddently cracked and fell up the hill! It was apparent that whatever I saw had run into the tree, probably startled by my presence because about 10 feet away from that tree was another tree, that cracked and fell up the hill in the path of the brown creature hastly departing the bushes.  After that, the creature was gone into the deep brush and forest adjacent to the river.  I was convinced this was Bigfoot. Never in my life had I experienced a tree cracking and falling up hill or the sight of something that large that had moved so quickly.  I immediately pulled out my gun and ran back to the truck. I drove very quickly out of the area with my heart racing. ",see story,No,The HOH River is 20 miles south.,"Morning light, bright enought to see.

He reports that a bear (even a large bear on it's hind legs) would not demonstrate the shoulder width that this animal did. He said there are elk there all the time when he drives home but due to the size of the shoulders and color of the hair it was not an elk.

53051,1580,6303,2002,Summer,August,WA,Pend Oreille County,"I am not sure as to how to get to the actual campground spot except by boat! We put in our kayaks at the Noisey Creek campground at Sullivan lake, and kayaked around the right side of the lake (unsure what direction that was)to the swimming hole and campground that was on the far end of the lake. The rope swing was only about a hundred yards from the beach on the right side(heading in)of the lake.",Ione,Sullivan Lake road (I think)," My friends and family and I were Kayaking across Sullivan Lake in North Eastern Washington. We had spent the entire day slowly making our way around the side of the lake that is unpopulated (there is a highway on the opposite side of the lake). We ""beached"" at the far end of the lake where there was a small campground/swimming area, and it was there that me had lunch and let the teenagers swim and mess around. All of the adults felt very uneasy as if we were being watched and we made sure we kept the families close together. When we had to use the out houses we walked together and returned quickly to the beach. As we were beginning to leave the beach several of us noticed a rope swing on a very steep bank of the lake only about a hundred yards from the swimming area. I was among the last ones into a boat so by the time I came to the area of the rope swing, the others had already passed it and were quite a ways ahead of me (approx. 200 yards ahead). I was just daydreaming and enjoying the scenery,  ( and to be honest with you glad to be away from the uneasiness that I had felt at the beach )when a movement caught my eye near the rope swing. AT first I couldn't focus on what it was and it took me a moment to realise what I was looking at. There next to the rope swing on a stump sat an old man.He was very tall and dressed in grey from head to foot.( My own father is 6'6"" and I remember thinking to myself that this old man must have had him beat by at least 10 inches!) His legs were crossed and he had his hands clasped in front of his upper knee. I smiled and waved to him as I floated closer to him. He didn't move. He was tottaly still and watched me very intently. AS my boat passed in front of him (about 15 yards), I realised that this man wasn't wearing any clothes at all and he was covered completely with a very thick silver fur! Even his eyes were almost completely hidden from a thick (eyebrow?)of silver fur. WE stared at each other the entire time I passed by him, myself with my jaw gaping (I'm sure), and he just quietly sitting very still. AS soon as I looked ahead to see where everyone else was at and then looked back toward the rope swing, he was gone and just the branches of the bush that was near it was moving. I have never seen anything like it before in my life. I thought I was honestly seeing things until my niece pulled me aside later that evening and asked me if I had seen the Sasquatch that was sitting by the rope swing. I honestly have never really given much thought to Bigfoot before that day.  I had passed close enough to him to actually see the direction the fur was growing in! It was mostly all one direction (down)like a dog's hair, except around his eyes were it seemed to stick straight out.","Just that we all had felt uneasy at the campground. There were a few other people that were there when we first arrived, but they left quite a while before our group did. All of us felt like we were being watched while at the beach. Also that it surprised me the way he (?) was sitting and the color of his fur was not at all what I had expected. Even the shape of his head was more human than mongoloid or ape shaped. He had high cheekbones and a strong jaw, but he most definatly looked like an elderly man from a distance, not animal at all (except for thick silver fur). It also seprised me how quickly he was able to get out of the clearing and dissapear.As steep as the bank was, he must have been extremely agile and quick! I did hear some twigs snap very briefly,when I could no longer see him, but my eyes couldn't pick up on his color in the trees after he left the stump.","The only other person that saw it was my niece. She was kayaking ahead of me in her own boat. NONE OF US WERE DRINKING, it was a family outting.","This was the first time I had ever heard of anything about Sasquatch or Bigfoot being in this area. I always thought there were sightings on the coastal areas of Washington, but never anything this far inland.","When I spotted him(?) it was around 4:30-5:00 pm. It was a very bright, sunny day. Very good kayaking weather (no wind!).","Sullivan lake is nestled in between dense forested mountains. It is where the big-horn sheep winter. The banks are very steep and it is very unpopulated.  It is A very large lake that took us all day to kayak and we never saw any other boaters. The only human interaction with it seemed to be where the campground area is, and the highway on the opposite side. VERY BEAUTIFUL! ",first weekend

53069,1596,6425,1978,Fall,November,WA,Wahkiakum County,,Grays River,Hwy 101,"Creature description: The creature we both saw was at least 7 feet tall, possibly more, had bright red eyes, which kind of glowed in the near dark light conditions that we were in. This creature which turned in front of me less than 6 feet away, was a real hulk, big barrel-chested, massive arms and shoulders, and the really impressive fact was it never made a sound when it turned to leave, it just seemed to float away. It was very hard to keep calm, but I knew almost as soon as I saw those red eyes what this creature must be. I have hunted and fished this country for years and have never had anything like this happen before, but I truly wish I could see him again, and may yet.   My self and my hunting partner, whom I will call DW was hunting elk in this area, which was old growth timber, about 3-4 miles from the nearest logging road. We had started early that morning and had jumped a large herd of elk which contained several large bulls, but were unable to get a shot. We decided that we would wait until the late afternoon when the elk returned to this area, as we wanted the large 5-point bull that was in that herd. Since we were using muzzle-loaders, or black powder rifles we knew that we wanted a close shot so we stayed down by the river as to conceal ourselves. Well the elk never showed, so we had just started our hike out of the timber, following the river as there was more daylight showing. I was in the lead, going around a tree in the trail when I came face to face with a large creature, with bright red eyes, which were at least 24 inches over my head. The creature turned and was out of sight in less than 30 seconds, and boy was I scared. DW and I still had at least 2 more miles to hike out, and this was the same way the creature had fled. We both decided to give this thing some time to clear out of the area before we started to leave. Needless to say we were extremely glad to get back to the truck that evening. We have only told a few friends what happened that evening, and only tonight I felt compelled to write to your email address to share this story with others, whom may have similar experiences but choose to keep them to themselves. I urge you to let others know of your sightings, DW, and myself know what we saw, and are more certain everyday that all of the outdoorsmen, hunters, fishermen, and etc. share the forests with these creatures.

I stayed up after everyone had gone to bed to let the camp fire burn down. I had noticed earlier that day the dogs would go nuts barking into the woods. Since there were no other campers within miles of us I figured it was deer or some other critter they were barking at. It was after midnight and was quite dark the fire was down to coals. I got this intense feeling that I was not alone, I put it down as over active imagination that feeling you get when you are alone but feel like someone is watching you, so I decided to head for the tent.  Some time in the morning between 3:00am and 4:00am I was awakened by what I thought was coyotes howling. It was high pitched. It was not loud at first but grew in intensity, it awakened my wife also, it sounded like one than others joining in. It sounded like five or six animals as it grew in intensity. I knew it was not anything I had heard before. I jumped up thinking it was an alarm and that the woods were on fire but the night was dark and no smoke so we listened to it and could tell it was some sort of animals. I thought it was elk my wife and sister inlaw had spotted a heard down the road earlier that day but I have never heard elk sound like this and if it was they were in pain, as I said it started out low and others joined in and it grew in intensity like it was far away and getting closer it lasted about 10 maybe 15 seconds and then just stop abruptly! It was in unison starting with one than another until it sounded like 5 or 6 going at the same time and then just stopped all at once. It was a very high pitched scream, not a trumpet like an elk or the squeek of a deer and it was not the cry of a cougar. I have heard these animals before and this was new to me.  When we were on our way home after the camp out we stopped at the Eagles Cliff store and my wife mentioned what we heard to the girl working there and she said there had been other people that had heard it too and some mentioned having rocks thrown at them out of the dark.

All I can say is it was something I had never heard before.","Dogs barking at the woods earlier that day, I made the comment that whatever it was is bigger than them, that same night before i came to the camp fire (I was napping in the tent) my sister inlaw said she saw something move in the trees on the other side of camp near the tent the kids were using but it was to dark to realy see.","My wife, everone else slept through it.",Just that the girl at Eagles Cliff had heard other reports of the screams and rocks being thrown but she did not say how recent they were.,"Between 3:00am and 4:00am, it was a warm calm night following two cold nights.","Dense forest, a creek, its right on a forestry road with some trail heads near.",25

This past June,2003, around the 17th, about 5 PM, we were hiking the Quinault Rainforest Nature Trail,on the south shore of the lake, down at the Cedar Bog area. While at the bog, something dark and large moved behind the reeds/ tall plants there, about 10 yards from where we stood. It could have been a bear, or something that had been crouched down looking for something.Whatever it was, it moved away, and we never got a [good] glimpse of it.      On June 19th, we took the hike up to Wolf Bar around 5 o'clock P.M. Twice,on our way up, we heard what sounded like rapping/ tapping on a hollow log, back towards the places on the trail where we had already hiked. Since there was a herd of Roosevelt elk in the area, we didn't think too much about it. When we got to the end of the main trail, we stayed about 15 minutes just enjoying the quiet. There were no other hikers that we passed. We decided to turn back when we began to smell a strange, not very pleasant smell, and heard 3 knocks on what seemed to be hollow wood (this time the sound came from just past the end of the main trail, where we hadn't been.) I kind of joked about the smell, thinking that it was only the shallow water in the stream there. But we had remained at the same place near the trail end, and had not smelled that smell during the prior 15 minutes.       The next day, about 7:00 P.M. we took the short hike to Irely Lake. On our way back, the sunlight was getting fairly dim, so we had to watch where we were walking. About 3/4 of the way back, we heard this tremendous sustained roar-growl sound - almost like it was out of a science fiction movie. Not like any bear that we've heard, and certainly not at all like a mountain lion. It was loud, but seemed to be somewhat distant - perhaps 100 or so yards off in the forest. And it never repeated itself. We scurried back to our car and drove home.     We hesitated about reporting this, simply because we love that area and were worried about what publicity would do to the area if indeed a bigfoot/ family of bigfeet were found there.

Turn left into Snoqualmie Snow Park and follow gravel road.  Turn left at the fork and follow until you come to the banks of the Nooksack River.  Campsite is on the right (Silver Fir Campground).,Maple Falls,Mount Baker Highway,"I have been an amateur sasquatch researcher for 10 years.  I recently had an experience that I would like to share with you.    My friends and I were camping on the Nooksack River. Our campsite is a 'freebie' meaning it is on the Federal Land in the Mount Baker National Forest.  Our site was protected underneath the forest canopy, with the river bank approximately 20 feet away.  We were having a 'bachelorette camping party' for our friend.  Three of us arrived at the campsite at about 11:00 am on Friday, August 15th and set up the camp without incident.  To tell you the truth, I was looking forward to a weekend with the girls.  Two more girls arrived and set up their tents. The entire area was on a fire ban so we had to cook our dinner using the propane stove.  We had a few drinks, but nothing substantial and we stayed up talking until about 11:00pm.  We secured the site for animals and we each climbed into our tents to get a good night sleep as we were hiking Hannigan Pass the next morning.  Around the 2:00am - 3:00am point (not sure) I could hear something in the site.  We are all seasoned hikers and have become accustomed to hearing 'critters' in the campsite.  I know for a fact that the other girls usually wore earplugs so these sounds didn't drive them crazy.  I was lying awake (a little bout of insomnia) and just assumed it was a racoon or something.  Although, in my mind sounded a little bigger than a racoon. I kept quiet and tried not to move while my heart was beating rather fast.  The sound came closer to my tent and then something brushed up against my tent (enough to crinkle the tarp I was using as a fly).  My tent was a 5 foot high dome tent and whatever it was crinkled the tarp near the top.  The sound went away shortly after that.  As a researcher, I should have stuck my head out of the tent to see what it was, but that is the closest I have ever come to an actual sighting and it was a little too close for comfort.  To make a long story short... I was scared out of my wits.  The next morning, the girls were up and making coffee.  They were preparing for their hike.  I made a conscious decision not to tell them about the encounter as most of them are skeptical about this animal.  I made an excuse not to go on the hike. I had a badly cracked callus on my heel so it wasn't difficult to beg out. Just before the girls left, one of the girls (Allyson) came over to me and asked if I had heard anything strange during the night. I told her what I heard and she told me that something had 'walked' around her truck and gave it a nudge.  Allyson sleeps in her truck bed (which has a canopy).  She said she looked out the window and saw a shadow... then it was gone.  I asked her to keep this to herself and the girls left on their hike.  I began to 'audit' the campsite for tracks or other evidence.  Since the girls were up and around before me, I had no idea if there would be anything visible or not.  I started with my tent.  My tent was pitched between two old growth trees with approximately 4 feet of space on either side.  On the left side of the tent (facing the door) between the tree and the tent were 2 footprints - one print was sunk at least an inch into the pine mulch.  The other print was more to the rear of the tent, but not castable.  I tool my tool and boxed both prints.  I stood beside the good print and attempted to make a footprint in the pine mulch to see if I could get it an inch deep.  I wasn't even close.  I barely disturbed the mulch enough to get an outline.  I went in the direction the prints were sort of headed and about 5 feet off the deer trail I found one more track.  Half the track was in a little puddle of dried mud and the other half was in the mulch.  Unfortunately, the mud side wasn't enough to cast.  I boxed that track and moved on to the other tents.  There was nothing visible around the other tents so I moved on to the vehicles.  I discovered 5 tracks around Allyson's truck.  Her truck was parked more on the hard dirt so only the outlines were visible, but they were not deep enough to cast.  Two of the tracks had sandal prints over top of them.  I am assuming they belong to Allyson.  After I boxed the prints, I checked for any prints or hair on the sides of the vehicle.  There was a smudge in the dirt on the passenger side door, but nothing I could consider as tangible evidence.  I walked over to the Explorer and found another 4 tracks.  Some of the tracks had been tromped on by the girls getting their packs out and such, but there was nothing castable.  I boxed them and and continued to look around the campsite to no avail.  It didn't surprise me that there was nothing around the firepit or perimeter as the girls were up a good hour before I was so they probably destroyed anything that might have been there.  I got out my kit and cast the one good track beside my tent.  It measured 12 1/4"" in Length and 7 1/4' in width (width was measured between the two points of the 'ball') and 7/8' deep.  My guess is that it was an adolescent as it was not as big as I have seen in the past.  It was definitely larger than any man's foot I have ever seen.    As I waited for the cast to dry, I thought I would make myself a cup of coffee and read my book for awhile.  I was sitting in my camp chair and I heard some 'clicking' sounds about 100 feet back into the forest.  It almost sounded like two rocks being hit together, or perhaps the sound of someone pounding in a tent peg.  I went back reading and almost a half an hour later, the clicking was still going on.  I decided to venture back into the woods (with bear spray in hand) to see where it was coming from.  As soon as I reached the beginning of the deer trail, it stopped.  I know it sounds like a cliché, but I really understand now what people are saying when they feel like they are being watched.  The hairs on my arms and neck were standing on end and it was about this time I was really wishing I had not stayed behind.  I went back over to my chair and sat down. I thought if I put the radio on, it would get my mind off of this stuff for awhile.  I checked the cast and it was still tacky. Although my research tells me that these animals try to avoid humans as much as possible (as do bears), I was really starting to get scared. I got my book and I sat in my car for awhile and blasted the heat. Once in a while, I would get out of the car and check the cast. The clicking was still there. The atmosphere was really erie. It was a little overcast it seemed as if the temperature dropped 5 or 10 degrees. Finally I said to myself ""you've been waiting ten years for this - stop being a baby"" and I got out of the car. By this time the cast was dry and I lifted it up. Because this was cast in pine mulch, I had to get as much of the mulch off as possible. When doing that, I noticed some black hairs embedded in the cast around the ouside of the print.  The hairs are about an inch and a half in length. By this time the clicking had stopped but I still felt like someone was watching me. I made the decision to put the cast in my trunk and not mention any of this to girls as I did not want to scare them (and I didn't want to be subjected to the ridicule of non-believers). I saved the one print that I had cast, but I went around and destroyed all the other prints. I decided to make myself something to eat and wait for the girls to return.  When the girls got back, I walked towards them and they said ""You look like you've seen a ghost"". I told them that it was really eerie here by myself and that I was glad they were back. The girls went into their tents to change into their bathing suits so they could go down to the river to wash. Allyson came over to me and asked me what happened. I told her everything, but asked her not to say anything to the other girls. Allyson mentioned that her friends live in Maple Falls and they have problems with sasquatch all the time. They hear screams, their gardens are raided and there are commotions at night.  She said that her friends have dealt with them for years and it has just become a part of life.  I eventually told the girls and they were a little scared/excited going to sleep that evening. I explained that whatever it was, was curious and probably wouldn't come back.  To my knowledge... it didn't. ",Found 12 tracks (one was cast).  Heard clicking noises.,Only myself and another camper (who was sleeping in the back of her truck) actually heard/saw something.  The other girls were dead asleep in their tents. This didn't surprise me as we are all seasoned hikers and are used to 'critters' being in the camp at night.

It was getting late around 11:00 PM so I decided to pitch my tent just for the night off a Forest Service Rd. heading south from State Highway 410. I was wide awake reading a magazine inside my tent when I heard a distinct animal vocalization essentially identical to the recordings on the BFRO website listed as the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings.  The call consisted of a 20 to 30 second duration ""shriek/howl"" and multiple ""bark/grunts"" of short duration lasting about 90 seconds. My Golden Retriever was sound asleep for most of the vocalization but woke up for the last 15 seconds and immediately bacame alert peering out into the darkness. I was surprised at his reaction due to the fact I could barely hear the grunts near the end of the incident and I thought my dog was pretty hard of hearing as he is 11 years old.",The similarity to the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings really struck me immediately.

53027,1683,7003,1978,Summer,June,WA,Grays Harbor County,between Lake Quinault and Neilton on Hwy 101.,"Neilton, WA",HWY 101,"I was headed south in a delivery truck when my eye caught movement on the right side of the road maybe 200 yards ahead. The creature had been standing motionless at the side of the road. It was facing the road then it spun around counter clockwise and in less than 3 steps was gone back into the timber with its arms swinging as it stepped. I saw him for 2.5 seconds. It was solid black or dark brown. It was very large with huge shoulders. I think he was standing there looking to see if it was safe to cross, then turned around and retreated because of the approaching vehicles.  I thought what the heck was that? Did I see what I just saw? It moved like a large man but it is a solid color. I saw one color. It didnt have any clothes on. You just start trying to rationalize in your head what you just witnessed. Did I just see a sasquatch? It was hard to believe I seen one. Still is.  Sometime before this - maybe 6 months - on the TV news was a story of a tour bus driver up in British Columbia, Canada that had to hit the skids to keep from hitting a Bigfoot that crossed the road in front of him. He quickly opened the door and chased it into the woods. Just inside the woods he ran into it or came face to face with it and it like screamed at him or something. He had to quickly turn tale and run.   This was fresh in my mind when I came upon the spot where the creature retreated back into the woods. I slowed my truck down to a slow roll but there was no way I was going to stop and get out to look for tracks or to see if I could see it up close and personal. I wasnt going to leave the security of my truck. I looked into the timber best I could as I passed but I didnt see him.  There was a sedan roughly 100 hundred yards in front of me, half way between me and the creature. No other cars on the stretch. The tail lights never came on when the creature moved and they didnt come on when the car approached the spot in the road where the creature stood. It didn't appear to slow at all. I thought how can it be that the car didnt see it? They were twice as close to it as I was and the thing was huge. The only thing I can guess is the driver of the car looked down to mess with something on his dashboard and took his eyes off the road for the 2 to 2.5 seconds it took the creature to turn and retreat. I hope they did see it and that they submit a report, too.  My next delivery was to an elderly man on Moody Rd. just off of Kirkpatrick Rd. at Humptulips. I was still pretty excited about what I had just seen no more than a half hour before and when I told him what I saw he looked at my like I was on drugs. That was my last stop so when I got back to the warehouse I told my boss Darrell Winters and a coworker Larry Trader what I had just seen. They had a good time laughing at me. Thats ok, I know what I saw. If I didnt see it with my own eyes I would be a skeptic too I guess. ",,There was another car. It is unknown if they witnessed incident.,There were several very credible sightings that made the local news in Grays Harbor Co. 7 to 8 years before my sighting that are posted on this web site. Also my late brother said that he and his wife narrowly missed hitting one crossing the Wishkah Rd. out of Aberdeen in the early to mid 80s. His wife said they could see the long hair hanging from its arm like the fringe on a leather jacket. I saw another story on this web site or another about a sighting by a lady 3 miles south of my sighting on the same Hwy 101. She was on her way to Klalock from I think Yakima to meet up with her family. It crossed the road in front of her at a much closer distance and she saw it for about 8 seconds. This took place around 2001. Its been a while since I read that story.

53041,1689,7038,2002,Fall,November,WA,Lewis County,North of packwood on Tatoosh ridge.,Packwood,Hwy 12,"Hello        I'd like to start out by saying I'm not a believer.  I now consider myself a skeptic.  I started out on 01 Nov 02 on my very first elk hunt.  All my friends told me to go and hunt in Packwood.  So being in the Army I did a good map recon. Talked to the locals and head out for my hunt.  I drove about about 30 minutes north of Packwood on the 02 Nov 03 The day was kinda warm. So I packed light. I had my rifle, pistol and a small day pack with camera. I hiked about 5 hours till I got to the top of the ridge line. Stop for lunch and decided to take some pictures cause it was so beautiful up there.  There where small patches of snow behind rocks and trees where the sun couldn't reach.  As I walked around a big rock I' saw these tracks that took my breath away. Well I'm not one to scare quickly and there is not much that scares me except sharks but after see these tracks in the snow. It made me feal very uneasy. After calming down I pulled out my camera and took these 2 photos the last 2 pictures in the camera. My foot is a 11 regular but the track was about 2"" wider and maybe 3"" longer. After taking the last picture something threw a rock. It didnt push it or it didnt fall on its own it was about 150 meters away but when the rock hit it started alot of other rocks to fall. So I took out my bino's and glassed in the direction the rock came.  I could see what looked like a indention in the rocks. So after I calmed down again I decided to come down off that mountain kinda quickly.  Again I'm not a believe but something spooked me I guess it's the fear of the unknown.

It evidently came down the hill from the right heading in a north to south direction. ,Naches,Hwy 410,I was traveling west on road 1502 (which is graveled) looking for a campsite for bow season. I glanced in my rearview mirror and saw a very large upright creature step to the middle of the road. I immediatly slowed down and quickly glanced around for a safe spot to pull over and there wasn't one I looked back over my shoulder through my canopy window and saw that the creature was still standing in the middle of the road. There was still a lot of dust in the air from where I had passed and all I could make out was that What I was looking at was very tall maybe (7 to 8 feet) and broad it also was very dark in color. The arms appeared to be held out slightly from the sides and reached to about mid thigh. when I reached a full stop the creature seemed to pivot on its left leg while swinging its arms turned to the left and took one step to the opposite side of the road and disapeared from view. When I looked at the area where it crossed I was unable to discern any tracks in the gravel that I could definately say were footprints. The area where the creature went off the road is very steep and rocky. I would not want to try going down it without ropes and I doubt if what I saw was another hunter out scouting since the hill ends in a cliff just a few hundred yards down.  ,Normally there are a lot of deer in the area The party I was with saw very few deer and only 2 elk for the week we were there and very little sign.

My friend Sean and I went down to the rope swing which was about 200 yards down hill from the house.  We had decided to call it a day and were putting our shoes and shirts on for the short hike back up the hill.  As we got ready to go, we could hear something approaching from the north of us.  This all happened in a short period of time but it seemed like an eternity.  Immediately we could tell it was on two feet; assuming that it was a person, I thought they were jumping from foot to foot.  The strides were very far apart.  I called out twice (who's there?  who's there?).  There was no reply.  As it got closer I could hear branches breaking underfoot.  Looking back, this thing was very large.  The brush there is very dense, on the side of the hill, so we could not see what was coming.  When it was no more than 40 yards away I could see it.  It swept back a vine maple, and looked at us like it was surprised.  It's very hard to explain but it looked like a person in a way.  It was not as tall as I had heard that they were, maybe 7'0"" at the most.  It had very wide shoulders, and was very muscular.  I did not smell a foul odor.  Its face did look somewhat human - I think it's the way it looked at us.  Anyway, almost as soon as we had seen it, we both turned and ran up the hill, grabbing branches to pull our way up.  I never looked back but I thought I could hear it chasing us for a short distance.

Being a new residence to Washington at the time I had no knowledge of any ape-like creatures in the woods.  I can remember it was an early Wednesday morning and heavy overcast with snow still clinging to the shaded areas. We ended up first on a black-top road which gave way to gravel that became extremely narrow and twisting as we climbed higher into the mountains.    With my son grumbling and my dog needing to lift a leg along with me being not sure we were even on the right road I decided to turn around and go back to let him drop his line in a stream we passed by. Parking the car we proceed to walk a ways downstream some 150-200 yards.  With our dog out ahead I had my hands full half carrying my son and equipment through the brush.  It was when stream made a sharp turn that I first caught wind of a foul smell, a bad odor which is hard to explain.  At about the same moment our dog came whimpering back all nervous acting and hanging under my feet.    I looked in the direction which the dog just came and by my estimates no more than 30-35 yards away was ""something"" hunched down and apparently ripping apart the carcus of an animal. It was hairy and extremely large.  Upon seeing us it rose and looked right at us.  It did not show fear and for the life of me I don't remember seeing its eyes, yet my son who was starting to cry kept saying ""look at its eyes"".  Dropping everything except my son I made a hasty retreat back towards the car.  We could not have made more than 20 feet when it let out a scream that to this day still sends chills through me.  I have never heard anything or want to hear anything like it again.  I have never been one to get overly jarred about things but that encounter unnerved me.  I thought for sure we were going to be attacked.  It made several of these screams and once atop a little ridge I looked back and could still see it standing there near the water.

53015,1750,7382,2001,Summer,July,WA,Cowlitz County,Beginner's Hole,Kalama,Kalama River Rd,"             Up until last year I owned a bait and tackle store on the Kalama River in Kalama, Wa. I guess I would have to say that there were some strange things happening to several of my customers who would fish directly upstream from my store at a hole known as Beginner's Hole.   For instance, one of my customers, Steve and his girlfriend Tasha, arrived on the river a couple of hours before daylight and decided to get some rest in there car before the usual crowed arrived. They laid there seats backed and turned up the radio when all of a sudden something hit the driver's side window with enough force to almost break the glass. Steve later told me that he thought it must have been a rock of considerable size as it shook the whole car. He immediately started the car and turned on his lights only to find nobody could be seen in the large parking area and Tasha was so shook up by it that she made him leave and spend the rest of the night parked under the lights of my store.   I guess I really didnt think much of to until approximately a week or so later at about 9:30pm after just locking up for the night and being startled by someone frantically pounding on my store door only to open it and find a very scared fisherman who had claimed to have seen a Bigfoot within a block of my store just standing on the riverbank looking at him walk by on the road 75 feet away. It was late May or early June (2001) so it had just gotten dark. I cant remember ever seeing a grown man so afraid of a wild animal in my life as Jason was at that moment. He just kept saying that he just witnessed Bigfoot and to stay inside for fear it was going to get us. I grabbed a flashlight and tried to talk him into showing me where he had seen it but he refused to go outside, insisting I was crazy because he said it must have been at least 7 foot tall.   A week or so later I went up to Beginner's Hole at about 10:30pm with my beer distributor Travis to do some glowballing for summer-run steelhead as I had for many years in the past when it started to get warmer and the fish seemed to get more active. We pulled into the parking area and I ran over the bank so I could get the first cast because it was usually payday and Travis stood in front of the headlights still rigging his pole. I had taken several casts with no luck when I noticed the fish down river in the deep hole were jumping like I had never seen before. I climbed up the bank as Travis was just finishing and told him to come on. We were going to walk down and see what was going on. As we arrived at the hole about 200 yards down stream, we quickly climbed down the bank and began casting. Travis was located 50 feet below me behind a large bush when I heard a loud splash from his direction. Thinking he must have fallen in I yelled to see if he was alright when to my surprise we were face-to- face and he was yelling for me to run in a very  panicked voice! I wasted no time following him up the bank because it must have been something pretty serious to scare Travis as he stands 6ft tall and weighs over 220 lbs. As we climbed in the car, he was yelling something about a giant ape-like figure that had porpoised, went under and then came back out of the water and jumped. What ever it was, it must have been very large judging by the sound that I had heard and seeing that Travis was very wet from the splash that it had made. I guess thats when I started believing that maybe Bigfoot was real! Being very knowledgeable of the river and the fish runs, I came to the conclusion that combined with the fact that for the last few years the woods had been closed to public entry 90% of the season and that the summer-run steelhead where being let go out of the lower hatchery and almost all of them stopping at Beginner's Hole because thats where they had been released that maybe it had come down from up river looking for food and quite possibly had found a steelhead paradise.   It took several days before I or Travis had found the nerve to venture back up there but the thought of those fish made us finally give in to our fear. What a mistake! Arriving at the hole, I as usual ran over the bank to get the first cast and Travis as usual stood rigging his pole in the headlights. As I started to cast I felt very uneasy and continued looking up and down the river trying to see in the nighttime darkness when directly across the river from me I heard a baseball-sized rock hit the water a few feet off the far bank. I strained my eyes to see what had thrown it thinking that after telling several of my customers of the earlier incident that maybe someone was playing a trick or something. Thats when I heard it! A low, deep moan-like sound that turned into a high pitched scream. I have been in the woods enough to know that there is no animal that could possibly make the noise that I had just heard and it surely wasnt a customer. As I screamed for Travis I felt reassured to see him already coming over the bank asking what the hell had made that noise. He couldnt even finish his sentence before that sound let loose again! It seemed to be on the opposite shore and running directly away from us at a speed I had never seen an animal run at before. It almost seemed like a bird it was going so fast through the trees directly away from us up the hill. It had seemed like seconds before it reached the top of the hill maybe an eighth of a mile away and remained there for several minutes making a noise that had every hair on your entire body standing at perfect attention. Then as quick as it had started it stopped and we found ourselves climbing in the car speeding for the safety of my store where we sat up all night going over and over what we had just heard.   It wasnt until a couple of weeks later that I was forced into going back there because I am a licensed fishing guide and the only one who does nighttime drift boat trips down the river. Seeing that I had two paying customers, one a young man in his late twenties from Iowa and the other, a regular customer who also owns a house on the river, I felt obligated to do my best to get them fish and as scary as it may seem, I knew that beginners was the spot. I launched the boat directly into Beginner's Hole at about 10:30pm and had planned to take about a 2 mile trip down stream hoping to get a quick fish or two out of the hole and get the hell out of there but the fish just werent going for it. Every time I suggested that we head on down I was cut off by the local home owner telling me that we were in the hot spot and he wanted to try it longer and to quit being a baby, that there was no such thing as bigfoot. He, too, had heard the rumors going around about what I had seen. As he teased me, it got the Iowa guy asking all kinds of questions because that was the first he had heard of the monster that lived at Beginner's. I tried to avoid the hole thing as best as I could but he wasnt about to leave it alone and talked me into telling my story.   I was almost finished reciting the months' events when something happened that I will never in all of my life forget. All of a sudden the pole that I was holding almost got ripped from my hands and I yelled fish on! Or so I thought. It took but seconds to realize that something was not right by the way it was pulling. It felt like I had hooked into a bail of hay that had floated by in the heavy current but yet you could tell that it was alive. The Iowa guy was screaming for me to give him the rod cause that was to be his first steelhead ever and he took the rod from my hands. As I stood there in my drift boat watching the line slowly peel off of the reel, I couldnt help but feel confused about what could possibly be attached to the other end when it stood up in the middle of the river 30 feet below my boat and seemed, by the glowing corkies and sand shrimp, to be hooked in the left shoulder and not at all comfortable with the whole situation, nor where either of the two gentlemen in the front of my boat. The Iowa guy was shouting something about it being a dead body and I cant recall the local man saying anything at all. The river was about 4 1/2 feet deep where it was and it seemed to me in the moonlight to be standing waist deep, slowly swinging its arms trying to get free. As I pulled my anchor and tried to stay my distance, the Iowa guy was pulling for all he was worth. I was using 30Lbs line and there wasnt much chance of it breaking. Maybe 3 minutes passed or so it seemed like before it finally freed itself and dove under water never to be seen again, just a wake of water heading downstream into the deep hole and as far as I could tell, never coming up for a breath in at least 100 yards till it rounded the bend and out of sight. To this day I have not fished Beginners Hole and I am no longer a guide. I mainly stay at home and work on computers. What happened to me on the Kalama River will stay with me for the rest of my life and Im sure that all of this sounds pretty strange but I will tell anyone who wants to know the names of every person involved and would gladly take them to the place and show them. I am almost certain that if someone was to spend next spring and summer at beginners hole on the Kalama River between the hours of 10:00pm and 4:00am it will quite possibly change the way they view Bigfoot for the rest of there life!

Sighting occurred on an open, rocky face, within 1/4 mile of Lewis Peak, just before leaving the National Forest boundary.",Dixie,Lewis Peak Road,"My dad got drawn for a big bull elk permit in the Mill Creek Watershed. He harvested a bull on November 1, off of Green Peak. We were packing out meat on Tuesday, November 4 in the late afternoon. We were taking our time following the trail back to Lewis Peak. There was about an hour of light left. We stopped at a rock outcropping to take a breather when I saw motion out of the corner of my eye.   I told my dad that there was something coming across the openning we had just previously crossed. I was not sure what it was, as it had moved behind a tree. As it continued across the ridge, I noted that the animal was walking on two legs. The distance from where we were to the animal was approximately 500 yards. It was very clearly a bi-ped. We are very experienced hunters (20+ years for me, 40+ years for dad), with a lot of time in the field. We have harvested many, many deer, elk, and bear. This animal walked upright, and very quickly covered the distance across the openning, which was over a steep, loose-shale part of the trail. The trail was covered with packed snow from foot and horse traffic, and was fairly slippery in the cold weather. We had just crossed it, and had to take our time with the backpacks to make sure we did not slip. The animal crossed this openning very quickly, with no apparent difficulty whatsoever. It appeared to be approximately 7-8 feet tall and very dark from head to toe. It did look our direction, but did not stop to observe us.   After a quick debate about what the heck we had just seen, noting that we were not carrying firearms at the time, it was heading in our direction, and that we had two loads of elk parts on our packs, we quickly left the area. I watched the trail as my dad tied the packs to the 4-wheeler, but did not see anything come down the trail.",Hiking through this area for several days we noticed an odd smell that was not familiar to any of the animal species we regularly encounter.,"There were two witnesses, myself and my father.",Have heard of many many sightings in the Blue Mountain areas between Dayton and Walla Walla.,"Late afternoon, about an hour before dusk.","The Walla Walla Mill Creek Watershed is a large area, closed to public access except for one week out of the year, when 40 elk hunters (selected by state game department) are allowed entry by a special Forest Service Permit. The permit holder may bring one other person in with them after they have harvested an animal, to assist with removal of the animal. The area is heavily wooded, extremely steep and rugged terrain, with numerous water sources, and natural grasses  interspersed across some open hillsides. The watershed functions as a large funnel, supplying water for the city of Walla Walla. The upper perimeter has a semi-maintained trail, and there are several less-than-maintained trails that run through the watershed. At the time of the sighting, there was snow on the ground, and conditions were slippery. Weather was below freezing, partly cloudy with periodic snow showers.   The hike from Lewis Peak to Green Peak takes about 1 1/2 - 2 hours, depending on the pace. There is some public land surrounding parts of the watershed, however, neither of these peaks have good public access points.",4
53045,1765,7439,1978 or 79,Summer,,WA,Mason County,"The incident occurred so many years ago, I'm sorry but I just can't remember the exact path of travel we used to get there.  I recall a simple unimproved road to the campsite where we unloaded the vehicle.  Where the incident actually happened should not be too difficult to locate however, as it was along the Hamma Hamma River, which is not very long.",Bremerton,FR 25,"The following incident may be of limited if any value because of the length of time that has elapsed since it occurred.  At the time I was about 32 years of age and had heard of sasquatch or bigfoot but had never had any thoughts about them.  A co-worker (Don W.) and myself had been performing some work for the National Park Service in the State of Washington during the summer of 1978 or 1979.  We had made other trips to the region prior this this trip, but this trip will always stand out in my mind.  On a weekend outing Don and I had decided to do some trout fishing on the Olympic Peninsula.  A Seattle motel owner suggested we try fishing the Hamma Hamma River as it did not get the fishing pressure or the commercial gill netting pressures more common on the famous streams that empty on the west side of the pennsula.  Following his suggestion, we came to a tiny picnic area and unloaded our gear.  Don went downstream and I headed upstream.  By mid-afternoon I was perhaps a mile upstream and had caught several trout.  I was totally alone and concentrating on fishing when out of the corner of my right eye I noticed movement about 10 feet in the air, followed by a tremendous splash about 30 feet to my right in the stream.  Shocked, I found myself looking at very large boulder close to 3 feet long and maybe 2.5 feet thick that wasn't there a few moments before.  I turned around thinking it had rolled off a steep bank, but I was nowhere near anything it could have rolled off of, as I was fishing in a meadow-like area.  At that moment I had a very uneasy feeling come over me, and a feeling that I was not alone.  About 30 feet behind me quantities of tall dead grass filled the bank, and I remember not wanting to look to closely.  I grabbed my fish and headed back to the car at a pretty quick pace.    I did not see anything, nor did I smell anything.  I distinctly remember not wanting to see anything that could throw a 300 pound rock over 30 feet.  When I arrived back at the car, Don had already arrived ahead of me and I told him what happened.  He laughed and made a wise crack about it, and said let's eat some of these fish.  We made a fire in the stove provided at the campsite, ate our fish and left.  That's about all there is to say concerning the incident.  Over the years, I've often thought about what happened and I still can't come up with any possible way that boulder could have landed where it did, without someone or something throwing it.  I've never seen anyone powerful enough to pickup a boulder that size let alone throw it a considerable distance.  I also regret not having the nerve to investigate the area a little more, but I felt very vulnerable at that moment in time.",Nothing.  It was just a one time fishing trip to an area we had not been to before or since.,"None present at the exact site of the incident.  Other than my companion a couple of miles downstream, we never saw any other person in that area that day.","No, as I'm not from the area.

I kept blamming my boss that he had crapped in his pants and he kept accusing me of doing the same he said theres only two of us out here and I know I didnt do it. well anyway we were taking a break from hacking through the brush with our machete and we were leaning against this 200 plus old growth blowdown fir tree. I took a cigarette out and lit up, and then there was this branch or twigs breaking like something large walking through the underbrush about a 120ft away. I could not find any rocks to throw in that direction but found a u shaped piece of wood that I throw near the spot where we heard the sounds. ( take note of piece of u shaped wood because in another encounter a few years later and only a couple of months ago I had that same piece thrown at me) it got quite like I said it was cloudy and kinda dark under the tree canopy. the noise came from the other side of this large salmonberry bushes then all of a sudden the clouds broke open and aloud some daylight through behind the bushes about 10ft so that the four creatures that were watching us you could see their shadow. I told my boss mike to take a look in that direction but because of his bad eye sight he could not see that well. there were two realy big adult males one skinny tall female with shoulder lenght hair and she had a bad hump on her back her breast were like a realy old women and she kept ringing her hands together as she was speaking to the other males. there was a child to her left that stood about 6ft tall but was dwarft by the three larger adult creatures. the two males stood still motionless they watched me and did not talk much to the female that was doing most of the talking in her own dialect the males seamed to motion to her to keep quite then the clouds had covered up the rays of light and it got dark again. my boss mike kinda had seen the shadows but tried to convince me it was his boss ken and some secretarys that he brought out into the woods that sometimes he does. right after that they kept following us and my boss mike got spooked and said lets get out of here and come back next week to finnish our survey.

53027,1768,7455,1999,Fall,October,WA,Grays Harbor County,From Hwy 105 turn onto Smith Anderson Road. There will be a tidal wave evacuation sign on a dirt road on your right. The road is now gated due to people dumping garbage in the hills.,Greyland,Smith Anderson Road off Hwy 105,"This happened during hunting season in 1999 in the hills above Greyland, WA. When you drive down the highway there are signs directing people to drive up in the nearby hills in case of tidal waves. It was up these dirt roads that my husband and I were hunting.  The weather was cold in the morning, there was frost on the ground, by noon it had warmed up and was mild out.  This is written from the view of someone who at the time of this incident knew very little of big foot, and really didn't give them any thought.  We encountered a bear hunter early in the morning that told us he had spotted bear sign the day before and was back to continue the hunt. He also commented to us that this was the worst smelling bear he had ever tracked. By late morning he had his bear and we again spoke with him. I put my head in the canopy of his truck to look at the bear and did not notice any foul smell.  My husband and I continued hunting for deer. We decided to split up. He dropped me off at an old overgrown road and was going to drive over to the one that ran parallell to it. The plan was for me to walk out slowly to the clear cut then go to the right and meet up with him.  As I reached the edge of the clearcut, I stopped to scan for deer. I started from the right slowly looking to the left, nothing. As I stepped out of the cover of the brush to my left, about 100 yards away, underneath the branches of a fir tree and back against the trunk, I saw what looked exactly like the face of a big foot. Now I had never given much thought to these things but this looked so much like one that I froze in my tracks. I was so scared that it took me fifteen minutes to drop my pack, which I was carrying in my left hand, and pick up my binoculars that were hanging from my neck. I had to talk my self into moving. I told my self that it was probably a stump under the tree. I got my binoculars to my eyes and looked at it and it still looked exactly like the pictures you see that people draw. It looked like it was crouching down trying to hide from view underneath the branches. The tree was not big maybe 20 feet tall. It looked like it was staring right at me.  I thought from the first that this thing was a threat to me. I knew nothing of them and was very afraid. Well, I finally decided I could get one shot off before it got to me, my rifle is a bolt action, and I'm not very fast on the draw; it didn't help that I was shaking like a leaf. If I made it to the end of the road, then I would be in sight of my husband, who is a very good shot. Keep in mind that this line of reasoning was the fear of the unknown.  I came out to where I could see my husband and waved to him while walking fast to meet up with him. I told him that there was something under a tree that looked exactly like the sasquatch pictures. He asked if I wanted to go back and check it out, I said no. I was happy to be back in his company.  It was late afternoon by this time and we decided to hunt the right end of the clear cut. He left me sitting against a dirt mound looking across the end of the clear cut. My husband went farther to the right on the next hillside so he could watch the same area. I didn't feel afraid because the truck was just down the road less than 25 yards and I would just go get in if anything happened.  We were both watching the clear cut and it was almost too dark to shoot, when across the cut where the edge of the old growth timber was still standing came the the loudest howling, screaming carrying on that I have ever heard. My husband described it like the howling of a coyote having its legs wrenched off but far to loud for a coyote to make. I can only describe it as a wall of screaming and howling that came up from the valley floor and blanketed everything, there was no place that howling, screaming wasn't. I sat forward and thought what the heck is that.   The sound was coming from in front of where my husband was hunting, we estimate this to be 400 yards. I stayed put but was straining to see what was screaming like that in the corner of the woods, which would be maybe 600 yards from my position. It seemed to be staying just inside the tree line so we couldn't see it. After about twelve minutes of this my husband stood up to leave. When he did the screaming abruptly ended, there was dead silence.....not a sound anywhere.  He came back to where I was and we decided it was time to leave.  We did not do any investigating of sasquatch until two years later when my husband and his relatives were hunting up at Rim Rock lake and had another encounter. When we started checking sasquatch noises on the internet that's when we heard again the howls and screams that we had heard in the foothills by the ocean. We also think that the bear hunter smelled a sasquatch not his bear. And that the thing under the tree probably was a sasquatch watching me.  We now go out with cameras and tape recorders hoping for another encounter.",,"Myself, husband and unknown bear hunter.",,This took place over the course of one day from daybreak till dark.

We kept walking upstream, pausing a few times to listen, each time still hearing the rustling. As we kept walking and trying to see what was making the sounds, we realized whatever it was, was keeping pace with us across the creek. Then we noticed a face peering through an opening in the bushes. It was mostly covered in reddish-brown shaggy hair. The eyes were a golden brown color. The sun was dappled through the branches over head, but light enough to really see it looking back at us. We kept walking another 100 yards or so, with the sasquatch peeking through the bushes maybe 2 more times. ABout then we all looked at each other and remembered that the creek ended upstream in a swampy area and we would be face to face with it if we kept going. Also the realization that we were being paced by a huge seemingly sentient creature panicked us, and we ran back to camp, fast. We told our parents, who took us pretty seriously.

Fifteen years old at the time, I was staying at my uncle's house near Kent, WA. At the rear of the house is a forested area. Around 7 or 8 am on Dec.25, 1986, we were all leaving to visit other relatives and I realized that I had left something inside the house, so went around to the rear entrance and was fumbling at the lock when I heard a tremendous crashing coming towards me through the forest. The oddest thing about the entire incident was my reactions - completely different to what one would expect. Hearing the crashing coming towards me I didn't (as you would expect someone to do) turn around to see what was happening - I felt a tremendous feeling of dread which certainly didn't help my efforts at unlocking the door. Whatever it was that was coming through the forest was making a LOT of noise and sounded BIG. The noise came closer until it was just approximately 30 metres behind me just inside the woodline and to my left, at which point I very slowly turned around (again it is impossible to convey just how frightened I felt) and I saw a creature standing upright and looking at me. It was tall and bulky but definitely not a  bear standing upright because it didn't have the sloping shoulders of a bear but rather looked like a tall, bulky person in a cheap ape suit. I was genuinely paralyzed with fear and could neither make movement nor sound. The hair or fur was dark brown/black/reddish tints but mostly dark from what I could see. It was, as I mentioned, standing just inside the treeline, so the lower legs were hidden from view - only from about midthigh upwards was visible and definitely looked humanlike but with a pointier head than a normal human. I had the feeling that the exchange of looks lasted quite long but probably only lasted a few seconds before I was finally able to move, at which point I raced back round the front of the house and jumped into the car with the rest of the family, who remarked that I looked like I had seen a ghost. I never told anyone about what I had seen because growing up in the Pacific Northwest, one learns to laugh at the nutcases who claim to have seen bigfoot, and I certainly participated in the ridicule until that day. I only ever went to my uncle's house one other time after that day and sometimes now wish I had been brave enough to have looked in the forest for footprints later but it was simply impossible to have done at the time.",,,,Between about 7 and 8 am.

53045,1795,7580,1984/1996,Fall,February,WA,Mason County,Contact me,Shelton,Cloquallum,"actually there is several parts to my report so bare with me.First my background. I am a Mason County resident that has lived here in Shelton for most of my life.My father was a State Fire Warden since the late 1950's up until his retirement in 1978,and my Mother was a floral greens harvester for about 50 years.Consiquently I know this area better than most residents as I also run a business that requires me to be in the woods a lot.I was employed by the USFS from 1970 to 1983 in Fire Management. My first encounter with what I believe to be a Sasquatch was in  October,1984.I was living in Oregon at the time and had came home to visit my folks who resided on the Cloqullam road about 3 miles west of Shelton.One evening as I was sleeping on their couch I heard a screaming noise off in the distance(I am estimating a 1/4 mile)that I can only describe as a cross between a donkey braying,a high pitched scream and a growling noise at the end.What amazed me most was the duration of this howling as it lasted about 15 seconds.About 5 minutes later it howled again, this time much closer to the house and repeats itself twice.I can still recall my parents watchdogs scratching at the door to get in.As the noise got closer I could hear a more distant but unquestionably return answer to the screaming. The thing finally got to within a couple hundred yards of the house and the noise was like an air raid siren.I have never heard any animal as loud as this.It screamed a couple of more times and then it headed back the way it came continuing to scream at intervals until it was a very distant noise and either was out of my range of hearing or had quit.The next morning I asked my parents if they had heard the noise from the previous night.They answered yes and told me that they had been hearing it for years.  I did a little checking around the area and found an elderly couple who with a little urging told me of there encounter about a year before that.The couple lived about a mile from my parents place and were in the habit of taking an evening walk up a pipeline which runs betwwen their place and my parents.One evening'as they put it,something tall,large,and hairy walked from the brush across in front of them into the timber on the other side of the pipeline.It walked on two legs,and was not in a hurry but took long strides and crossed the pipeline in about 5 strides.They said it was about 50 yards in front of them and had a very bad odor. Other people in the area attested to hearing the noises.As a prologue to this about 3 weeks later my parent's dog came up missing and I found him on the pipeline.His neck was broken and he was severly torn up.I don't know if this had any thing to do with the noise but I have always wondered.   My other encounter was in early fall of 1996.I was out with my dog checking on some leases I had with Simpson Timber Company.After my business was finished I stopped at an area I knew I could find some mushrooms to take home.This is in an area near the Satsop River and betwwen the Cloqullam road and the Matlock-Brady road.It was late afternoon around 5:30 pm and I only had about an hour of light left. My dog and I hiked a short way in from the road and I was down on my hands and knees cutting mushrooms when my dog came over to me and tried to get as close as he could.I was mad at him because he was stepping on the mushrooms.I recall getting a whiff of very putrid smelling air.The smell was overpowering almost like something had died with an overtone of rotting garbage.I stood up to see where the smell was comming from and turned to my right and in doing so saw a large hairy creature standing in a fern patch about 200 feet away.We both made eye contact about the same time and I was so startled for a few seconds I had to rationlize what I was seeing. It stood a good 3 to 4 feet above the ferns and was very dark(although it was late, and this could have made it seem darker in color)It turned its head to look back and then turned its torso and arms and as it did I could see long hair on its arms.It proceeded to walk quickly away.I proceeded to walk out and come home.I didn't tell anyone for a couple of days as I kept going over it in my head to ensure myself that this it what I actually saw and I am positive of the events.  I have since then found tracks in the same area which is only about 8 miles as the crow flys from my parents house.

The tracks continued like that as far as I could see. We were leaving at dark everyday, and arriving before light, and it was snowing just about everyday or night.These tracks were fresh. My boss seen bigfoot while he was logging on the olyimpic peninsula and was convinced they were sasquatch.I wasn't sure just yet. Later while working I got a chill up my spine and the hair on the back of my head stood up like it does on a dog or cat when they sense something. I began flipping my head side to side trying to see something but couldn't see anything but it sure felt like I was being watched. Every now and then I would wind an animal up wind. Could have been a wolf, I spotted one in the area. I did hear what sounded like someone banging a stick on a tree. I followed the sound expecting to find a wood pecker, but seen nothing. We were seeing around 15-20 deer a day before that, and hadn't seen any after that day. A truck driver coming up for a load told us you should have seen all the deer leaving the hill. There must have been 30 maybe 40 down by the road. I thought it could have been that wolf pushing them down, or they just had enough snow. There was 3 feet on the ground in places and temp. was 15 below 0. I asked a friend who logged in Idaho for years if he ever had the hair on the back of head stand up while in the woods. He said only once. He was running a saw and bigfoot walked up behind him. I believe bigfoot was watching us.

The directions are go to Harstine Island out of Shelton.   *Edited*,Shelton,*Edited*,"I am having a house built and I had the drain field all dug up for the septic system installation. I was walking around in the dug up area just checking things out and looking for more remains that belonged to the deer skull we found when digging. I found some big tracks in the dirt. The dirt was loose in places but I still barely made a print with my shoes. The prints were pretty big and I only found a few. Maybe three to be exact. They looked like a human print with a big toe and smaller toes and shaped just like human. I took some pictures of the prints but I made the mistake of not putting something next to the print to gauge its size. I dont think anyone would have walked out there barefoot and if they had, they had some tremendous feet. The tracks had to be 14 inches long. The pics arent great because it had rained before I took them. But you can still make out the print.",Just feel uneasy at night when I go outside. Hair standing up on back of neck.

Also there is alot of activity in the Olympic Mountains just a few miles away.  This is a second report that the homeowners submitted in April 2004: I filled out a report a couple of months ago and recently my wife and I heard a strange noise on 2 seperate occasions. Mine happened about 3 weeks ago when we were getting ready to go to work. we commute together and we leave the house about 3o'clock in the morning. She was already in the truck and I locked the house up and was going around the back of the truck, which was already running to warm it up, when I heard what sounded like a really loud scream similar to the ones I have heard on your site. I heard it over the running truck. The noise sounded far away but it was still very loud. Kind of sinister sounding. Im a little hard of hearing from my job, but I heard this real well.  Just the other day I stayed home from work and my wife went by herself. Once again about 3 in the morning she heard a noise when going to her car. It wasnt running so I assume she heard it well. The noise was different though. She said that it sounded like someone talking or kind of mumbling. Not words but just a background talking kind of noise. There is noone around our house, especially at that hour. She thought to herself, oh great, Im going to see bigfoot before my husband does. She just jumped in her car and left.

The exact area cannot be remembered at this time, but it was a couple hours before dark approx 6:30-7:00 P.M., and we were traveling down a dirt road, that inclined and turned slightly to the left, and there was a branch (logging) road that dropped slightly down and to the right as the main road went left.  As we were traveling about 25 MPH, i glanced down the side road, and about 75 feet down the logging road, in the middle of that road was an erect standing creature, approximately 6.5 to 7 feet tall.  Dark brown, almost black.  I did not slow or stop, mostly because I was only armed with a .380 cal auto, and driving a compact mazda 626.  Not too much of a defensive position to take.

I lived with my mother stepfather and stepbrother in a small house on about 5 acres pretty far from anyone, on Rotschy Hill. One day my brother and I were building a fort in the woods on the base of an small hill just on the outside of our property. On top of the hill there was a house that you couldn't see from where we were. So we were working on our fort when we heard a lot of noise on the side of the hill branches breaking, dogs barking - it was very loud and I looked over approx. 250-300 yrds from where we were. I actually first saw the dogs and noticed what they were running after what seemed to be like a gorilla. I say that because of the arms. It was running on the side of the hill, taking large steps, kind of striding on two legs. It seemed to be scared of the dogs. There were 3 dogs running down the hillside about 50 yrds behind it at first. At that point I was sort of in shock and trying to get my brother to see it, too, but from where he was he couldn't see it. From that point on I got really excited to tell my mom and my uncle who also claims to have seen it around Mt. St. Helens awhile back. Of course, nobody really believes me except my brother, so I don't really tell the story now that im 23 and I understand the skepticism that surrounds this subject. This happened about 10 yrs ago so im not sure how usefull I've been in telling this story.","I remember other people around that area talking about seeing what I described growing up there. It wasn't strange to hear somone talking about bigfoot, especially loggers. It seems like everyone there has a story or knows someone that does. Of course, I was young and my story was blamed on a child's overactive imagination.",My little brother thought he never actually saw it. He heard the commotion and knew something was going on. ,"Near there my uncle was hunting with a friend and they where on the edge of a bluff and they both saw what appeared to be the same creature that I described walking through a clear cut on the side of a hill and they watched it for about 15-20 minutes and were never seen by the creature. Unfortunately, their pictures didn't reveal anything. There are many stories like this in that area as im sure you know.","It was probably around 12:00 p.m.-3:00 p.m., overcast light rain or it had been raining.","The environment consisted of evergreen trees, a lot of ferns, a wide winding creek; to the south was a clear cut,  further north about 2 miles up the road are large hills, many large ponds and swamps, creeks , trails, cliffs,many wild animals (cougar, deer, elk etc.). Many large trees, small trees and other vegetation. It would be very easy for someone to get lost,or hide out and never be seen. That's why most of those people live out there.  ",
53053,1921,8407,1970 ,Fall,October,WA,Pierce County,,Spanaway,,"It was October,1970.  I was 14 yrs. old. My parents had bought a home on 224th. At that time, our home sat on 5 acres of heavily treed acres. There was a lot of dense brush, trees, and virgin wooded areas every where including 40 acres of virgin,untouched forest directly across from us on the other side of 224th street. When we first moved there in 1962; My whole family walked out to the forest across the street that I just mentioned and there was dense moss that covered the entire forest floor. In the moss were huge footprints twice the size of a man. There was a distinct musky smell throughout the whole area. I have been around all types of farm animals and had never experienced an odor like this. My father passed it off to my other brothers and sisters that someone was just trying to play a trick. The only thing was is that no one ever went out there. We soon discovered that at the back of our five acre home was a bog as my sister and I had begged to have horses. We soon began to experience weird screams from the back of the property every evening around sunset. On the date I gave in the beginning, I was watching F-Troop(a TV) show with my chair tilted back against a large picture window facing 224th street. My father was in the back yard working and sisters in the kitchen and I was alone. I glanced outside as I was watching TV, and saw this appromitely 7ft. tall grey man-like creature staring at me. It was not more than 5 ft. away from me as it was immediately on the other side of the picture window. Realizing that I just saw something; I turned back around and it was just standing there staring at me. It's eyes were dark and was slightly glowing red.(it was almost dark) It's arms were massive and came down to slightly below the knees. It was all grey in color with black and brown hairs here and there on it's body. I could see it's breathing. It's chest was rising and falling and steam was shooting out it's nose. It could have just reached out and broke that picture window easily from where it was standing and killed me too. I was frozen with fear and had to mentally get the strength to jump out of my chair all the time wondering if it was going to kill me.There was a light dusting of snow on the ground,so even though it was almost dark; the snow caused enough light so I could see every detail about this creature. I noticed that there was long hair smoothly covering it's whole face down slightly past it's jaws. There was no visual evidence of a neck at all. It looked like a massive head sitting on massive shoulders. It's chest and trunk looked large enought to fit two good size men side by side. It's nose and mouth were also covered in this long hair so I could only see where they came out of it's face. It just stood there still staring at me right in the eyes like it was looking right through me. I was so scared that I couldn't talk or scream for help to my mother and sisters in the next room. I was finally able to jump out of my chair and run to the kitchen to tell them what had just taken place. When I turned around;It was gone and I was too afraid to go outside to look for prints. The next day,my mother went out to look for a print,but all that was left was a muddy smear from melting snow. That summer(1971),maybe June I'm thinking, I was sitting on the floor of a bedroom facing the back of the property and not toward the street. It was a saturday and my sister was also sitting indian style on the floor,but she had her back to the two large windows that were on each corner of the house facing into that same bedroom. It was approximately 11:00A.M. and sunny.We were playing with paper dolls and I just looked up for a minute to see a grey man-like creature run past the first window,around the corner of the house past the second window on the other side of the bedroom toward the front of the house facing 224th. This one was considerably smaller;maybe 5ft. in height. I thought it was a youngster. Once again, I could hardly beleive I had just seen another one these creatures that was also grey. It was terribly frightning to see something like this never knowing that something like this existed. At that tine, there had been no sightings so I had not even a clue as to what I had even really seen! I began going to my school libray in secret because my family did not beleive me. When I finally found a book on the Yeti(the only book they had on the subject), and opened to a sketch of it;It was then I realized that I had seen something very like the sketch. During the next 25 years, our family and neighbors have experienced unexplained screams, permeating foul odors around that house at night;our horses being so frightened by something at night that they would run through barbed wire fences;to being followed by something as I was walking through the same dense woods at about midnight(I had snuck out of the house to meet a neightbor)and on the way back to stay in the next door neighbor's camping trailer in their back yard(it was fenced), something big followed me throught some densly treed area through my back yard and over a 3ft. fence to the camping trailer. Within just a split second after I jumped in and locked the camper door;something started pushing the trailer back and forth so badly that I thought it was going to be pushed over. That went on for about 30 seconds and then everything went quiet. I could hear the neighbor's dog barking but their parents never came to investigate. The neighbor girl and my sister were also in the trailer so we were all screaming! It was a very frightening night for us all. We have heard screams in the summer that brought us and the neighbors out in the night thinking that a woman was being raped in the woods across the street at night. Our family exerienced something that came up to the house at night in 1975 and picked up 1 1/2 cords of split wood and threw it as far as 100 yards away! We called the police and they went out there in back of our house to investigate. Those guys were back at our door in about five minutes.They said they had found some weird tracks that didn't look like it belonged to a bear. They were scared and told us to lock the doors and don't go outside for any reason and to call them if we needed them.The neighbors setting back on a hill next to that same house experienced something walking around her house at night also.I think they are still there.I now live in Auburn past the Casino on tribal land. About 3 months ago,our neighbor was walking home from school and saw a 20 ft. tree being shaken and she said something was screaming. The tree is about 200 ft. from the fence that seperates the forest and our mobile park.There is a river and dense forest and some old growth forest directly on the side and behind this mobile park.My son is 10 yrs. old and has been hearing weird screams early in the morning when he plays basketball. The sounds are coming from the direction of the forest. This morning,March 29,2004;I was up early and opened a bathroom window and happen to hear four distinct high pitched calls or screams that I have not heard before ,but were described and audibly demonstrated on the TV show Mysterious Encounters ;A cable channel show that I watch now every wednesday evening. It was the exact same sound. I know these creatures are real! I will never forget what I saw as long as I live and I think there are more of them around than we realize. Im looking forward  to evidence that will prove these creaaatures really do exist.Thank you for reading my experiences! It took a long time for me to finally tell someone. ","I'm unsure of the year, but my mother experienced something come up to her and my father's bedroom window when it was open on a hot summer night. I remember she told me it had a horrible stench. She was afraid to look out the window so she didn't see it. There was another incident when my father was alive and we were still at home as kids. It was in April,I think and at night and suddenly the whole house became permeated with a horrible stench from outside.It completely filled the air in the house.You could hardly breath. My father got one of his guns and opened up a window, put the gun out the window and shot a couple of rounds thinking what ever it was would be frightened away. You could see my dad was really scared. So were all of us. I was crying ot of fear.",I had seemed to be the only witness to the first mentioned incident although I remember a car screeching to the stop and then accelerated quickly. My sister and a neighbor and my whole family were witnesses to the other incidents.,Over the years from1970 to 1979'my parents would here stories of people seeing Sasquatch up and down 224th for 3or4 miles crossing the road or in someone's yard.,About 4:00p.m. It was cold;about 35 degrees and had snowed and starting to melt.,The incident occured right in front of that house where a picture window looks out aboout 35ft. from the road(224th street east),unknown
53057,1933,8456,1998,Summer,August,WA,Skagit County,,concrete,Baker lake road,"we were all sitting around the campfire near lake Grandy (near Concrete Washington) off the side of a logging road. We started hearing the same noises that have been recorded from previous encounters by other people. The noise came from three directions about fifty yards outside of our camp just inside the tree line. I then shot a round out of my shotgun into the air, whatever was making the noises was not in any way affected by the loud noise of the shot.  We were all very scared by then so we packed up our things and sat in the truck listening and waiting until about 4:00 am the next morning, frequently turning on our lights to see if anything  had come out of the tree line, nothing ever came out but the noises were still loud and clear when we decided to get the hell out of there. The next mourning when we came back all of the nice juicy food that we had left out unpackaged was untouched! any wild animal would have eaten it right up when we left at 4:00 that morning. We could not pick up any tracks because of the terrain we were in. no trace of what we had come in counter with.","none of our open food had been touched, it had been left out for at least six hours before we returned. the food was peanut butter and sardines.","three, we were all sitting around the campfire.",,my son first started hearing it around 5:00 pm but did not think anything of it so he did not say anything.

My husband and I had 2 very large foot prints in our vegetable garden They were perfect because the dirt was just tilled for spring planting. The space between the foot prints was way to wide to be human. We didn't use plaster for an impression or get a picture, but we both know it was bigfoot. My father inlaw saw them too and could'nt explain them. It is kinda neat to think a bigfoot walked threw our yard right in front of our house. I wonder if they are up in the forest watching us work in the yard? We don't tell too many people because they think you're nuts. I'm pretty careful who I tell. It's been about 4 or 5 years now.

53061,1952,8597,1987,Winter,March,WA,Snohomish County," off SR2 in Monroe, ",Monroe,SR2 maybe 4-5 miles as the crow flies,"My niece was living with us at the time of the sighting.  She was a senior in high school.  Our house is about 6 miles out of town and in 1987 when the incident occurred, it was very rural, though now it has become quite developed.  The school buses didn't go down the side roads so kids would have to walk to the closest main road.  We live not too far off the bus route.  The neighbor girl drove to school and she would often stop and give my niece a ride as she was walking to the bus stop.  On this particular morning she had just gotten in the neighbor's car when about 50 yards ahead, this creature came out of the swamp area on the right side of the road, paused in a crouching position, started crossing, then dashed very quickly across the road and into the woods.  She said she turned to the neighbor girl and said, ""What the hell was that?""  To which the girl answered ""I don't know!""  She says it was about the size of a bear, brown in color, but was definitely not a bear.  It started crossing the road walking like a gorilla (she even wondered if it could have been an orangutan or some kind of ape), then it ran the rest of the way very fast on all fours.  The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet.  She described it to me as being like an ape, but also sloth-like.  I said unless there had been an escaped primate from a traveling circus, we just don't have them in Washington.  She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms.  She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound.  Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird.  It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau).  There is a ravine in the middle of this area.  To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away.  The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek.  My niece said that she and the neighbor girl didn't say a word all the way to school and when they arrived she said again ""What WAS that?"" They both were dumbfounded.  She said it gave her the creeps and she felt scared.  We have talked about it on and off for years trying to think what it could have been.  A couple of weeks ago we sat down and I made a sketch while she guided me.  Actually she had to modify and finish it because I just could not figure out what she meant about how the head, chest and face looked.  When I saw her alterations I thought no wonder she was scared.  ","Another curious thing happened, though I don't know if it was related.  At the time we had a scrappy little dog.  Within about a year of the sighting, in the middle of the night the dog went crazy barking, scratching to get out.  We let her out.  She ran into the woods in the direction of our neighbor's pond barking all the way.  All of a sudden there was a yelp and then nothing.  The next day we combed the woods but all we found was a little piece of meat that looked like liver.  We always thought it was coyotes.  The whole area was abundant with rabbits, so we thought it odd they would take a dog.  ","Yes, the neighbor girl.  She moved aboout 6 months after that.","Yes, in about January of this year I was awakened from a sound sleep around 2 A.M. to what I thought was a woman being murdered--a loud screaming.  I got up and quickly opened the window.  I was ready to call the police.  The screams seemed to be coming from down the neighbors drive getting closer and closer.  Then, from the back wooded edge of our property (which borders the neighbor's drive), I heard what I thought was a loud owl, but kind of like a peacock.  The scream was in the middle of two other sounds (howls?)  There were about 3 scream-sequences and 3 owl-peacock calls.  Once I opened the window it quit.  I listened for about ten minutes with the window open but I didn't hear anything else.   ",6:45 A.M. ,"Back then the area was primarily mixed evergreen and deciduous woods with lots of understory of blackberries, salmon berry, wild plum and other NW bushes.  There are a number of wetlands in the immediate vacinity.  We had a pond which is now dried up, our neighbor had a pond (still do) and the swamp where the creature came from was a haven for wetland birds.  Around March all these ponds are full of frogs mating and laying eggs, which ducks and herons would feed on.  There was a large amount of undeveloped land all around.  We had an orchard and many of the people in the area including us raised chickens, rabbits and goats.   The fruit trees tended to draw deer.  At night we would sometimes hear something large leaning on the goat gate, grunting and rattling it.  We assumed it was a bear. ",12
53033,1958,8670,1984,Summer,August,WA,King County,Take I-90 east of Seattle..Alpental Ski Resort..the trailhead starts above the ski zone and travels up to the treeline where it ends at the lake.,Alpenthal Ski resort,I-90,I had an experience in 1984 which closely resembles the report filed # 1385. Their report evidensed hearing a very loud scream...etc.  Back in August of 1984 I was camping above the Alpental Ski resort at an alpine lake I believe is referred to as Snow Lake (not certain this is the correct name however). It is a fairly exhaustive hike with substantial elevation gain and mileage from the trailhead. I took my brothers black lab for companionship and we found a spot at the lake near the trail. As I was setting up camp that evening I met a young couple that stopped briefly to ask for camp site reccomendations..As I recall we were the only people up there that evening.    As night progressed it got dark and fairly cold..I had a camp fire going and could see the other site a few hundred yards down the lakeside. At approximately 10:00 PM that evening I saw my lab sniff the air and get extremely irritated as if another dog were in the area. Within seconds the dog was up and pacing the campsite and acting very nervous (hairs were stanging on his back). At that same time I heard a very loud scream that was high pitched but also changed octives to a low gutteral roar at the end. This sound continued for at least a couple of minutes and then nothing was heard after.   I realize that a lake can carry sound fairly well but this noise sounded as if it were literally just outside my camp. The following morning I got up and stirred the fire. Around 6:00 AM the same couple that I met that previous night came up to me to ask if I had heard the sound. I admitted that I heard something I couldnt describe other than a loud scream-roar. The people then described to me that they heard it right outside their campsite.   As they described their experience they mentioned that the creature was passing near their site and making the sound.They could actually hear tree branches snapping outside their camp. The couple indicated to me that the 'animal' was pacing around their camp for a few minutes while it was wailing and roaring.  These people were most certainly scared by something that evening..as was I.Apparently they had'nt slept the entire night and it looked like it to me. They appeared emotionally and physically exhausted to me. They never gave their name but they made the effort to come to me and inform that they were leaving immediately and I would be 'solo' up on the lake.  I realize that there are several animals in the northwest that make various noises..mountain lions for example. This noise was nothing like I've ever heard. I have sampled the audio recordings you have on your site but they dont compare to what I heard. The screams are very similar but there was most certainly a change of octive as I described to a low roar. If instinct tells me anything this was a territorial 'notice' or noise...needless to say I left not long after the couple and havent returned since.  I would actually like to exchange any information on audio experiences similar to mine for that area. Feel free to post this if you deem it appropriate. I always wondered if that same couple may have posted their experience. Hopefully I'll get another chance to get back there..I feel privelleged to have had the experience even though it scared the H... out of me.  ,My dog was scared $#itless so was I.,definitely..however I didnt get their names.,Check the report 1385..might not be the same area but their decription is a close match.,This was approximately 10:00.,beautiful clear August night..dark with no moonlight that I can recall.,10
53033,1969,8730,mid 1980's,Summer,,WA,King County,,Duvall,,"We've been reading your reports for a long time now and decided we needed to tell our story.  My husband and I live in rural Snoqualmie Valley only 3 1/2 miles from the town of Duvall.  One night, while camping in our front yard, we were startled by a very loud moaning sound that came from up the hill from us.  It was about 12:30 AM when we first started hearing the moans.  All of us had the hair on the backs of our necks (and everywhere else) standing straight up because of the frightening sounds we were hearing.  This kept up for quite a while until we all decided we'd sleep better if we went indoors.  I think if we had thought it was a Bigfoot, we would have run inside the house immediately.  One person we told about what we heard said it was probably the neighbor butchering hogs!  I'm no expert, but I don't think anyone in their right mind would want to wake up all the neighbors by butchering their hogs after midnight.  Besides, it didn't sound like anything we had ever heard before.  We all thought--if ever you were going to make a movie about ghosts wailing--this would be the perfect sound!  On 2 other occasions within a few weeks of this first incident, my husband heard the same loud moaning through the woods at night.  Years later one of my step daughters and I had watched a TV program called Northwest Afternoon.  That day they had played a Bigfoot moaning and it sounded just like what we heard!  Both my stepdaughter and I had talked to each other after watching the program and we both agreed it was the same sound we had heard years earlier. ","One other incident happened in the summer of 1986.  My husband and our neighbor were taking the garbage out to the end of our road.  It's more than 700 feet to where we need to take our garbage so the garbage company will pick it up.  At that time we had a vapor light that gave enough light to see to the top of our short driveway.  Once they got to the top of the hill, they couldn't see a thing because it was so dark outside.  As they were walking together (carrying the can), they heard loud footsteps following them in the nearby bushes.  When they would stop, it would stop and take one more step.  They started up again and it started up walking beside them making very loud crunching steps.  They stopped again and it would stop by taking one more step than they did. My husband called ""George is that you? thinking it was our neighbor, but got no answer. They then decided to put the can down and run for home!","There were 4 of us.  My husband, and I and my two step daughters.",We've heard of other incidents in our area.

If it had been a deer or raccoon, my dog would have taken off in chase. We stood there watching for about 2 minutes. Then the figure vanished. We continued on the path to the point where we saw the figure, about 25 feet off the path in the trees, to realize that where the figure stood, there is a dropoff with a steep slope. We heard nor saw anything more. We were dumbfounded as to what it was.

Follow it to the end.,Orting,Orting Kapowsin Hwy,"Recently my 10 year old grandson, Brenden, told me of a sighting he had when he was about six years old.  My husband Dana and I had been on one of the first episodes of ""Mysterious Encounters"". My son and ten year old grandson had come over to watch the tape with us. Brenden had heard us talking about Bigfoot before but having never seen a picture of one, he did not know what they looked like.  I put the tape in and as it showed the first picture of a Bigfoot Brenden turned to me and said, ""Grandma, I've seen one of those"".  Stunned, I paused the tape and asked him about it.  He was living in Orting, WA. at the time beside a small creek, which ran parallel to the Puyallup River. It ran along the base of the hill that the old Soldiers cemetery is on. It is a wooden area with a lot of deciduous trees. Some fir, and brush.  He said it happened when he was about six years old. He had crossed the creek and was starting to climb up the hill. He heard a noise and looked up to see it standing in the woods. He said at first it stunned him but he also felt scared so he ran down the hill, jumped across the creek then looked back at it. It was looking at him but turned, walked up the hill and disappeared into the woods.  I interviewed Brenden on May 8, 2004. Here is his answers to my questions.  Did you tell anyone?   B. No, it was too freaky.  Where did you see it?  B. On hillside behind my house. He walked through a clearing from left to right, then looked at me, turned and went up hill and disappeared.  Did it scare you?  B. It stunned me but I wasn't really scared.  What did you think it was?  B. I just thought it was someone in a suit.  What time of year?   B. It was still hot during the day but colder at night.  Where were you?  B. Twenty feet up the hill till I saw it. Then I ran back down the hill and jumped across the creek and then looked back at it. It looked at me and then disappeared into the woods.   What made you look up?  B. It made a noise.  What kind of a noise?  B. Ahhheerrrraaahhhooo.  What time of day?  B. Evening, starting to get dark but still light.  How long were its arms? B. arms came to about its knees. Way longer than people's.  Was it big and muscular or tall and skinny?  B. It was big and muscular.  How big was it.  B. Oh about as big as this house. (We have eight foot tall ceilings)  When you jumped across the creek, how is it you could see it through the trees?  B.  There was a clearing you could see from across the creek. The woods were not grown up as much.  I went back to the spot about the second week of May. It is now very brushy but I think he may have had his encounter closer to fall when many of the leaves would have been off the trees. He could not remember what time of year. The hillside is very brushy and in spring at least very swampy. Fish are in the stream and it is a very shallow creek. This hillside runs from Orting all the way to Puyallup, and is brushy the entire way.  There is a recording of bigfoot sounds from Shaw Road in 1972. I lived just off Shaw Road from 1985 until 1997. Although I did not hear any strange noises my neighbor immediately to the left of my house did. Her house sat with her back yard to the McMillin Reservoir and it is bordered by the woods that run the length of the valley. She  asked me several times if I heard the strange howling, noises from back there. She was very afraid of what ever made those noises.

Things happened that didn't make much sense.  The first was while out hiking on the other side of the river, we came across two lean-to made out of branches.  One was very, old possibly years.  I say this out of the moss growing on it.  The other was about 50 feet away, and was newer,  less than a few weeks old.  It still had some leaves on the branches.  I didn't think much about it because I had to make the same thing in boy scouts.  I looked around for a fire pit but didn't find anything.  The next day myself and a couple of friends climbed the mountain across the road from us.  The girls quit after about a third of the way up but I kept on going.  After about an hour I reached a small level spot and sat down.  As I looked around I spotted another lean-to about 40 yards away.  This old had been exposed to the weather and nothing was left but the bare wood of the branches.  Still no fire pit either.  After resting for about ten minutes I started to climb again.  Thats when I heard a grunting noise. It seemed to be coming from east of were I was at.    The noise was loud, like a person talking to some one across a football field.  I tried see where it was coming from but unable to.  I got a real bad feeling and started to climb down.  The grunting started again after I moved.  What took 2.5 hour to get up took 30 minutes to get down.  I have been hunt for years now and have never hear anything like that.

The area I hunt in is 2 or  mile hike from behind our ranch. We went out late in the day to catch the deer bedding down. we set up in front of a well used deer trail. W waited for some deer to come nto our shooting lane for around 2 hours, but nothing happened. After 3 hours it was getting dark, but i was very determined that day. i happened to glance up on the hill above me, which is 500 yards to the top, and i saw a tall black somthing walking around, but i didnt pay any attention to it, i figured it was my eyes playing tricks on me. Soon after that somthing didnt seem right about the where i was at, i felt like i was being watched, my nephew told me he did to, so we headed home, which was a 2 or 3 mile hike downhill. We were probably only 3/4 of a mile away form home when we heard a big crash in the brush behind us, i never run from anything, but i ran from that crash, whatever it was. and as we ran, we could here somthing running behind us, i didnt look back, i just ran faster. this thing chased us for at least 1/2 a mile. when we saw the gate to the pasture, we jumped it,cleared it. we ran a little further and than stopped and turned around. what i saw still gives me goosebumps. standing behind he gate was a massive creature, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall. icould see it was hairy form the backround of the sky, but it was too dark to see any facial details. When i saw it, my shoulder blades and spine tingled, this tngle went al the way down to my feet, and i could not move a muscle. The creature and i studied each toher for at least 30 seconds, maybe shorter,maybe longer. it did look massive and broad,but it still was to dark to make out a lot of detail. After 30 seconds, it just tunred around and walked off on to legs. the shoulders were indeed broad, i could make that out when it walked out from under the tree it was under . it walked like a human,not a bent walk. about that time i came to my senses,my nephew came to his, and we ran all the way back to the house.    Before this sighting happened, i always believed there were bigfoot up in the woods behind our ranch. every summer i would hear them scream and moan at least twice a month, i also heard sounds that sounded like the recording Del Norte recording. I've also heard them since. the last experience i have had at night was a few nights ago, putting up the dogs, and i heard wood knocking, but only from one loaction, there were also twigs snapping up in the woods, not 40 yards from the dog house. i've also heard strange laughing sound, chukling would be a better word, like a human laughing, but much much deeper, and very loud. i have also found some footprints, but never got around to taking pictures of them, except for one that i found after my sighting, and it might not be one it just had the general shape. i have had one rock chucked atme.",see my report above.,"2, my nephew and i, bowhunting.","there are 3 other reports in jefforson county on you're website. my borther has alose seen 2 bigfoot, also near tarboo lake, and another time on Mt Zion, but he said it pissed n his campfire, so he must have been really drunk, and could have been haluucinating, probably was, but i know he really did see them 2 times before.","it was twilight when i had my sigthing, but it was a clear sky.",my sigthing was in forest. but where i hunt it is clear cut.,not known

St. Helens, for a couple of reasons, first we loved the outdoors, and secondly, me and one of my friends were hoping for some sort of sighting (other friend doesn't believe).  We started walking from a snow-park, that i can't remember the name of, but it is directly at the base of the mountain.  we probably hiked about 3 or 4 miles into the thick, old growth forest.  There was probably 4-5"" of snow on the ground, and it was a beautiful day.  On the drive up we saw several trees that were twisted about 10-12' above the base.  when we were walking, the first unordinary thing i noticed was a creek bed.  the strange thing about the bed, was that it had all the little saplings and other small trees tore down around it and woven over the water, so that you could walk across it without getting wet.  all over the woods we found more and more ""dismantled"" trees, and i thought it was very strange since i grew up in Home Valley Wa, in the middle of the woods, and had never seen anything like this in my adventures as a child.  as we carried on, we noticed a bunch of bare foot prints.  none of them looked to awful recent, because the had probably a 1/2"" of fresh snow over them, but i could still destinctivley tell what the were.  i wear a size 11 1/2 boot, and these prints dwarfed my foot, with a boot on.  the big toe on these prints were close to the size of my heel.  we tried to take pictures, but the didn't turn out very well, because of the glare of the snow.  we also had a tape measure and the largest print i remember measured out to 21""  in length.",,"there were 2 other people along with me, and they were right by my side the whole time.  we also had a dog with us",,"it was mid day, 2-5 pm, weather was clear and sunny, but cold.",it was very thick old growth forest.  ,

The area is heavily wooded, and there are no residents on the opposite side of the road from our house.   Immediately upon exiting the garage to the short driveway leading to the road, we encountered a very powerful smell. The smell was like something had died and decomposed. Upon entering the road we heard a very loud call, half animal and partial human in nature. It came from directly across the road in the edge of the woods. A second call came from our side of the road, but further down the road. That call came from the woods at the edge of my property. It was an identical call, but it seemed to be a smaller animal. The two creatures communicated for about three minutes using various tones in the calls.   My wife and I became fearful and the dogs were frozen in their tracks. We decided to go back in the house. I finished getting ready for work and came back outside at 5:30 A.M. The smell we had encountered was completely gone and there were no more mysterious calls.

53033,2026,9121,2004,Summer,July,WA,King County,"Approximately 1.5 miles east of Tinkham Campground, but still west of Hansen Creek.  Also, Tucquala Lake, SE end.  ",Snoqualmie Pass,Tinkham Road,"I had gone up to Tinkham for a solo camp before spending 5 days in Utah visiting my father.  I've given these whistling sounds alot of thought, as two of the three sounded entirely not like any bird I've ever heard - more like a person would whistle, really, only pretty loud, but flat and smooth.    The third sounded more like a bird, but the last of its three notes would reverberate all over itself - a piercing note that echoed fairly intensely after termination.   (Maybe two weeks earlier, I heard the same sound in the Upper Cle Elum River valley, up on a slope going east away from Tucquala Meadows, coming from several individuals, which I assumed were some kind of bird I'd never heard before.  But, then again, I've heard WHOOPING in the same approximate location before, only to write those off, too, as some kind of bird I've never heard before.)   The first two, flat-toned, human-like whistles (but with more ""air"" behind them - far ""richer"") were to my northeast and east.  The northeast whistle was noticeably stronger and sounded like it was getting closer.  The east whistle sounded like it moved a little closer and towards the road (south), when the third whistle began.  For about maybe 15 seconds it sounded like they were going back and forth.  Then it just stopped, and all went absolutely quiet again, save for a ground-branch snap to the east immediately after it ended.  I tried to ignore the nature of the whistles as best as I could but an occasional branch being crunched on the ground kept me on edge for about the next hour.  I didn't feel alone, but didn't feel threatened either.  I even slept in the back of my truck, under the trees.  The whistling described in report #1674 spurned me to share this.  Because ""trying to sound like birds"" crossed my mind while hearing the first two whistlings, and I've heard none of these ""bird sounds"" before.  What gets me is that on the Upper Cle Elum I was whistling back and forth with a single because I thought the way it ended was extremely impressive (piercing).  I was fascinated by how far and fast the end-note was pushed through the air by its maker.  Then a couple more joined in, with one sounding to be a good couple-hundred yards in the woods, and a couple hundred feet up the slope, but it was still plenty loud.  Hell, maybe they were birds, and maybe the last one to join in at Tinkham was a bird, too, but the other two in no way sounded like a bird, hawk, eagle, owl or anything.  This leads me to believe these all weren't bird sounds. In fact, I had no inclination to try whistling back at Tinkham whatsoever.  The first two whistles had me very much ""on alert"".    ","Before the sudden whistling back and forth, it had become so quiet I couldn't hear anything at all in the woods.  Not a peep.  Then back to dead quiet. Then over the course of the next hour, I'd hear an occasional ""crack"" of a breaking branch on the ground around me, in the 50 to 125 foot range.  This was over my fire and some tunes I'd turned on low volume, which both provided me with a sense of ""buffer"".    ",Maybe people in next camp were in tent and heard it.,"I've seen twist-snaps and a couple huge prints in the past, namely during a two year ""mission"" to fly-fish the entirety of the S.Fk.

We were walking through the field when the most earth shattering sound stopped us dead in our tracks.  The sound was best described as a ""hoot"", but delivered with incredible volume...HOOOOOOTTT!!! We stopped dead in our tracks. I knew exactly what I was hearing. Frozen, the feeling of terror was overwhelming. This lasted around 5 seconds, when the second HOOOOOOTT!! rang out. The plan was clear, we ran. Fast. As we ran, the final HOOOOOOT!! came from behind us, streaking thru thigh high fieldgrass, I was sure that I was seconds away from having my arms ripped off by a mountain devil.    I can laugh now about how I felt, but after talking with other friends who have had run-ins with Sasquach, the common thread in our experiences seems to be uncontrolable fear. Like being hunted.

I even thought about submitting it onto this site but I did not bother because it happened on an island(and I thought it was crazy).  When I read about the report(on this site) on Hartstene Island, my skin crawled and I decided that I had better do this.  I grew up on Hartstene Island. In 1984 my parents used to sell Xmas trees down in California, and I would stay at home alone for about three weeks. I was a junior in high school.  My older brother and his wife lived across the street, so I was never really THAT isolated.  We lived in a big house on a farm in an old fruit orchard,  with horses chickens and pigs.  Abby, our German Shephard was always around although sometimes she would dissappear at night, and I am sure that she was not at home with me the night that this happened because her barking would have woke me up.  And she sometimes used to go crazy barking at night, but we always dismissed it as deer, and sometimes you could hear twigs snapping out in the woods behind our house.  The woods behind our house went on for quite a ways......they had been logged off previously and so it was second or third growth that went way back, with no houses during that time.  My parents were in California selling trees.  Our house was a big one story with lots of windows.  I always felt like I was being watched at night so I would go around and pull most of the curtains shut.  Beyond the yard light it was pitch black.  Our house was shaped like a T at that time and my bedroom was on the end left side of the T with the  kitchen being kind of in the top middle of the T.  There was a slider that opened from the kitchen out onto a covered deck.  The deck had two gates, and one of them opened up about two feet from the end of one of my bedroom windows, the bottom of which was about  five feet off of the ground.  I had gone to sleep and at about 230 AM I suddenly jerked awake for no reason and looked at the bedroom window that was on the right side of my bed.  Something black was outlined and all I could really see was a head, like it was trying to peer into the window as opposed to just standing there right in front of it.  Anyhow, it seemed at the time I saw it, whatever it was realized that I saw it and it took off running off of the porch, in the process making some clattering noise(clattering noises on wood) as it knocked something over.  At the time, I thought it could have been deer hooves, but why would a deer be on our porch leaned over the fence and looking in my window?  It ran off of the porch so fast then, right around my end of the house, which meant that I heard it running through the side yard by my room and then through the back yard.  It was incredibly fast and I could hear it crashing through the woods loudly.  It was so fast that I honestly cannot remember if it sounded like it was bipedal or not.  But I seriously doubt that a deer would stand up against the side of a house to look into a window at night, that does not make sense to me. Instinctively I felt like it was some sort of animal I had never seen beofre and not human. I was so scared that I closed my eyes and prayed because I could not understand why a deer would do that, and I thought it was a person but it ran way too fast. And I  was really creeped out that someone would take off running through the woods at the back of our house at 230 AM when they could have just ran back down the driveway.....    Needless to say, I stayed at my brothers house for most nights from that night until my parents came home.",sometimes the dogs would go crazy at night but we always dismissed it as deer.

Even the crickets had stopped chirping and it was dead silent.  I dont sleep very sound the first night i am out in the woods and we all had firearms with us.  I had my 45 auto under my pillow.  Well anyway, I woke up and set up on my elbows to see if i could see what had woke me up. However, M's Chevy Blazer was parked right next to us so I couldnt see what was behind it.  Then this animal screamed at me from the other side of the Blazer.  The sound is hard to discribe but what ever it was grunted twice and then let loose with a low blood curdling scream and then beat on its chest about six times, and then it was totally quiet.  I didnt here it walk off, and believe me i was listening as good as I could.  I guess I could have stood up and looked on the other side of the Blazer and saw what it was, but I really didnt what to know.  Even with my gun I didnt feel safe, and it sounded big.  I am a hunter and have been out in the woods several times and I have never heard anything like that before or since.  No animal that I know makes a sound like that and it wasnt human.","I looked for tracks in the morning, but the ground was gravel and hard packed so nothing would have left tracks unless it was running and this thing didnt run away, I would have heard it.",No ,No,"5:00 to 6:00 am, right before daybreak.

We decided to camp at the Loup Loup pass campground which is located between the towns of Twisp and Brewster in Chelan County. It was an evening that a mild rain would occur and clear off for a short time followed by another mimor storm cell. We arrived at this campground in the mid/late afternoon. The campground had three levels at that time. The upper level was the largest and was on a large flat field. The second level was a bench with a few sites and the third and bottom level was the most remote and bordered a small creek that flowed south east. This creek bottom had very heavy brush. We picked a campsite that was away from the creek and away from the majority of mosquitos and was at the base of the middle bench level of the campground. We pitched our tent and started preparing dinner. At the time we drove in we were the only ones in the campground. Shortly before dusk we heard the first call. As we recall it was a multi-tone report that consisted of high pitched as well as deep guttural roar. I have hunted for years and this was of nothing I had heard in the past. This was not an elk, bear or cougar. At the first call our normally quiet and lethargic dog was excited and aggitated. I took him and my 45 up to the top level as the call came from our E and sounded as if it were on the top level. I got to the top within a few minutes and found nothing. There were no other campers at that time either. We were unsure of the sound but knew it was foriegn to us and was very substantial in depth and volume. After discussing our situation we decided to stay as it was well after dark. All was quiet for maybe an hr. or so then it sounded off again. Ths time it was to the S. and on our level in the brush along the creek. We decided at that point to spend the night in the car. I am unsure of the exact timing of the calls but it seems that the next one was maybe 1/2-1 hr. later. The following one was maybe  1//2- 1 hr. apart as well but the call was moving to our west and north and was moving up the creek drainage. After the third call we heard a distant call similiar to the one near us. After the close caller sounded off, the distant one did also. It appeared that the two callers were locating and moving toward each other. This went on throught the night until the two were quite close and then the calling ceased. As day broke we saw nothing. I was too cautious to enter the heavy brush in search of tracks but in retrospect I wish I had. We broke camp and left. As we were leaving we found a couple of motor homes that had camped in the first few spaces on the main level and asked them when they had come in and if they had heard anything unusual. They stated that they came in late and heard nothing. They were near the distant edge of the first level. This sound was nothing that my wife and I had ever heard before or since.

We were fishing in hip waders, my friend was about 20 feet upstream from me when we heard a sound like a huge log being smacked against a tree about 100 yards away from us, I think to our west/northwest. I think the sound of the log hitting the tree was about 3 times, whack, whack, whack. Soon after we heard the same sound coming from about 100 yards away from the first one, and the same distance from us. The area that the noises were coming from were on the same side of the stream that we had come from our vehicle from. I looked at my friend and said, ""what was that?"" He replied that he didn't know. My friend has been hunting all over western Washington since he was nine years old,  and is very familiar with the wild life here and the noises they make, I might add. We didn't think much of it when a few minutes went by and we heard the most eerie growling roar I have ever heard.

I don't know which one of us did it first, but we both ended up putting our hands up over our heads and yelling trying to dissuade whatever it was from coming after us.

I was bringing up the rear and keeping watch as we went. I was much calmer walking back. On the way back we were even joking around about it. Back at the truck I asked my friend what he thought it was. He said he didn't know, but he knew it wasn't a bear, cougar, elk or anything else he'd ever heard before.

We came in from the south, from route 147.",White Salmon,Forest Road 24,"I have had a couple of experiences in 1997 in the Mt Adams Wilderness Area. I did not see an animal. To be brief, it was in the late fall, my husband and I were camping, at about 0400 we heard a strange animal call. It was a roaring, warbling, guttural yodeling sound that included a high pitched scream element. We heard the call 4 or 5 times in succession, then all was quiet. The sound was between 800 to 1000 meters from our camp.   In this same area on a following trip that fall we found some partial tracks in a mud bank. They were just the toes and part of the ball of the foot. The track was approximately 7-8"" wide, I noticed that the great toe was disproportionately large (wide) in relationship to the other digits. The reason we noticed the track initially was not because it was so large (which we discovered on closer inspection) it was because there was patchy snow on the ground, it was raining, quit chilly, and here someone had be out in the middle of nowhere walking around bare footed. The tracks went up a muddy bank and were very distinct. I take it that they were very fresh. At the top of the muddy bank the track intersected a game trail. At this intersection I found what appeared to be a deliberately placed ""calling card"". It is a rock (I have this rock). It was out of character for the surroundings. A piece of basalt with a deposit of a white quartz-like stone that I don't think is quartz. The rock was lying in the trail, completely clean, no moss, no mud, white side up. This rock is about the size of an orange.   We have had a few other experiences that we have not been able to explain away that happened in a different location.

G. and I am 48 years old. When I was a child I used to go to church camp at different camps through Public Welfare Assistance. We didn't have much money and my mother would send me to camp every summer.    This summer was different for me for it was the first summer I was going to camp by myself. My sister would go with me in previous years. I am not sure where the camp is located other than it was near Mt. Rainier, Washington. The camp was named Camp Timberlake [now Camp Arnold]. This was a brand new camp and it was the opening summer for the camp.   The camp had Boys Town and Girls Town. There was a lake that had a dock with a slide that spiraled. The dock floated out a few yards form the shore. All the cabins were ""A"" frames with a loft for the councilors. Between the boys' cabins and the girls' cabins was the dinning hall.  I had a lot of fun that summer swimming, shooting guns and bow and arrows. The cabins were set within the fir trees and we had about eight boys per cabin. I think there were about fifty to seventy kids in camp. I was only about ten to twelve years old. (1965 - 1970)  It was about the third day of camp when everything changed. We had retired for the night and everyone was in bed. I was awoken by loud noises. The counselor told us all to stay in our beds. I remember the boy who slept in the top bunk above me - I called him Silver Tooth for his front tooth was silver - looked out the window and said he saw several large hairy men around the water tower and the cabins and they were ten feet tall. I was scared so I hid under my covers and wished it would stop. The counselor was upset and said for us all to stay in our bed and to stay away from the door and windows.  After what seemed to be hours the ruckus stopped and we went to sleep. The next morning when we went outside. Just in front of our cabin was a 30 to 40 foot fir tree tipped over and the root ball was up in the air with a hole in the ground about eight feet. There were human like foot prints everywhere. There must of been several of them and of different sizes. I saw hundreds of foot prints everywhere. They were from eight inches to maybe fourteen inches in length and depressed into the ground about a quarter of an inch. You could see the toes - think four or five -  I was pretty young and don't remember.    They took us for a walk that day around the perimeter of the camp. I remember them telling us that the girls played a joke on us and that we were going to play a joke on them tonight. One counselors said you should see the dogs here they are five feet tall. As we walked, we came to the water tower where silver tooth saw the ten foot men, and there were large foot prints all around the water tower. When we got to the lake something had pulled a bunch of algae or sea weed out and it was everywhere.  That night we played a scary record (didn't sound anything like the night before) and the counselor said we really got  back at those girls.   When we woke up the next morning they told us we were going home early and we loaded the bus to come home two or three day early.  Back in those days I never heard of Bigfoot. Later in my life the movie Bigfoot came out and I went to see the movie. When the Bigfoot came into the camp it brought me back to the night in camp and the noises I heard that night.  As an adult I often think about that night and wonder how I could get a hold of someone else who was at Camp Timberlake that summer night. I know that all the adults must have seen them and even got some photos. My older sister said that she went to that camp on Mt. Rainer and at the gate it has a sign that says the only known sighting of Bigfoot.   If you know of this sighting please, tell me how I can find more about it and maybe even visit the camp or get in touch with others that were there that night.

It was rapid short duration and deep. There was no more than 5 or 6 knocks. The sound was much deeper than the sounds made by woodpeckers, I have heard and seen these too while out there walking. The tree thumps are very rapid, I couldnt knock that fast one handed at all with something heavy enough to make that sound. The sound is also much fuller bodied than knocking a dead branch against a tree branch; the sound is more like if 4 people were to hit a hollow trunk in fairly quick succession 1 1/2 to 2 times. This first thumping was followed shortly by a second simular series of resonant thumps about 250 yrds from the first on the same side of the hill. This thumping was closely followed by 2 short calls coming from each original thumping source areas repectively on the hillside. The calls were one constant sound for a short duration, one call and then from the other location exactly the same sound. They sounded like a howler monkey in hollowness and pitch. There used to be howler monkeys just in the entrance of the San Diego Zoo of which I used to have a yearly membership. Like the thumping it was a sound that traveled far.   The other location where I heard the thumping was right outside the Chester Morse watershed which is off limits. I was again out hiking in the early morning with my dog for picture taking. No vocalizations this time, just the same rapid patting of a tree trunk.   I can't stress enough that this isn't woodpeckers, I do know that sound. The speed of the contacts wasn't as fast as a woodpecker.  I guess my question is does this ""thumping"" show up before in your experience proximity of the animals?  I know you're very busy but, I just need to know if any one else has reported hearing sounds like this or if you know what I am hearing?",,No,"I know you have reports of both Class A and Class B, for each area I am talking about.","Happened in the morning, sky was overcast bordering on rain.",Damp Northwest woods on land bordering swampy environment.,

Campground is located at mouth of St Helens trail.,Cougar,Mt St Helens Hikers bivouac,"At approx. 2 am, 35 campers were awakened to the most god awful screams in the woods. They sounded like a wounded animal and we thought maybe a wounded cougar. Others in the campground thought it may be a bear. 6 of us went to try and determine the source of the noise. We entered the woods to the east of the campground. We used flashlights to light our way and I was in lead and went towards the noise. It seemed fairly close to us.   By this time the screams had gone on for 5-10 minutes already. As we drew near the noise, which was emanating approx 200-300 ft from the perimeter of the campground, we smelled a foul smell. It smelled like animal droppings mixed with other odors. The forest around us sounded very loud with brush movement and cracking wood. We decided quickly that we needed to retreat back to the campground. I personally didnt want to have to come face to face with a bear or whatever it was.  We got back to campground and had a general agreement amongst us that it may be something unexplainable. The noise continued for maybe 20-25 minutes total. It faded off to the east with what sounded like another similar noise coming from the south. After these particular screams stopped, we could hear the coyotes howling for another 20 minutes. It was a very strange and weird experience. I have never heard anything like this in my life. I have spent alot of time outdoors and I have never experienced anything like this.

When I hit snow on a couple of corners, I started to get a little nervous about driving up any farther but still I chose to keep going. I had been seeing animals all night so I was really keeping my eyes open. When I slowed down to turn around, my car died. While trying to start it I was looking forward and noticed a large object standing on the side of the road which looked like a large man but I couldn't tell because it was out of the reach of my headlights. When my car started up the object quickly turned and strided off into the timber. That's when I knew it wasn't just a tree or anything like that. I have been up in those parts of the woods a lot and never seen anything like that. When I saw it turn away from me I couldn't calm down. I was terrified - the hair on my neck was standing up. It was just not a normal feeling. I believe I saw a bigfoot standing in front of my car along the edge of the road.",a day after the incident some friends and I went back up there. It had snowed quite a bit so where I saw the object we stopped to look for tracks but saw nothing. Everything had been covered up. About a mile up the road we saw a set of tracks crossing the road but we could not tell what they were. They were very large but it also could have been boot tracks.,I was alone. I like to drive in the hills - it helps me to relax. It wasn't my first time just driving around up there but it was definitely the first time I had been up there so late by myself.

",Aberdeen,3rd Avenue,"I returned from a two hour drive to Seattle Saturday night, after visiting family for an early Christmas celebration.  I walked onto my back porch and noticed an unrecogizable sound. Since I'm into nature observation and tracking, and had heard audio recordings of alleged Sasquatch vocalizations, this possibility was in the back of my mind.  I walked to the edge of the ravine and listened intently to the patterns of barks and growls. They were more audible than any canine and had an order to them which reminded me of sogbirds, repeating notes over and over. They didn't sound like any coyotes or elks or other fauna. I went into a slight panick at the thought of it being a Sasquatch, which I was sure it was. I ran back to my house as fast as I could and grabbed my tape recorder which I usually use for recording bird songs. I spent the next twenty minutes waving the microphone into the night air. I then went back inside to see if it was working, but found to my dismay that the battery in the microphone was dead! By the time I got it working, the animal had stopped vocalizing. Throughout this twenty minute period, several dogs gradually began barking with greater and more frequent intensity. It was interesting to contrast the difference in the dogs barking to the complex patterns of the alleged Sasquatch noises. The sounds were more structured, they had a greater range of expression and caried further through the forest.  The next day, I went out on foot to the spot and found the broken and trampled branches, the ripped tarp, the coyote carcass, the dog food bowl and the unknown animal scat. I surmised this was a form of territorial marking. Perhaps the Bigfoot picked up the items from a backyard or killed the coyote. There didn't appear to be any recent human activity there. There were no regular trails, the terrain was steep, and slippery, the nearest house about 800 feet away.   Tommorrow I am planning to return with my camera and a flash, extra film and a ziploc bag or two to collect any samples, and document the site.","The day after wards, Sunday, I went to the location where I estimated the sounds came from and found the trampled branches, the coyote carcass, the torn up tarp, the dog food dish and the animal scat.

53009,2161,10091,2004,Fall,October,WA,Clallam County,Covered in report.,"Joyce, WA",Crescent Beach Road,"Upon request of Chris Bradley (BFRO investigator) I am submitting this report of what I believe to have been an encounter with a Bigfoot or Sasquatch.  I Rodney Frank Williams (Rod) DOB 12/19/42 residing at P.O. Box 140 Joyce Washington give the following account in a sequence of events leading me to believe of an encounter with a Sasquatch (Bigfoot), according to information directly given and acquired through my personal investigation.  This happened in the Joyce Washington Clallam County area.  10/11/04:  At 0615 my two daughters Tamar 14 and Laura 13, were up before anyone else awoke, they heard a strange, prolonged noise from Laura's bedroom on the northwest corner of the house.  The bedroom window was opened but covered with plastic while the house was being painted.  Both girls were visually upset.  They said the noise came from the state forestland behind the chicken coup northwest of the house.  Immediately after hearing the noise the two dogs became very aggressive in barking.  When I questioned them as to what they heard Laura stated that it sounded like a combination of a whale and a dinosaur of which Tamar agreed.  Finding the answer comical I stated that I wasn't around 2 million years ago to know what a dinosaur sounded like.  ""like the dinosaur on Jurassic Park, Dad"".  Both affirmed that they did not hear a coyote and I was able to determine that it wasn't the bugle of a bull elk.  My wife Stella also heard the same noise thinking I was blowing my shofar.  10/12/04: The house painter returning from lunch, (he lives just behind the Joyce General Store) stated that two surveyors working at the corner of his property where it intersects Crescent Beach Road were spooked by loud, fierce growling where they were working. My house painter was commenting that the younger surveyor was really upset and the older was convinced that it was two bears in ""one-hell-of-a-fight"". The painter told me that there was a bad smell in the area. Within the hour I went up to the location to talk to the two men and found them to have left. This was about 1300. After fininshing up my business I took my Labrador (dog) and went into the forest in the general area of the reported incident. I immediatley came across what smelled like something rotten. I found no garbage or decaying carcass but did find several game trails and one main trail that leads up to the road that runs parallel to state highway 112 west of the Joyce General store.  10/13/04: At about 1100 I called the surveying company and talked to the supervisor. He told me that the two surveyors on that job had left and wouldn't be back to finish until Friday. I asked him about the bear fight and he told me that after talking to them that he believed that it was an encounter with a Sasquatch. I asked what would cause him to believe that over a bear fight, especially in that he was not present. He stated that he had encountered this type of behavior before while surveying in a remote area and once while hunting. Both times had the bad smell.  10/15/04: At 1100 I went to the area of the supposed bear fight and found the two surveyors working on the south side of the road. In questioning the older of the two he confirmed that it was two bears in a ""hell-of-a-fight"". I asked why two bears. He stated that two distinct noises from two distinct bears were making the noise. He stated that the fight was so furious that the bush and alder saplings were shaking, and that a fir tree was shaking like a twig from the bears banging themselves against it. He also stated that there was definitely a foul smell during the fighting. The younger of the two surveyors earlier stated to the painter that immediately after the fighting that whatever it was headed due south across the road towards the Olympic Mountains. He was not able to see it across the road from where he was but heard it going through the brush on the far side of the road. The older of the two then took me to the spot where they were surveying and pointed out the fur tree, which stood no more than 25 feet into thick brush from where they were standing. He told me that he wouldn't go into that bush unless he had a big gun  for protection. At about 1400 I went into the brush to inspect the fir tree and surrounding area. In cutting sign in the the area I found that the fir tree was eight inches thick eighteen inches up from the forest floor. The base of the fir was covered with a heavy coat of moss and numerous small twigs a foot to two feet long in the lower regions of the fir. The forest floor was beat-up pretty bad yet the moss on the fir tree was not disturbed, nor were any of the prominent twigs on the lower part of the fir disturbed. At about five feet up I did find one broken twig. I find it impossible for two bears to be fighting and banging into the fir even lightly and not disturb the moss or break the lower twigs and branches. I am 6'1'', 210 pounds and in good shape. Reaching up as high as I could I was able to easily reach and grasp the fir and at much smaller circumference, but barely able to shake this fir. Because of the temperate rain forest conditions that we experience the forest floor was covered with moss, and rotten vegetation making it difficult to cut sign on an actual footprint. I did find about 12 feet from the fir tree a pad print (much like a large wide human print dressed in a moccasin). I was able to determine that it was possibly a right foot because of what apeared to be a distinctive big toe. It measured about 15 inches long and was a minimun of 4 inches wide at the heal, and 5 1/2 to 6 inches wide at the top.  The heavy brush receded as I went further into a more open environment with numerous alder saplings. Here I found what I know to be a humanoid type pad print. The toes curled into the forest floor the the big tow of the right foot breaking through the vegetation and leaving an obvious toe print in the wet dirt. The print was going from east to west in the direction of the fir tree. It measured 14 1/2 inches and otherwise the same as the other print. The half-inch difference would account for the curled toe.  At 1430 I woke my neighbor form his nap (a logger) and took him to the location. He admitted to the big toe part of the print but was skeptical and said it was bear tracks. In searching the immediate area around the fir tree we found fur of which I feel belongs to a bobcat, lynx, or possible cougar pressed down into the forest floor and laying loose.  10/18&19/04: Searched the web concerning Sasquatch sighting and sounds, also read John A. Bindernagel's book, The Sasquatch. Possibly made a mistake in confiding with other local residents of my feelings of this being a Sasquatch. I have now told my neighbor and others that it was possibly a big bear in a fight with a lynx or cougar and that the prints were that of a large bow hunter in that it is bow season. With this, I am no longer looked at like a nut.  10/20/04: After finding on the Internet voice sounds of a Sasquatch I had my two daughters and wife listen to the different recordings. They each agreed that what they heard sounded like the whooing sound recorded by Dave Clevlan in a 1972 encounter in Estacada, Oregon.  10/23/04: Diana after returning home from a football game at around 2130 the night before placed two large pumpkins weighing about 15 pounds apiece next to the house under the eve. The next morning 10/24/04 when leaving for work she found one of the pumpkins had been moved and seemingly placed next to the rear tire of the van which was 25 feet from the pumpkins. Thinking that possibly one of the dogs or a raccoon had rolled it to the spot I looked closer. There was no indentation in the pumpkin indicating that it had been rolled across about 10 feet of gravel driveway. There were no teeth imprints on the stem. Diana's statement: ""I placed those two pumpkins next to the house, came inside, put the kids to bed, locked the doors, and nobody went out till I went to work the next morning."" Our driveway is 3/4 of a mile long into temperate forest. The dogs never alerted to anyhting during the night. Their doghouses are on the backsides of the house. They would not neccessarily alert to something coming out of the forest such as deer but would to anything coming down the driveway.  10/24/04: After returnig from a trip to Seattle, I went back into the area of the fir tree and cut sign again. I took the protective cover of the one distinct footprint and again confirmed to myself that it was humanoid in its nature. I took a direct bearing to the South towards the olympics and drove over to Highway 112 in a line with my bearing. Near this location I found an embankment coming up from a creek bed. On this embankment again I found what could have been a large pad print because of time and weather unable to be certain. It was in an excellent location to view the traffic and cross the road to good forest cover on the other side. In cutting sign at this location south of HWY 112 I found the terrain to be full of game trails and a straight shot up into the security of the Olympic Mountains.  10/25/04: At 0600 woke up to a noise that I was unable to identify. My daughter Laura told me that again she heard the same loud whooing sound but this time of a higher pitch and coming from deeper in the forest behind the chicken coup. I have decided to make a report of the incidents(s).    10/26/04 The dogs were very agitated during the early morning hours.  At 0630 when feeding the chickens I experienced a very horrible foul smell similar to rotten garbage.  It is hard to explain the smell except that with what I had learned in my investigation it made the hair on the back of my neck, no! the hair on my complete body stand on end.  I then realized why the surveyors would not venture into the forest on 10/15/04.  10/28/04:  Neighbors dog dragged a deerskin out from the woods.  The skin had been turned inside out as one would skin a rabbit.  One front leg was still in the hide.  Of interest was that the lower bone of the leg had been broke or twisted off like one would break a chicken bone.  Several people saw this.  Most belive that this was very possibly the work of poachers.  Of interest I found no evidence of neither a bullet or arrow wound in the hide.    NOTE:  Both Salt Creek and the Elwha River were experiencing a record large salmon run during this time period.  The top of the estuary of the Salt Creek salmon run where the salmon bunch-up before running up-stream is in good cover with forested terrain to allow predators such as bear and sasquatch to traverse and feed without being detected.  What investigation I did of the area provided no evidence of bear or sasquatch.  NOTE:  During the 1970's as a Border Patrol Agent assigned to the U.S. Mexican and an Immigration Inspector on the Canadian Border I had extensive training and experience in cutting sign or ""tracking"" illegal aliens and smugglers crossing our borders.  Also I have spent a large portion of my spare time back-packing the wilderness parts of the Pacific Northwest.  At no time have I ever run across any sign of a Sasquatch until now.

I was about 14 years old and in the Boy Scouts. My troop was from Portland, Or., and we were attending a Boy scout summer camp near Spokane somewhere....I can't remember the exact name of the camp...but it was near Spokane. The different troops lived in various campsites ringed around a lake and a main lodge. My troop had one of the furthest campsites from the lodge and the lake. During the daytime, our campsite was normally empty. For the first few days everything was fine and then things started coming up missing and evidence that someone had been going through our belongings was evident. Needless to say, one morning I woke up and felt sick. I was given permission to stay in my tent and rest while everyone else left and partook of the morning festivities. Well, I was resting in my tent and thinking about what would happen if the thing or person going through our camp showed up while I was there alone. Then in the distance I heard the voices of boys from my troop making there way back to camp. One boy was in the lead of the group and just about back into our camp when I heard him yell ""Hey, what are you doing?"" I knew I was the only person in camp and I was not visible as I was in my tent...I darted out of my tent and looked down the trail to my right and saw my troop mate...then something flashed by to my left. It was upright on two feet and all I can really say is that it was large and brown. At the edge of our camp it darted into the brush and proceeded up a small incline. Whatever it was moved with incredible speed and ease through this thick underbrush. It stopped at the crest of the hill and looked back at us....Then we being young and dumb started into the brush...and it turned and disappeared. I am not sure what I saw...I do know it was in two legs and moved quicker than any human I have ever seen, through some very, thick brush.",,Several other boyscouts saw whatever it was...I have never talk to anyone about it after I got older.,,Happened about 11 a.m. on a sunny day.

This was the couple's first summer in WA and they had out of state guests. They wanted to show them NW wilderness and took them to Hannon Lake which was difficult to get to on a beat up logging road. The couple, a brother, and cousin rowed around the lake together in a boat while others remained on shore. The boat passed in view of a cove while still in site of the shore party.   A creature was standing in knee deep water in the back of the cove facing outward but bent over splashing water on its chest the way a person tests the temperaure before getting in. Someone said ""WHAT IS THAT?"" Altogether the boaters looked to shore and the creature straightened and looked directly at them. Without hesitation or hurry it turned and walked out of the lake and into the woods. The boaters rowed over to the shore intending to see what might be found. They abandoned the effort when the boat got into murky, weed choked water. The shore was covered by dense trees and was creepy under the circumstances. The sighting distance was about 100 yds.   The creature is described as having a uniform length of thick auburn-brown hair all over except for the mouth and eyes. It was 7+ ft. in height with a massive, muscular bulk and proportional build. S. had the impression it was male due to its thick coat, no genitalia were seen. The head was oval, possibly peaked.  ","JA noticed it did not register fear and seemed ""very unimpressed by us"".

It is only accessible by one road which continues past the lakes to extensive logging loads typical of this country. The area is lowland with numerous marshes punctuated by steep round hills.

When you get to the lake [Lake Wapiki] you curve to the left of it and we camped back there a couple hundred feet from this big pond that had a lot of frogs in it.,Carson,Forest Road 24,"When I was about 10 years old my father took me and a friend camping up in Indian Heaven. We parked and then hiked about 3 miles uphill to Lake Wapiki there. It was beautiful mid August and hot. While hiking up to the camp spot I remember having a sense of someone looking at me from the forest. I do have a big imagination though so I didn't think to much about it.  We arrived at our camp spot and set everything up. We were camping next to a large dried up creek bed and I remember looking at it and following it a little ways down. Picking huckleberries and exploring the rest of the area, I spent the rest of my day just having fun.   That night, after I and my friend and Dad had gone to bed, we were awakened by a stampede of deer or elk or something. There were at least 10 because it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and they were running right through our camp. Scared the hell out of me. I remember my Dad getting up and making sure we were all right. Everything was fine and so I slowly fell back asleep.  Next morning I woke up and looked around and it looked like some of our cooking gear was scattered about the camp, probably from the stampede running right through. And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot. There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint. And i'm not talking about a human print. Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide. I estimate a size 20 and it was like 4 to 5 inches across. Huge foot print. Scared me half to death.  I was thinking about it and I think a bigfoot had scared the deer or elk into the stampede. So there is my story about bigfoot. I believe 100% in bigfoot. I know this story isn't all that. It's not like I saw him or anything but what i saw made me believe.    ",I just remember having this feeling of being watched. I grew up running around the forests of Oregon (where I'm from) and Washington and am very comfortable in the forest.

My friend along with me totally believes it was a bigfoot print.,Well I remember later on looking at this map on the area and I turned it over and discovered a story on the back of it about how the Indians in this area used to trade with Sasquatch (bigfoot) along time ago. ,I think it was about midnight - 12:00 or so.

Southeast end of lake.","Cougar, WA","forest road 26 by the Ryan Lake interpretive site, Mount St. Helens National Volcano Monument ","I had backpacked into Deadman's Lake for a one night stay. It was during the Washington bow season for elk.   As I was heading in I ran into two hunters on the trail hunting down to their vehicle to dry out and stay in their camper. They told me that a group had been hunting in the area but had to leave because there horses were acting up.   As I got to the lake I could tell that the horses had been kept in a small meadow near the campsite area. I pitched my tent in this area. I was at the lake doing a little fishing before dark when I heard a howl way off in the distance. I didn't think much of it, it was miles away. There were also several bull elk bugling in the hills behind the lake and at one point I could hear some cow elk ""talking"".   Being an elk hunter myself, I am very familiar with the sounds elk make during this time of year. That was one of the reasons I had gone to this area was to try to call in and get pictures of the elk. As night fell I stayed up until approximately 9:00 PM listening to the sounds of the woods. I could hear a couple owls hooting back and forth across the lake as I fell asleep.   At 11:24 PM I was awoken by the same screaming howl I had heard before but it sounded like it was coming from the meadow I was camped next to, about 50 yards away. It sounded like a cross between a wolf and a very loud human. It sounded as if it were a hailing call.   I opened the front flap of the tent and grabbed my light and the only weapon I had, my knife. I also grabbed the camera just in case I could see something. The howl had also scared the two owls I had heard hooting earlier that evening. The owls continued to call back and forth to each other for a time after that but I never heard the howl again.   I stayed awake for hours after that and eventually was able to relax and get some sleep. I woke up that morning to the sound of bugling elk and when it got light enough I went to look for any sign of what I had heard the night before. I found a herd of cow elk by the lake but nothing unusual. The weather started turning about this time so I packed up my stuff and headed back to my car.  ",Nothing found the next day. I tried to get back into the area but Mount St. Helens became active after this and the area was closed down by the forest service.,No witnesses,,"11:24 PM.

53059,2258,10881,2005,Winter,March,WA,Skamania County,[Specific location details have been removed from the report. The incident took place in the Gifford-Pinchot National Forest.],,,"We went camping on Saturday March 5, 2005. Excited to be able to go up to this area this early in the year. We camped at this same spot last year for a weekend. All of the wood was wet so it was very difficult to get a fire started. Cooked steaks for dinner which did us in so we went to bed probably around 9:30.   We had 3 dogs with us, it was freezing out, and my 2 year old son was all congested and not sleeping very well, so my wife and I were also not sleeping very well or much.   We estimate that between 3 and 4 am I woke up to hearing a loud howl/yell off in the woods to the East, which was to my right. I immediately woke my wife up and told her to turn the video camera on to record the audio.   [The next paragraph refers to the entire unedited recording, which is about 45 minutes in length. The one minute clip on the BFRO site is only a piece of the entire recording.]  In the audio right when the recording starts, if you listen closely, you can hear two yells. Then there was nothing for 1.5 minutes. Then it starts up and [except] for about 30 seconds, it roars and howls for the next 5 minutes. This thing sounds huge and the voice sounds like it carries for a long ways.   During all of this, you can hear on the tape, our oldest dog boofs a little. Our new dog who is nicknamed Big Dummy rolls around on the air mattress wanting to be pet and my Mother in-law's dog boofs a little bit. Luckily we were able to mostly keep them quiet and my son slept thru the whole thing. You can hear his little congested snores on the tape.  On the recording, you can hear this thing really get going. There are 2 or 3 howls where it actually sounds like it roars at the beginning of the howl. Towards the end of the incident it sounds almost like it is grunting between several of the howls.   During this all, we kept our firearms close and there was no way we were going outside. I was scared, but not terrified. I think the fact that I had the camera going alleviated some of that fear and replaced it with excitement.   We left the next day, 1 day early because of my sons cold. For some reason, my wife sure was happy that our son was sick.  I immediately checked the BFRO audio clips because I thought the sounds in the woods were similar to something I've heard before. Sure enough, it sounds just like the Snohomish 1973 audio on your site and the 1978 Puyallup audio. Another match is the 4th audio clip on your site. I have checked many animal websites and listened to all different owls, coyotes, mountain lions, wolves, bears, elk, etc. This recording matches none of these.  I have a copy of the tape that I would like the BFRO to have.  ",Nothing. I looked around a little in the forest when we got out of the tent in the daylight. Did not thoroughly look as much as I would like to have.,"My wife. She was sleeping and I woke her up to turn on the video camera to catch the audio.

Baker HWY,"Two friends and myself decided to go camping in my ""backyard"" which happens to be 10 acres in the foot hills of Van Zandt. It was getting to be later in the afternoon, about 3pm or so, and we decided to find a place to pitch a tent. By this time we were about 80- 90 feet above the house and in the woods at this old single room trailer that is left up there, locked. In the front there is a fire pit and so that's were we decided to pitch the tent. My two friends, one a guy about 20 years old, the other a girl about 17 years old decide to go and grab some wood from, just near by. Not but a minute after rounding the trailer, I hear both scream and run back around the trailer with shear panic on thier faces. It freaked me out just by looking at them. They both swore up and down they saw a very large, hairy, upright ""thing"", move very quickly out from behind a tree into thicker brush near by. I thought g at first and figured it was my stepdad checking up on us. We decided to stay anyways and within a couple of hours it was pouring rain with thunder and lighting. I did end up asking my step dad if he came out and he denies any involvment.

53047,2274,10974,1987,Spring,March,WA,Okanogan County,"Five and a half mile south on the Old Twisp Carlton RD. just above my folks house on the ditch bank, behind it is 240 miles to the next town.",Twisp Washington,Old Twisp Carlton Highway,"As I redcall, this sighting took place in the spring, March of 1987. I had 2 sightings of the same creature, on the same day. The first one was at about 3:00 AM. I was sleeping in hte upstairs bedromm of my parents home, I was in the eight grade at the time. I got up to go to the bathroom and as I would on any moon lit night I looked ou the window of the bedroom to see if any deer were on the hill behind my parents house. I grew up in the Methow Valley, which is known for its exceedingly large migratory deer heard, and I spent more time in the outdoors paterning mule deer and whitetail than I did just about anything else, so looking out to see if there were any good bucks on the slope that hadn't shed their horns yet was an every night practice for me. I remember that it was a friday night and the next day a friend of mine was coming over and he would get in on the second sighting of the creature. Any way, as I got up and looked out he window, I was drawn to a figure kneeling on the ditch bank above my house, at a distance of about 40 to 45 yards, I lived in this house until I was about 21 so I am very familiar with what is around it and what is not. I remember thinking at first that it was just the big cottonwood stump on hte ditch bank, and it finally shead all its bark, but then I realized that it just didn't look right. I then took a closer look and realized that it was an animal of some kind, but not any that I had seem before. I then took my rifle down and looked through the scope at the animal, could see very distinctly that it was what I believed to be a bigfoot, Yehti, Sasquatch or what ever you want to call it. I then took out my spotting scope and set it up on the window edge and looked at the animal for a long time, ten to 15 minutes, I then woke my little brother who was 10 or so at the time and I don't remeber if he would get up and look or not, as I recall, he did not, I then went to my parents room and asked them to come and look, and they were not interested, I to this day cannot figure out why anyone would not jump at the chance to see something like this, but no one did. I contiplated shooting the animal, and then thought, what kind of things are going to happen if I am shooting at night, at animals that most folks don't even think exist, and if I kill it, is there any huge fine for this kind of thing, and if I don't kill it, what might it be inclined to do to me if it gets ahold of me? I also didn't really want to shoot at it, it didn't look even the least bit ferocious or evil or wild. Here is where my story differs from any I have read about or seen on TV. THis animal was very large, and his color was angel hair white, almost a florescent glow, and with the full moon on him, he was very well outlined. He had almond shaped eyes, they sloped down at the outer edge and were outlined in a very silky black color, this color held true for his lips, and his nose. There were no obvious ears, though I am sure he had a set. Also, his head was very long, from chin to top of forehead, an easy 12 to 14 inches. He knelt the whole time with one knee on the ground, the other knee he rested his elbow on I can remembervery well his forearm hair blowing slightly in the breeze. His kneeling height was well over six feet and I am sure of this, because I know every rock and tree on that ditch bank and have stood in that very same spot a thousand times. That morning, probably along about noon, when my freind arrived, we rode our bikes up the road towards town and as we rounded the corner above my parents home, my friend came to a screaching halt on his bike and said what is that? I looked, and up ahead of us a couple hundred yards, on same ditch bank, but 3/4 quarters of a mile to the North was the same creature, when he realized that we saw him, he took maybe 4 to 5 long strides and traveled a distance of probably 40 to 60 yards, cleared the hill top, and I never saw him again. The color of his fur and the absolute apparent lean muscle mass in his legs upper body and arms was amazing, I figure him to be well over 8 feet tall, but not as tall as 10 feet. ",Nothing any more unusual than a 9 foot angel hair white etremely mucular and fast animal.,"1 other witness was involved on the second sighting, and we were watching bascketball just before seeing the animal.","Yes, some up aroung the Twisp river of having found foot prints in the snow after one took a guys food of his porch, and of one screaming up in th Pasayten up above Chancellor.

53031,2280,11040,2004,Fall,October,WA,Jefferson County,[Details removed],[Between Aberdeen and Forks],Mountain road off of Highway 101,"This happened during the October 2004 Washington BFRO Expedition on the Olympic Penninsula.    It was the first night of the expedition and my brother and I had been asked (as well as two other team members) to go to a location that had a recent sighting reported by [a local law enforcement officer].    The objective for the night was to walk a portion of the mountain road while making occasional wood knocks with hopes of attracting a sasquatch.  By the time we arrived at the location and prepared all of our gear it had become completely dark.  We started walking down the mountain road.  After about 5 minutes of walking we heard two short grunting sounds that came from the woods to our left (south of the road).  The grunting noises were very deep sounding, had some power behind them.    There were a few moments of silence and blank stares between us. We continued down the road, wondering if the thing would make more noise. We continued doing wood knocks as we walked.  A few hours passed as we continued to walk up and down the 3/4 mile stretch of the road, knocking every 20-30 minutes.  Then we were contacted by radio from another team that was positioned approximately 3-5 miles from us along the banks of [a river].    The river team had apparently been hearing wood knocks coming from somewhere between their location and our location. They wanted to check if it was our wood knocks they were hearing.   To see whether the river team could hear our wood knocks, we made some loud knocks and asked if the river team could hear us.  The river team asked us to repeat the knocks a few times. After a few tries they said they were not able to hear our knocks at all, so whatever they were hearing was closer to them.    We continued back up the road.  Not longer after climbing back up the road we heard what I could only describe as a scream that came from the southwest of us, approximately 250 - 300 yards in the woods.    The ""scream"" started as a low, deep moan and went into a very high pitched screech lasting at least a few seconds.  It was very unlike anything we had ever heard. We were shocked because we had hunted in the Pacific Northwest for years and knew every kind of large animal sound.  Several minutes of silence went by and we decided to proceed up the road further to where the truck was parked.  After reaching the truck we unloaded some of our equipment. We were ready to start heading back down the road again when we heard the second scream.  This time the scream was much closer, within 50 yards of us and on the opposite side of the road from the first scream.  The scream again started as a low moan and reached a very high pitched screech.  The volume and power of the scream was amazing, it made every hair stand on end.  The scream probably lasted a few seconds, but was so loud that I was expecting this animal to come through the trees at any moment.    All four stood there in complete shock at what we had just heard.  We eventually gathered ourselves and continued walking up and down the road for a period of time, wondering what was going to happen next. Nothing further happened that evening.  My brother and I are experienced outdoorsmen.  We have spent most of our lives in the woods in and around the Pacific Northwest.  We both are very familiar with the calls and sounds of all of the known animal species in the area, especially elk, deer and bear.  The screams we experienced were not any animal that either of us, or any of the others in our team, had ever heard before.  If any of us had heard something like this before we sure would not have forgotten it. We'll definitely remember what we heard on this trip.","The road was gravel so there was no way to distinguish the track impressions.   Off the road there is thick rainforest brush and deadfall longs.  The brush is threaded with big game trails. The animals trails are covered with piles of leaf litter, sticks, etc. Most of the animal track impressions are impossible to tell apart most of the time.   As we saw in many places on the Olympic pennisula, there were plenty of game trails showing heavy traffic of large animals: Probably a mixture of elk, deer, bears, mountain lions, and whatever else lives up there.  ","There were four of us in the group including my brother Jason Lawrence, Jamie Jackson, and Clifton Barnes.  We were all four together walking the road.","As we found out on the expedition, there were many other incidents from this area.",This occured over the course of several hours.  We got there just as it was becoming dark and we left the area between 11:00 - 12:00 that night.  It was a very dark.  There were a few clouds in the sky.

53051,2291,11186,2002,Spring,April,WA,Pend Oreille County,,Metaline Falls,,"  My buddy Terry and I decided to head up for a weekend at Sullivan Lake, to do some fishing, and to just get away from it all.  We got to our spot on the lake, a little spot away from the campgrounds on the south end of the lake.   It was a few hours before the sun went down. We had plenty of time to set up a tent and to cook a nice dinner.  After we had put out the fire, we both got in our sleeping bags and dozed off.  I dont know how long we were out, but some time later in the night, Terry and I were both woken up by some large crash that sounded maybe 100 or so yards away.    When we opened up the tent and got out to investigate, we both looked at eachother and asked eachother, do you smell that?  Something in the air smelled musty, almost rotten.  We both had our flashlights handy, but because of the trees that surrounded us, it was hard to see anything very far away.  We both called out to see if any person was in the area, which there shouldnt have been, with how far away from the campground we were.    After about 5 minutes of just scanning we figured it was nothing of importance and decided to just forget it.  Almost the instant we got inside the tent we heard an even louder crash that sounded like it was only 10 to 15 yards away from our site.  Terry and I both frantically searched for anything we could find to protect ourselves from whatever was outside. The best we could do was to pull out our pocket knives.    I heard something like a grunt coming from the side opposite of the door of the tent, so I shined my flashlight out of the mesh window and I saw something.  Just past the clearing of our site, I could make out a tall shape and some gray fur, on something that stood maybe 7 to 9 feet tall.  Maybe the flashlight scared it, or maybe it just wanted to investigate, but as soon as i turned my flashlight on it, it ran fast through the woods. Before i could walk out the door to shine my light on it and see it better, it was already gone.  Terry stood outside of the tent, and was shaking when i first saw him in the light.  We both decided to spend the rest of the night in my truck, and lock the doors.  We spent the next day fishing, but didnt want to have another night like the one before, so we packed up and left.

Which at the time I thought to myself it must be a Huge Bear. The following day 4-16-05 I walked about a mile down a fire guard road above where I had seen the fecies. The fog was coming in and I had not seen any Turkeys so I turned around and headed for the truck. The Fog was getting thick and I could only see about 35 yards.About halfway to the truck the wind changed and was blowing down the hill. I smelt this awful musty skunky smell and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I quickly turned facing the smell with my shotgun slung but I did not see or hear anything.Again I could only see about 35 yards because of the Fog.At this moment I felt it was the smell of a Sasquatch. Then I got to thinking about the Fecies and told myself it must be a Bear. That evening I called my Nephew because he was going Hunting with me Sunday 4-17-05.

Get out find the trail sign that says Twin Sister and follow it.  I can't remember how far it is exactly but it is between 1 and 1.25 miles in, very steep climb.",Naches,bumping road,"First off I am not a true beliver in BigFoot.  I was messing around on the internet and stumbled apon your site.  I thought it would be funny to see what sightings have happend around my home city of Yakima Washington.  When I clicked on the report form of the July 2000 (class B) hearing sound around bumping lake, I got the chills.  Let me start from the begining.  Myself and a couple of buddies of mine took off from Yakima really late with the intent of climbing the trail and spending 3 days of camping at Twin Sisters. We were going to stay at the first lake (Or First Sister).  The lake is about 8 or 9 miles past bumping lake and you have to hike in about 1-1.25 miles straight up.    When we arrived at the lake after taking way to long to climb the trail (Over confident and over packed) we set up came and got the fire going by 12:30am-1:00am.  We were exhausted and really didn't feel like drinking or anything else but eating and going to bed.  About two hours after going to bed I was awoken by some little grunting sounds.  I woke up kind of starteld but then realized they were basically a quarter the way around the lake so I just sat and listened.  All of a sudden they turned from little gruntings to a grunt/scream.  I quietly called out my friends Shawns name and he had been woken up and was listening to.  I asked him what the hell that was and after talking about it we both convinced ourselves that it was an elk or something.  I am not an animal call expert by any means but to this day when I think about that trip one of the first things I think about is how weird that sounded.  I have heard elk and deer grunts before but this sounded different.  As Ron White would say ""I told you that story so I could tell you this one."" On the last night I slow cooked some stakes over the fire coals for about.  When they were done my friends and I were enjoying them when were heard something about 60 or 70 yards out from camp.  We were camped out below the rocky base of the mountain top.  Its like the dirt stops and the rocks go up the rest of the way.  The sound was coming from the rocky area but we all thought it was a cat or bear so we got up grabbed the guns and an axe and started out with a lantern to go see what the hell was out there.  The sound was like what a rock being thrown and hitting the other rocks and then coming to rest.  It didn't sound like a little rock slide and it happen several times until we got closer, infact we had barehanded our stakes and finished them while we were away from camp as close to the sounds as we could get without climbing the rocky face, they completely stopped.  At no time did we every think it was bigfoot but we couldn't figure out what would make a sound like that?  It didn't sound like an animal that was mearly passing by, it moved to quick and to speratic(as if someone was throwing at different targets.  The only reason I look back on it now is that I was watching a bigfoot special today on the history channel and they had a gentlemen on there saying bigfoot was throwing rocks at him.  And now looking back I could definatley see how someone or something throwing a rock down twords us could make that sound.  Were the activity was would be the exact place I would be if I wanted to mess with my buddies back at camp.  We always talk about those noises and never ever gave bigfoot a chance of being the sorce of the sounds and now I just don't know.  After all this time of not even considering it now that I think of that as a possiblity it makes more and more sence even though I don't truely believe in Bigfoot.

I was between Kingston and Hansville. I was giving a friend of mine a ride home and it was very late at night. We had just past ""Kountry Kornor"" and as we approached what the locals call Maple Tree Cornor we saw a huge animal that neither of us could identify.  It was standing on one side of the road and as we approached, it started crossing to the other side.  It stopped for a moment and looked right at us.  It seemed to be a little stunned by the headlights. Then it ran across the street and jumped down a very steep ravine.  There is a streetlight on that cornor so I was able to see it very clearly.  It appeared to be about six to seven feet tall.  It's hair was light in color...almost gray.  The hair hanging down from the underside of it's arms was very long.    I know it sounds silly, but I had two very distinct impressions as I looked at this creature...that it was female and that it was sad. You know I take back what I said about not being able to identify it...the second I saw it I knew exactly what it was.  As we approached the spot where it had jumped into the woods I slowed down to see if it was still there.  The man that I was with was completely panicked...he yelled at me to speed up and get out of there.  He and I only talked about it once after that...he seemed to be completly unsettled by the experience.  I was more curious than afraid.  I did not get the impression we were in any danger.

Where it stood, I looked to the right side of the area and to the left side of the area and saw only this thing in front of me. It started to move again towards me.I saw a silhoutte of a figure it was all black. When it walk it was swaying back and fourth. Scared, I turned around and walked towards my barrick and went inside and told no one about what I saw.

To provide some size reference I put my foot next to the track. My boot is a size 11.5 (wide). It's a Vasque boot and I'm sure the dimensions are available online. Anyways, my boot was slightly smaller than the track (maybe 1/2 inch). The trail was full of Elk tracks as well. Adult Elk and baby Elk tracks were present everywhere and signs were posted about the Elk. There are many game trails that crisscross these hiking trails.   Later on we continued on the trail and we came across another foot print that was slightly smaller but it had been stepped on by someone and it was only a partial print.  Here are some details I gathered from my observation that day.   The track in the picture appeared to be about two days old in my opinion. I weigh 210 lbs, I'm 6""1 and my boot size is a size 11.5 (wide). The track had to be an inch and a half deep. I stood on one leg and pushed very hard and I didn't leave nearly (maybe a 1/4 inch) as deap of a track. Granted the moisture level may have changed in the mud causing more resistance. Also noted was the outer edge of the print and how much mud had been displaced. I also saw sharp nail marks on the toes and some say they can see it in the photo I attached. I noticed them because earlier in the day I saw a cougar track at another location and the nail marks seemed similar.

53033,2412,12510,2005,Summer,August,WA,King County,"Forested campsite  Scenic, WA.",Skykomish,Hwy 2,"Observation: vocalizations.  Hello, I am now 48, and my dad was a telegrapher during the 1960's at the former depot at Scenic.  I used to greatly enjoy spending a week at a time at Scenic with him while he was on duty, staying in his trailer near the depot, and it was a wonderful place for a young railroad enthusiast to grow up.  In later years I started an annual tradition of camping at Scenic and spending several days picking huckleberries on Tonga Ridge.  On August 24, I had finished picking berries for the day and had returned to Scenic to a little, mostly forgotten camping spot just inside the edge of a dark old-growth forest.  The southern hillside becomes somewhat steep a short distance away.  It was dusk, I was setting up to cook some dinner, and had my Coleman light burning.  A few minutes before this, two or more men in two BNSF vehicles had parked next to the tracks waiting for an eastbound freight to arrive which was having engine trouble coming up the hill (knew this from my scanner).  I could hear them talking in their vehicles.  Suddenly, from what seemed to come from up above the hillside, there was a bizarre two-second-long very loud ascending-frequency swooping cry.  I have perfect pitch so I can tell you it started around 500 Hz and went up to about 800 Hz.  This was followed by  three or four bizarre shrieks of some sort, a little higher, which almost sounded like some kind of goofy laughter, but...  I had not read anything seriously about Sasquatch for many years, and had not then ever heard a recording of one, so these sounds did not make any sense.  The only possibility, I thought, was that some practical joker was up there, had seen my camplight, and was trying to spook me.  But there were no other vehicles that I knew of, and there was no reason for anyone to BE up there on that hillside above a forgotten campground.  The intensity of the calls did not make sense, either.  I doubt if a human could have made a call that loud.  I went about my business, but as I sat there eating dinner with the light burning I had this very odd feeling that something was watching me.  (I know how silly this all sounds.)  I slept in the car as planned (doors locked).  Next night, camped near the Cascade Tunnel west portal.  On the night of the 26th, camped at the first location again.  Heard nothing, but had that same creepy feeling that something up above was watching everything.  I thought about walking up that hillside to a familiar old waterfall on Surprise Creek, but something told me, ""Not this time.""    As a Christian, I do believe in angelic protection, but after reading dozens of encounter stories in the last couple days, and reading Judy Walter's story from 1970 just tonight, and hearing the audio clips, I don't feel at ease about camping there anymore, unless I do it at the other side of the tracks under the night lights!  The difference between what I heard and most of the audio files I have heard: the latter have sounded mostly like ghastly shrieks out of some horror movie.  This was more of a pure tone at first, then the following sounds had other frequencies mixed in.  A very intense sound.  I have a question about animal scat.  While picking berries on Tonga Ridge on the 27th, I walked about a thousand feet northwest of the road where people never go, through the trees and brush, looking for a better berry spot, and saw a pile of what I thought was bear scat in an open place.  Now I'm not so sure that's what it was.  It looked similar to human, but about two inches diameter; broken in many segments; well defined, as though not having a high moisture content when deposited, and was black & grey with much fiber content; probably several days old.  I note this because you have another story in this collection about someone seeing the creature on a Foss River forest road, which is the one I go up to get to Tonga Ridge, on F.S. 6830.  I'm also wondering now if those skunky smells I encounter now and then while driving across the mountains late at night are always skunk.  ???",,"As mentioned, BNSF employees at the track, but it is unknown if they heard it; I think they were sitting in trucks at the time.",Report # 2602.,"After sunset, not totally dark.

We left to go on a night hike and followed a trail down the river, very far down the river where we found a great dark spot in thick foliage to sit and have a beer and watch the stars and throw rocks into the river. As we were leaving we could here what sounded like something following us. We all had lights but could not see anything at all. When we made it back to camp we sat in a nearby clearing and watched the stars some more.   The ladies who were at the camp reported someone throwing rocks near them and could here brush being moved around. They ignored it thinking that it was just us guys playing around. We headed back to the tents around 1am and went to bed. Before any of us were asleep that night we heard a screech or scream a few times. We all heard it. Later that morning around 3am we heard it again and it sounded farther off.  All of this sounded as if it were coming from the area were we were by the river that night.

53027,2420,12594,2005,Summer,August,WA,Grays Harbor County,On beach in front of Mariner Village (condos) about 1/4 to 1/3 mile north of the north jetty,Ocean Shores,Ocean Shores Blvd.,"I've been debating whether to report this to you guys for about a month. Sorry for the delay but what I saw doesn't seem explainable other than a sasquatch.   I was staying at a place called Mariner Village about 5 miles south of Ocean Shores. It's about 1/4 mile from the north jetty at Browns Pt.   The time is about 1:30am (I knew this because I had just left my room at 1:20 am to return to my fire on the beach). My back was to the ocean watching the fire. I turned to look at the ocean (which was about 30 yards away) and saw what I thought was a person walking south along the water line down the beach. The moon was full and when I first saw it, it was directly west of me.   What I could see was a dark figure from about mid-torso up because the beach slopes down quite a bit in that area. It appeared to be just a person out for a late night/early morning stroll on the beach.   So I decide to follow them, maybe go talk to them and start walking at an angle down the beach to cut them off. Seeing that I wasn't catching up to them I start running down the beach still at an angle in there direction.   It was hard to make out detail while running so I stopped to get a better look. That's when I realized the following, with the full moonlight I could see only it's upper body and it was all black, it had no neck, looked like it was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I start running again as fast as I could.   This thing was fast, it must have covered the 1/4 mile from where I first saw it down to about 50 yards from the jetty in about a minute and a half. I stop running and I could see it way down the beach about 200 yards away. It stopped about 50 yards from the jetty turned and faced the ocean. It was at an area on the beach that I saw it's feet turn towards the incoming waves.   It's movements seemed very unnatural and overexagerated. When it turned towards the ocean it flexed it's back like it was leaning backwards. It seemed like it was looking back to see where I was.   I know it saw me standing by the fire, I had a white t-shirt on and a shaved head, and probably saw me go after it, that's why it got down the beach so fast. It moved off and when it got near the shadow of the jetty I lost sight of it. That's when I decided to turn around and go back.   Tried to find tracks but it was moving along the water line at high tide, the waves would have covered them up. The next day I took my friend told him to go stand down by the water and stood in the spot I first saw it, I could barely see the top of his head.   Like I said I didn't report this for awhile because it's hard to fathom this happening in such a populated area. But considering the surrounding area, Oyhut State Game Refuge is very close and only 6 miles away is thick forested area to the north,one of these creatures could travel that distance easily in the cover of darkness.   Once it got to that jetty it leads to the game refuge.

53031,2449,12844,2001,Summer,August,WA,Jefferson County,,Forks,Hwy. 101,"I am submitting this is response to report #12098.  In August 0f 2001, when my wife and I still lived in Florida, we made a trip out to WA and visited the Hoh rainforest.  We hiked up a well-traveled trail--possibly the Spruce Trail--and came upon a footprint of which I still have a picture.  It was a bare human-like footprint about 11-12 inches long.  Given (a) the modest size of the footprint, (b) the popular nature of the trail and (c) the fact that there were many ""hippy"" types in the area, I assumed it was just a very casual hiker.  But I took a picture anyway, with my boot for comparison.  Upon seeing the picture in report #12098, I dug out my picture and was struck by the similarity.  Having lived in WA a few years now and having become better acquainted with what are purported to be genuine sasquatch footprints, I took note of the squared-off toes and the medially-leaning big toe.  In the picture, just above the toe of my right boot, one can see a print I made, which barely sunk in at all compared to the print in question (though moisture levels may have varied).  I don't remember much about that day beyond the huge trees.  The rest of that film roll is my wife posing beside big, buttressed trunks.  There were other people on the trail that day, which, to me, made it unlikely that a sasquatch had been hanging out there, though I suppose the print could've been made at night.  Given the traffic on the trail, however, I would've expected it to have been obliterated already.  Perhaps other people were noticing it and stepping around it too.  If I'm not mistaken, there was another less distinct track down (or up) the trail, but I can't be certain.  I've never heard of bigfoot tracks on hiking trails, which was another reason I dismissed the track.  Another possibility is a hoaxer, though you'd think they'd go for something more dramatic and attention-grabbing, like a 16 inch print.  The picture was on a normal camera, so I can't put it on the computer.  Please let me know if you'd like me to send it in.

53061,2464,12929,1993,Summer,July,WA,Snohomish County,[Beckler River Road area ; Internal database (FLATS) has more specifics.],Skykomish,US Highway 2,"The year was 1993. I was employed with the US Forest Service in Skykomish, WA on the Mt. Baker Snoqualmie NF. I was part of a wildland firefighting crew on the Skykomish Ranger dist.   I should point out that I grew up in mountainous regions and did lots of hunting and hiking all my life.  My father was a hunting guide when I was a young boy and I'm very familiar with all species of Northwest wildlife, tracks, sounds, smells, etc.  On the night of the 22nd of July, the district encountered many lighting strikes. The following morning we (firefighters) met with officials to determine what areas were hit and to find out who would be going where.   We split-up in teams of two. After reaching the end of the Beckler River drainage  I saw the smoke and the area of concern which was high on a steep, thick, north facing hillside.  Me and my partner geared up and started climbing the mountain.    The terrain was VERY rugged, steep, rocky, and thick with Devil's Club & Salmon Berry brush.  After hiking approx 2 1/2 to 3 hours through this terrain, moving slow due to the steepness, we finally reached the fire.  We worked on the fire for about 2 hours then started our decent back our truck.  We took a slightly different route than the way we came up.  We were about 200 yards down from where we had been working when my partner (Joe) slipped and dropped his shovel, it slid down the steep hill about 100 feet or so.  I offered to go down and get it for him.  When I climbed down to the shovel, it had landed on a rocky outcropping and I had to carefully scale the terrain to get down to the ledge.  When I got the shovel, I noticed a small cave entrance that had brush surrounding it.  As soon as I got closer to inspect, I could smell a foul odor coming from inside.   I shined my light inside the cave and could tell it was larger inside.  I wasn't able to see how deep it went back with my light.  The odor kept me from going any further in. I had heard of the foul odor associated with bigfoots and immediatley became uncomfortable.  It was an overall eerie feeling.  I yelled up to Joe that I had found a cave and it really stunk.  He seemed to just want to keep heading back to the truck so he continued down the path we were on before I climbed down for the shovel.  I was looking down the mountain to see how I was going to get down off the ledge and connect with the trail we were on before.  As I was standing there, I saw out of the corner of my eye, a bowling ball-sized boulder came flying from over my head.  It crashed and rolled into a ravine about 10 or 15 yards downhill from me.  I yelled back up the hill to Joe, ""Did you throw that!!?"".  When he said ""No!!"", I realized that he had already walked away from where he had been and was now way to the left of my location.    It was at that moment I realized that rock COULD NOT have been thrown by him, nor did it roll down the hill because I would have heard it crashing down from above me.  I then looked back uphill from where the rock had come from just in time to see ANOTHER rock coming from above me.  The second rock hit the ground more to the left and below me.  I was visually scanning the area where the rock had come from when I heard movement in the brush.  I crouched down and watched the area.  I then saw a dark, hairy figure walking upright along the side of the mountain, away from me.  It was always partially obscured by brush and trees so I couldn't really tell color or exact heighth, but I would guess about 7-9 ft. tall.  I watched it for a few seconds then yelled to Joe ""I see it!"", I think I said ""I think it's a bigfoot!"".  As soon as I yelled that, I looked back up and it was dead still and silent.  I felt like it stopped and hid when I yelled because I didn't see or hear anything else.  At this point I really wanted to get out of there so I side-hilled over to Joe and we quickly decended back to our vehicle.  We were both very freaked out and talked about it all the way back to the ranger station where we reported the incident to our wildlife biologist and other officials at the ranger district.  I was later contacted by someone at the U of W who wanted to interview me and have me take him to the site.  I moved from the area shortly afterwards and I never took him there.  Which is why I'm submitting this report.  I want people to know my story.",,"The only witnesses were me and the other fierfighter, we both were basically in the same general area.",, It was late afternoon between three and five on a warm and sunny day.,"The incident took place on a steep north facing mountain. The terrain was very thick with solmonberry,boulders and a heavy forested canopy. The nearest landmark would be the Evergreen MT. lookout witch is located about 1 air mile northwest.",23
53073,2470,12997,2005,Summer,July,WA,Whatcom County,,Concrete,Baker Lake Road,"Was out camping with a bunch of friends at a campground at Baker Lake near the dam. I was in a small tent in the middle of the campground with lots of camper travel trailers surrounding me. For some reason I woke up in the middle of the night and layed there trying to get back to sleep. I started hearing distant yelping sounds like the Snohomish sounds I've heard before. I also heard a lot of the camper's dogs barking. So I listened to both for a while to distinguish one from the other and make sure I wasn't just hearing the dogs. I could tell they were two distinctive sounds and not related. I listened for quite a while (hour or so) because it was so interesting. The sounds were forceful but didn't sound like they were terribly close so I wasn't scared of the tent shaking and getting a visitor. The yelping would stop then I would hear loud vocalizations like a couple of them were speaking to each other. Can't remember those sounds exactly, but thought it was very cool to be hearing these noises. Wish I had my PDA fired up at that time. Did hear some rocks being thrown around in the woods too. Didn't think it was any of the other campers because they were pretty much all drunk and sleeping by that time.   Didn't see anything.

Today as I was pulling my train out of the siding  I saw an odd foot print and thought  some one slipped and that's just a big hand. Then the train went another 100 yards over a bridge and again saw a more clear indication of what it was. Large long finger like foot with a open toes spread. I am a experianced hunter and have traveled to B.C. to hunt moose and trophy bear. In my home is a 7' black bear and this print don't even come close. I have seen a grizzly tracks in the wild. There were no claws! The train was moving about 6-7mph account coming from a stopped state. There were a total of 4 tracks. Spaced very...distant. I would see one then a ways saw another. It must have been walking down the middle of the tracks at one point. These were fresh and clean. I wish I stopped now. But,I can't stop the train and my conductor didn't believe me. I got home 2-1/2 hours ago from working over 14 hours and spent time looking on the web for a foot print and found that one from the Idaho site looked so close that it makes me nervous.

Around dusk, we heard something in the trees near our campsite.  Whatever it was walked through the brush quite loudly.  We figured it was a bear and made noise and scared it away.  Later that night, however, we began to hear some sort of scream.  None of us knew what it was, but we all agreed it was like nothing we've ever heard.  It was very dark and we decided not to try and find out what the noise was, as it was quite some distance away.  Until recently, we still wondered what we heard, but then we listened to vocalizations on this website and heard the same sounds.  What we heard was very similar to the 1978 Snohomish County recording.  We now believe that we heard at least 1 sasquatch howling that night we were camping.

We stay near Falls Creek and not in a camp ground, but up in the hills.  The nearest hunter to us is probably 5 miles away.  It is always a good time.    In October of 2005, this last hunting season, we had a stange experience.  My friend and I were walking down an old logging landing down to a creek bottom.  We were talking and weren't being very quiet.  When we got to within 50 yards of the creek, we began to here rocks being smashed together repeatedly. The sound was definitely rocks being slammed together, and it was loud.  We figured it was right in front of us about 50-75 yards away.  Our first thought was if it wasn't a man how could a bear slam rocks.  We figured they would roll them over to look for food or something and wouldn't be able to hold them and slam them together at some points 4-5 times in row.   There are no trails or roads to this creek.  You have to walk through thick timber to get to it.  Since we were the only hunters in the direct vicinity, we ruled out it was a person doing it.  We could barely see anything down at the creek from where we stopped walking cause the timber was so thick.  We walked a little closer to see if we could see anything and the rock smashing started up again.  We thought it was time to leave and as we walked back to camp it stopped.    The next morning we set out the opposite direction from the rock smashing of the day before. We went up the mountain this time, through a creek draw.  I was on one side of the draw walking the edge as my friend was walking on the other side.  The draw was wide enough to not hear each other when talking so we used radios.  About 1/2 mile from the experience we had the afternoon before my friend radios to me as says he hears something and had a unnerving feeling something was following him just above him on the treeline of the draw.  He could not see anything nor could I.    He walked down into the draw and up to my side.  We walked up the draw together about another 20 yards when we began to hear what sounded like 2 large sticks being slammed together about 3-5 times in repetition.  The higher we walked the more we heard it. We could hear it parallel to us across the draw. After a few minutes we heard it parallel to us and then right away another set of stick slamming sounds came from about 100-150 yards just ahead of us on our side of the draw.    We know we were being followed by something and there was more than one.  Afer that we turned around and left.  We left for home the very next morning.","Didn't notice anything unusual.

We had been asleep for a couple of hours when I was awoke by the smell of wet fur. I got up to go relieve myself while looking at the creek when I spotted something walking across the creek about twenty feet away from my truck. I quickly went back to my truck and tried to wake my son to no avail. While doing this I grabbed my rifle and stepped away from the truck where I chambered a round and watched until the figure stopped by a tree next to the bank, then told my son to hit the remote button to unlock the truck and turn on the bed light to shine out towards the creek.  This I did several times until I felt safe again. I could not see the figure anymore so I went to bed.    I've been hunting and fishing also prospecting for over thirty years so I know the differance between bears and what I saw in the moon light and it wasn't a bear.","No animal noises at all, the whole time we were there (a week).

My friend was in front and I was about 20 feet behind him chopping what he had missed. As I got to a big patch he missed, I stopped and started chopping away as my friend kept walking. The ditch was to my back now. Suddenly, I felt like someone was behind me. I turned around and was pretty much face to face with a bigoot. It was about eight feet away from me. My guess is it was sleeping or hiding in the ditch and just stood up to see what was going on. It could have reached out and grabed me with no trouble. I think it was just as surprised to see me as I was to see it.   It was standing in a ditch so it wasn't towering over me, but it was still taller than me. It had red hair like an Irish setter dog and a little bit matted. It had wide shoulders, the and eyes looked black, but to be honest I didn't look for very long. It took me about two seconds then I ran, and ran past my friend. He started running in right behind me asking what was wrong. I just kept yelling to keep running.  We ran all the way home.

In 1966 while stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington with the 4th Inf. Div., I had an encounter with, what I believed to be a bear, but now I know it was a bigfoot.    The encounter itself did not happen at Fort Lewis. We were on operations up in the Olympic National Forest prior to leaving for VietNam.  Myself and about seven other guys volunteered to play the enemy and try to sneak through the Company Lines.  We waited till way past sunset before we attempted to infiltrate the lines.  We were moving extremely slow, so it had to be past midnight when we were discovered and all hell broke loose.  I lucked out and was not captured.  I laid under a tree, avoiding capture for well over an hour.  When I finally made it back to the logging road it had to be 3-4 a.m.  When I got close to my Company area, I heard what I thought was another soldier coming down the side of a hill toward the logging road.  I couldn't make out any details, just the outline of a ""Big"" G.I.  If I couldn't make out his unit, I figured he couldn't make out mine, so I figured to reverse roles here and capture him.  I challenged him by yelling ""Halt, who goes there?""  His answer was this ungodly growl that scared the crap out of me and I took off running down the logging road.  Thinking it was a bear and that he was right behind me, I ran like I never ran before.  I finally saw the campfire at my Company area and headed for it.  Not knowing about bigfoot at the time, I told the guys I was chased by a bear.  The next day I found out I was the only one to escape capture so it couldn't have been any of the guys out there.    That growl was ""REAL"", not another G.I. trying to scare me.  I left for VietNam in September 1966 and got back to ""The World"" in September 1967.  I remember watching a T.V. special in October or November of 1967 about a creature that was filmed by a Mr. Patterson in the Northwest part of the U.S.  At that time it all started coming together.  Why it looked like a large G.I. coming down the hill and the real, scarey as hell growl.

We decided to take the shortcut between Neilton and the Lake Quinault park turnoff to go towards the ocean at Moclips.

This was at about 2:30 in the afternoon, no rain, clear day with sunshine.  It crossed the road a few hundred feet in front of my pick-up.  When it crossed, it didn't seem to be in any hurry, glanced breifly our way and continued as if we were unimportant.  It's stride was such that it easily stepped from the road back into the brush without losing any momentum.  I stepped on the gas to try to get a better look as this thing was moving fairly good clip but didn't seem to be running but just moving right along.  I would say it was approximately 8' tall.  I say this as I am almost six feet tall and this thing towered over my truck.  This was NOT some guy in a suit, as the area is fairly isolated and not many cars go down this road.  In fact, we only saw two more cars on that road until we reached the ocean turnoff.  It was also not a bear, or at least no bear I have ever seen to walk like this did.  It was also hunched over somewhat or didn't have any neck but gave me the impression of being hunched forward somewhat.

I probably remember this incident because I saw the man in the fur coat first but none of the adults would let me look through the binoculars.   I do remember them arguing about what it was they say. ""Can't be a man."" Can't be a bear they don't walk like that and step from bolder to bolder.""    I remember that it was at a bend in the creek west of the Mine. Big scree field on that side of the Creek ment that there was not an easy way to get over there. The Creek flowed from the South West and turned East at this bend. That is if the valley runs East and West.   The Creek was really noisy so didn't hear the men yelling for attention but did finally look up and noticed us. He turned and walked back up the creek. He walked back into pure wilderness;there is nothing to the Southwest of Holden WA. Dad is deceased so I can't ask him about it and wish I did.   I am putting this report in because my sighting was in the middle of a blank spot on your map of sightings. Sightings ring it.

My girlfriend ask me ""what is that"" I looked to see a hairy head moving along the road. I drove up the road toward the place it was seen. when I reached the place it was already gone. I grabbed my pistol and jumped out to look up the ridge in the direction it was running, nothing, no noise, nothing. My girlfriend was scared and yelling at me to get back in.   Most of the time you hear something running away or hear the hops of a deer running hard, but there was nothing. I backed up the truck to look at the road where it had run and it left no track what so ever. if it was a bear it would have left it's claw print in the hard surface sand. but there was nothing and I looked well. I could see how a big flat foot would leave no print. I asked her what she saw and she said it looked like a large man, she was sure it was a man type animal. you have to take into consideration this all happened in a matter of about 3 to 4 seconds, I mean the first sighting to stoping the car and jumping out. so it all happened fast. so you can guess that puppy was moving. and it was in a place he could not hide to well, no real buck brush or anything.

Location is edited per witness request.,The west side of Mount Rainier.,,"On this particular morning I am confident to report that I had a sighting of Sasquatch. I am a forest worker and build and mantain trails for a living. In the past decade I have had plenty of encounters of the 4 legged species, including cougar and black bear. What I saw this morning was not a black bear (though in my mind I kept hoping it was). I was within 20 ft. of the creature who leaned down under a fir limb to get a better view of me. I had been leveling an area of shale rock trail with my McCloud tool, when I realized that something was slamming rocks together on my right. My usual response is to raise my voice and yell (No bear Go Bear) and with that I usually see a quick flash of black fur and a crashing of brush. Not this time! So I picked up a lage rock yelled with more force and tossed the rock. By this time I had started slowly stepping backwards towards the Suburban, I did not take my eyes of the spot. I thought I saw something move and bent down slightly to get a look at what was moving the fir limb on the tree. I then noticed a movement of dark brown( a leg) and then a face. My adrenalin coursed, I threw my tools in the back of the rig and drove to the other side of the forest where the rest of the crew was working. They are the only ones I trust with this. Being a woman working in the woods, I get teased enough and I do not want to be the laughing stock among the rest of the employees. They returned to the sight with me and even though they did'nt see anything they felt too spooked to stay. So all 3 of us left the area.","In the past 8 yrs. I have had several experiances, all in the same area. From working with 13 people (we all left) after having logs rolled down the hill at us, to knocking on wood (green maple hitting large conifer sound) to being stalked all the way out 2.5 mi. with the knocking (which subsided at the start of the clearcut). As recent as Aug 30th at 10:00A.M. I was starting to dig out shale to place a forest sign and was answered with the knocking and brush breaking in the big timber behind me, and bipedal footfalls. I would strike the rock and then the minute I would hesitate it would start the knocking of wood (not an echo) on shale and steel vs.wood on wood.",During this encounter I was alone. I have had others with me in the past and heard knocking.

When we turned the boat around, to go back to shore on the other side of the lake, I looked back into the inlet where we heard the running. I could make out something very big on two feet standing in the shadows of the trees. It was standing up and it was swaying from side to side.

I had seen cattle in the area just prior to that but they all ran off when the chainsaw started.  No cattle in sight.

At that time the forest was owned by the Suquamish Indian tribe, but this may have changed I don't know.",Suquamish,Center Street,"I used to live in Suquamish, WA. during 1994-2002. My house was located at the top of center street in the middle of the suquamish tree farm. My family and I during those years of residency had seen and heard quite a few times what we believed to be sasquatch.   The first time I saw one was in early 1995, and I was 8 years old at the time. It was a fairly chilly overcast winter day. We had few neighbors at the time and there was noone outside, so it was very peaceful. My mom had instructed me to pick up some cans from the backyard alone. The backyard was connected to the woods. I was at the edge of the woods and started heading back towards the house when I heard something very large running in the woods about 20 feet away. I quickly turned around to look and I saw what I thought was a bear at first, but it was running on two feet and it stopped quickly as it saw that I turned around. When it stopped, it stood straight up (on two feet like a man), and held its arms and hands close to its side. Ferns were covering parts of its legs. It was about 10 feet from any trees. I got the impression that it was hoping that I didn't see it. As it stood still there, I stared at it for several seconds trying to figure out what it was. It was about 6'5"".  It was very muscular, and very hairy except for I did not see hair on the face and on the fingers. Its fur was a dark brown color.   To be honest I cannot remember exactly what the skin color was, but I think it was light tan. Its eyes were directed toward me. The facial features were very similar to human features. I remember them being a lot more human than ape-like. Its face was not course and scary! I stared at it for about 10-15 seconds until I finally figured out what it was, and then I bolted back to the house as fast as I could.   There was a few more occasions that I have seen a Sasquatch, as well as my mother and my brother. We not only had sightings but almost every night we heard branches being broken in the woods and being hit in patterns, hollars and/or ""woo woo"" vocalizations coming from deep in the woods or close to the edge of the woods near our house. We often heard the ""woo woo"" sound between 2 or 3 sasquatches (I believe).   My brother and I had gone out in the woods a lot trying to recreate the ""woo woo"" vocalizations and we would hit sticks on trees in patterns. I can only remember two ocasions that we actually got a response. The first time was when we were in the woods at the edge of our property, and we were beating a stick on a tree in a pattern of 4 strikes each. After doing this for about 20 minutes not very far away from us we heard a very large tree branch being broken off of a tree following by 4 loud strikes on a tree. It responded in with 4 strikes a few times and then it stopped. The other time was when my brother and I were in the yard at about 9 o'clock at night, and it was very dark. Jokingly to my brother I did the ""woo woo"" vocalization, not expecting a response, but about 3 seconds later near the edge of the woods that were infront of our house we heard a  loud and somewhat dragged on ""woo"" .

This potential incident happened on a deer hunt.  After seeing a herd of does, I found a buck trail leading uphill.  I followed the buck trail trying to find sign like, feces or tree marks.  I would come across some fresh buck feces every hundred yards up the saddle between Chopaka and Hurley mountain.  I saw buck sign everywhere, I marked it with a buck tarsal scent gland from a fresh deer kill from my friend.  I continued following the buck trail and signs up some very steep country with lots of boulders and dangerous rock fields.  I finally found and spooked whatever I was following; I never saw it but it stormed off over a rock field before I could get sight of it to shoot.  I am assuming it was a buck or sheep or mountain goat.  The fresh deer sign ended here and I decided to continue up, following old deer sign and camp.  It got very, very steep; I climbed approximately 2000 foot of gain to about 3/4 of the way up the saddle.  I was too tired to reach the top of the saddle, so I camped on the back side of a large tree in the midst of boulder fields.  There were many berry patches with thickets hard to pass through.  I built a soft bed for my sleeping bag and built a fire.  I saw a large pile of droppings that were black with lots of berries in it, probably bear; they were not round balls like the deer droppings I had encountered before.  I used a deer call throughout the day.  Sometime after the sun set, maybe 2 hours I heard a frightening scream come from the top of Mount Chopaka.  I had an excellent view of the snow covered peak from my slope side camp.  I have never heard a sound like this.  It was only one guttural scream.  I can describe it as a Pterodactyl (flying dinosaur) cry from a movie.  It had an extremely loud volume.  I slept with my .44 magnum ready for the worse.  Nonetheless, I didn't sleep well that night.     A week or so before this incident, me and a buddy were hunting in Chinchelo Creek of the Sinlaheikin (wilderness area), which connects to the same woods as Chopaka.  We were using a dying rabbit call and we were sitting on logs waiting for a bear to come out.  We both heard a soft yet loud hissing sound pass behind us like a shadow.  We saw nothing, it was eerie almost as if a ghost had passed behind us. I also saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye as it passed.  This was very creepy.  Neither of us have heard anything like this before.  My buddy works in the woods all day and has never heard this.","large pile of black feces composed mostly of berries, not like deer pebbles; possibly bear feces  used deer call and deer tarsal scent from fresh deer. The coordinates of the scream from Chopaka are as follows.  R24-T40-S13.  I was hiking up the valley of Hurley Creek to the saddle between Hurley MT and Chopaka.  I did not make it to the saddle because of the sheer steepness of the mountain and difficulty hiking in such hostile terrain.

This is the same place we had rock smashing and wood knocking the year before as I explained in Report # 13487.  This year we walked down towards falls creek to check out the area we heard rocks being smashed together the year before out of curiosity.  The natural trail that was formed by cattle and deer follows all along the bottom and we use it to walk the bottoms near the creek.  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet.  These trees were anywhere from 6 - 15 inches in diameter.  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well.  They were all fresh.  These were not wind falls or caused by snow.  I can tell the difference.  Normally there are a number a trees that are snapped by snow or fallen over by wind.  These were random along a trail and where there was a break another tree next to it was fine and probably more susceptible to wind or snow.  When we got to the creek at about where we thought we heard the rock smashing from the year before you could see the trail continue on at the other side of the creek as if this was where all the animals crossed the creek at.  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops.  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek.  They were coming out of the creek on a small incline up to the top of the bank.  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart.  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride.  There were 4 prints in total.  Some better than others depending on the terrain.  It was right next to the creek so it was very hard and rocky.  However, all of the prints were deeper than my boot could make.  Something definitely heavy made the prints.  What was obvious was on all of the tracks the toes were very visible and were very wide at the front and the big toe was to the inside.  Being on an incline more of the weight was on the front and less on the back however a heal could be easily scene.  It definitely was not a bear doubling up the tracks.  We see bear prints all of the time around this area and these were nothing like this. It was raining when we discovered the tracks so it was hard to tell how old they might be.  My Dad, my friend, and I are convinced there is something unusual hanging around where we camp given last year and this year.","We had a tarp set up over our generator with stakes holding it down to keep the rain off of it.  The next morning we found it with 2 of the stakes pulled out of the ground.  There was 0 wind that night and there were no prints around the generator of any kind (Deer, bear etc.)explaining that something tripped over the rope tied to the stake.  The stakes were hard to pull up too.  We all thought it was weird.","3 witnesses: my Dad, my friend and myself all following a game trail to Falls Creek.",See Report # 13487,At about 2:00 in the afternoon.

One of our pit stops was at one of our favorite lakes, Lake Chopaka where the trout are huge, hungery, and numerous.  I was out on the lake with a tired arm and a grumble in my belly so I slowly headed toward camp. I arrived at camp and fixed myself a sandwich, the time is around noon.  As I sat and ate my sandwich I scanned the lake to figure out where I would fit amongst the other anglers when I returned to the water.  About halfway through my scan, my eyes stopped on what I thought was a guy trying to get cell phone service (yes the giant phones of 1996 did kinda work at the top of the small hill) on a little hill directly across from the boat launch.  Upon further examination I thought it was odd that the person was wearing a fur coat.  At this point I went into the camper to get some binoculars so I could get a better look at the ""bear"".  Upon even further examination, this time at 12x zoom I thought it was odd that the bear had really long arms, walked on two legs just as easy or more so than myself, and had a relatively short head with ape like features for a face.  I watched for probably five minutes or so as the creature lurked around the tree line at the top of the hill, and just like that it stepped over a fallen tree and disapeared into the shadows of the trees.  Confused and thinking myself delirious from the ravenous hunger developed from a long morning of hauling in heavy trout, I placed the sighting in the back of my mind. Out on the lake again, I was prepared just incase the ""ape bear cell phone guy"" showed it's self again.  Sure enough at about 1300 (1:00pm) or so movement caught my eye near a copse of trees by a rockslide on the bigger hill across the lake.  I gave it a good look at 12x and sure enough it was the same thing I saw about an hour before.  And after about 2 minutes it disapeared from view into the copse of trees it was lurking near.  My dad asked me what I was looking at and I told him ""Sasquatch"" and he gave me a head shake and said I was crazy.  So here I am now writing to you, the only people I have told this story to other than my dad, about the 6.5' to 7' tall, dark reddish brown fur covered, bipedal, short headed, ape faced, no necked, long armed, NOT A BEAR!,  sneaky creature that I saw at Lake Chopaka on 23rd, May 1996 at or around noon and again around an hour later. ","The only thing that struck me odd that entire week and every place I went in the northern part of the state, bear activity was higher than I had ever seen it... 15 bear in several different areas all near roads.

The back 10 acres was heavily forested with thick underbrush. I could hear something very large moving through the thick underbrush and downed alder trees. Large branches were breaking like twigs. While the sounds of the trees being snapped were happening loud roars and screams like I have never heard before or since were being vocalized. I yelled. There was no response, just the same noises happening. I did not want to walk into the swamp at that point.  I listened for about 10-15 minutes. The two dogs I owned that were very brave watch dogs just stood by my side, not wanting to investigate. This was odd in itself as they were very territorial. I remember them looking up at me with a look like ""were not going in there"". I went inside the house and told my girlfriend as I wanted her to come out and listen. She said if it was what I said it was she didn't want to go outside. We stayed in the house the rest of the night and I was not scared but very tingly on my skin and alert. The next day i walked into the swamp to try to see evidence of the creature. I didn't make it very far because of the mud up to my knees and thick russian thistles. My friend came over later that day around dusk. I told him of the encounter and he asked where it had happened. I walked him to the location. When we arrived the same thing happened as the day before. The creature was still there and I was just down in the swamp a few hours earlier and heard nothing. My friend listened for about five minutes. I asked him what he thought it was. he replied,""I don't know Chuck-but good luck"". Then he hurried to his car and jumped in and left just leaving me standing there with this thing roaring. I went inside the house with it still there. I didn't feel like shooting it. It didn't pound on the house or anything like that. I never heard it again after that. I sold the 20 acres and the two houses within 6 months after the incident.

A game trail runs downhill past the spring",Cougar,Forest road 83,"I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of ""whooping"" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5"" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree.","The forest was very quiet, no bird sounds or other animal noise","no other witnesses, although there was a small group of mountain bikers 15-20 minutes ahead of me on the  trail (I was hiking on foot)",There have been many incidents in the area over the years,1-2pm,"Forested area along the Ape Canyon trail, the only ground spring I located along the trail.",5th

Baker Hwy,"On February 2nd, I went outside to get some stuff out of the truck and was listening to the night sounds.  The night was clear and cool and there had not been any rain for about a week.  So it was pretty dry.  I breathed in through my nose to smell the fresh air and to my surprise the smell I got was of wet fur with a sickly sweet smell to it.  It was almost to the point of being nauseating.  I looked around for the source of the smell.  I could not find it.  It was about 8:00 P.M.  I went back inside the house and tried to think of what it could have been.    About 11:30 P.M. February 3rd, I stepped out of the house.  There were many dogs barking throughout the area and I wondered what all the comotion was all about.  It was clear and no wind.  As I listened, I could hear the dogs at the farms down stream beging to bark.  Then at each consecutive farm, coming up stream, the dogs would start to bark.  About a quarter mile from the where I was standing, I heard the neighbor's dog start to bark.  There was a lot of noise in orchard and the neighbors trying to get their dog to come back.  It finally quieted down, then I heard what sounded like a long call, an eerie call, kind of high pitched.  It was followed up by a second call across the river.  There was a five to six second delay between the calls.  The call sent shivers up my spine.  I am an advid hiker, have been a hunter and have spent the majority of my spare time in the mountains and I had never heard a call like this one.  I immediately went back inside.    February 4th,  I was up late that night.  I could not sleep.  All sorts of things going through my head.  I wondered what I had heard and smelled the past couple of days.  Thought that I may have just imagined the whole thing.  I decided to step outside and listen again.  Down by the river, I heard a strange noise.  It was like someone taking a big rock and hitting a tree.  It sounded like ""bam, bam, bam, bam, pause, bam.""  Thought it was kind of strange to hear that.  A few seconds later, in the distance I heard another knocking of ""bam, bam, bam, pause, bam.""  I then went inside to check out this site.  I sent a comment/question out to see what your researchers would say.  They emailed me back to see if I had heard a fox.  I went through all the sounds of the foxes, then went back to the sight and heard the noise again.  This time it most matched the ""1978 Whoop-Howl from Snohomish County, Washington"".  I spoke to a few people around here and they have stated that there is activity in this area.  Last night was quiet and there were no sounds.","On Saturday afternoon, I went for a walk down to the river.  As I entered the woods from the road, I felt like something was watching me.  I walked along the fire road for about 100 yards and saw something moving down below me in the trees along the river, about thirty yards away.  Thought it might be an elk, it was big.  Now, not too sure.  It was shaking a few of the smaller trees.  Then it stopped and I think what ever it was, may have seen me.  It seemed to duck into the brush and disappear.  I continued on my walk and did not see anything the rest of the hike.  I did feel like I was being watched though.  ",No other witnesses with me.,I have not heard of anything else in the area.

53047,2834,17570,2006,Summer,August,WA,Okanogan County,At Grant lake a small Lake on the Colville Indian Reservation,Nespelem,State Route 155,"I was one of the leaders for our church Boyscout troop along for our annual week long campout high adventure. We arrived late morning July 31 at the Summit Lake Scout camp at the summit of Disautel pass located on the Colville confederated tribes reservation this is just a short ways off state route 155 in between Nespelem and Omak. I would like to give you as much information leading up to the incident of the evening of August 1st as I believe they are all related.   After arriving and getting the lodge setup. We decided to take a hike. Though we had some planned hikes loaded in our handheld GPS we decided to just pick an open ridge about two miles distant and hike up to it sticking to no trails or roads just bushwacking.   We had to skirt a logging operation which was clearing some thick timber on some very steep slopes using helicopters, to ferry the logs down the slope to more accesable sites to transport it. There was lots of fresh bear sign as there were wild Blueberries and huckleberries on the lower slopes.  The next morning we planned a hike to a lake about 6 miles from our camp the lake is called grant lake I believe? We hiked south down SR 155 to the coyote creek camp ground then to the right down the asphalt rd about a mile into an area where we were supposed to have a permit to enter.   We had the coordinates for the lake loaded into the GPS so we just went cross country until we arrived at the lake it was about 2 miles from the coyote creek camp ground. It is a small crescent shaped lake there was an old hunting camp with a tipi frame and an old travel trailer at one end.   We spent the day napping and talking and the boys swam in the lake and ran around as boys are want to do. It was a nice day we had decided to camp overnight, we had no fires as the area was quite dry. The only wildlife I noticed was a family of Lesser Scaup ducks and a family of Canada geese on the lake. No fresh deer sign there had been some cattle in the area fairly recently, but we saw no cattle.   Around dusk I decided to take a walk up on a rocky ridge a couple hundred yards north of the lake to see if I could get cell coverage to call my wife. As I left the boys were taking an old smoking rack apart and breaking the 3-5inch diameter lodgepole pine logs that it was made of against a tree most of these were rotten so they broke fairly easy but they were making quite a racket.   When I reached the top of the ridge I could hear the sharp cracks as they struck the small logs against the tree. I walked back around the opposite side of the lake back towards our camp keeping an eye out for bear as I know they would start to move around dark as it cooled down, though with the boys so noisy and it being drier at this lower elevation ( not many berries at all) I doubted there were any around. But I felt a little uneasy for some reason?? So I headed back to our camp.   As I approached the camp just before dark I smelled a musty smell like a pack rats den but stronger one of the other leaders commented yeah there is definately a skunk around. But it wasnt a skunk smell not that pungent just musty. So anyway I'm getting to the incident. We got the boys mostly settled and lights out in their sleeping bags about 10-11:00 O'clock I would guess. Shortly after they quieted down there was loud two part call with tremendous volume it was not man made it stated out lower then went to a high crescendo then followed by a shorter lower call. It did not sound like any of your recordings the closest sound I have found on the internet is the call of a male ibbon I believe some kind of Ape. It whatever it was repeated this call three or 4 times and got futher away each time the sound came from a draw at the north end of the lake where the soil was moist and there was fairly thick brush.   I spend alot of time outdoors hiking hunting, and fishing. I have never heard anything like this sound. We had to help one of the boys who had found a leech on him. This was a few minutes after the call.I asked the boys did you hear that noise. They all said yeah what the heck was that. I said I have no idea never heard it before. A couple of the boys joked maybe it's bigfoot. I never really put everything together until later when I got home and the boys comment got me to thinking about the bigfoot possibilty.   So I searched the Internet for bigfoot sounds and found your sight.  After reading most all of the accounts there are some things that many of the other sightings include.  I believe with the logging going on maybe this animal whatever it was was displaced from the thick timber up higher maybe it was attracted by the boys cracking the logs aginst the tree, and the musty smell shortly before the call. This call was very load and powerful and clear.",,13 Boyscouts ages 14-18 years and two other adult leaders besides myself.

It sounded like a cross between a person moaning, a dog howling, and a cat growling (the timbre was human-like and in human vocal range, it was a high-to-low pitch sound like a howl, and there was a hint of growliness underneath that sounded like an angry cat, but much larger).  It sounded almost like someone moaning ""booooooo"".  The ""b"" sound was faint, but definitely present.  Each vocalization was about 5-6 seconds in length, with about 5 seconds between each.  It didn't seem very loud, but it also was not faint.  I listened for several seconds, then got out of bed to peek out the window.  My front yard is well-lit by a streetlight, but I didn't see anything.  I have very bad eyesight, though, so after looking and listening for a minute and seeing nothing obvious, I went to get my glasses.  I noticed my cat was staring at the window very intently, not moving.  Normally when he hears a noise outside he will ignore it, glance over casually, or watch intently with his tail switching.  He didn't move a muscle.  I looked out the window, through the blinds, with my glasses on but still saw nothing.  Being very familiar with the noises of dogs, cats, and coyotes (howling, fighting, mating, growling, etc.), I was spooked when I could not place the sound.  The next day I also looked up sounds for different types of owls, bears, and large cats--no matches.  I went to my parents' bedroom to wake up my mom.  My bedroom is at the front of the house, and theirs is at the back (both on the 2nd floor).  I was shocked to hear the noise just as clearly from their room, echoing around the neighborhood.  From my room it just didn't seem that loud.  This makes me wonder if whatever was making the noise was really at the front of the house, or if it was elsewhere in the neighborhood and the sound carried.  By the time I awakened my mom I had been hearing the sound for about 4-5 minutes, at fairly regular intervals of no more than 10 seconds.  When she got up I told her to listen to the noise and asked her to come to my room (since I still thought the creature might be visible from my window).  She went to the window and quickly pulled up the blinds and opened the window (which made quite a bit of racket).  We saw nothing, and the noise immediately stopped.  I never heard it again that night, or any night after.  It was somewhat simliar to the Mississippi recording.  If my neighborhood were in a more sparsely populated area, I would probably be much more certain of the possibility that it was a sasquatch.",Nothing,"My mom, whom I awakened to listen to the sound.

Saw nothing, no birds, no animals, no tracks, which i thought was weird, so i was looking down at the side of the road to look on the downhillside for tracks and i saw something black move real close.  Then this thing stood up and looked at me and i stopped the truck and froze.

To liven things up a bit, and perhaps scare a few people, he and I had decided that I would sneak to the field on foot, unbeknownst to our classmates, and give a few blows on the call, which mimics a dying rabbit, while he would tell ""sasquatch"" stories.  After sneaking into position, it was dark and about 10:00pm, I hid along the edge of the field and blew the call as loud as I could.  After a few attempts at attracting attention and realizing that nobody could hear me over the loud music blasting, I was ready to go out and join the party when I heard a branch snap right directly behind me.  Armed only with a flashlight, I turned around and shined it right directly into the face of a male sasquatch standing about 10 feet away!

Rainier ","In 1982 my mom and I went out to visit my sister in Snohomish Washington. We stayed for 2 weeks during the Summer. One day my sister mentioned we were going to Mt Rainier for the day. she wanted to show us ice caves and a carving someone made in the woods called ""The Maiden in The Woods"". Anyway my mom, 2 nephews, brother-in-law, sister, and I got in their car and headed out. Before the mountain range was a valley that we drove down into. The valley was full of farms. As we drove, I began noticing these big wooden cutout siloutes of what looked like to me was a Bigfoot. They looked like those silly black bear cutouts people put on their front lawns. Anyway these were like 7 or 8 feet tall. I asked my brother-in-law about them and he said ""Oh the farmers put those out to ward off Sasquach"" Being from Michigan, I had heard about Bigfoot, but these farmers took it seriously. Almost every farm had one. It kind of freaked me out. Anyway we drove on, and started getting back into the mountains. After awhile we pulled off at an overlook parking area, this was were the ""Maiden in the woods"" wood carving was supposed to be. We all got out and started hiking up this hill into the forest. Evidently this Maiden was carved out of a huge redwood pine. We hiked all the way to it, only to find it had been vandalized and partially burned. Disappointed we all started back down the trail towards the car. It was maybe 2pm, and a sunny day. As we were walking down the path, my brother-in-law and I ended up towards the back, my nephews (5 and 7) and my mom and sister were in front. My brother motioned me to stop walking. And I did, and he stood there listening. I was like ""What?"" and he mumbled, keep walking and listen in the woods. My mom, sis, and nephews were oblivious anything was going on. So we started walking again, this time I was listening carefully in the woods and I heard off to my right, something heavy crunching an occasional stick, and what sounded like something stepping down into heavy forest bed, but it was slowly paced. My brother-in-law motioned for me to stop walking again. And when we stopped, it stopped.  This time my sister and mom noticed we were stopping, and my mom said ""What are you guys doing, come on lets get going"" and we said ""We think we're being stalked"" and my mom said ""oh yea? by what one of those Sasquash things we saw down by the farms?"" And we said ""Yeah listen, start walking"" so we started walking and after a couple steps, we heard the heavy steps in the woods again. This time my mom turned around and looked at us, and her face was white. My nephews didn't look happy either. Just then, my brother-in-law said ""Let's get walking people!"" Just after he said that we heard the most hair raising howl off to our right. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It was a weird sound too, it was sort of like a wolf howl, only it had a secondary register note to it. Almost like it was bi-octave. Like two tones, coming out at once. All I know is we didn't stick around, we all ran as fast as we could to the car, jumped in and tore out of there.  Hearing other recorded Bigfoot sounds, sort of reminds me of the sound we heard. It still scares me. ",none,"Yes, my brother-in-law, sister,2 nephews, and my mom. We were all walking down to the van.",,"Midday, it was sunny day, with sunlight streaming through the forest canopy.

If that would help. My uncle now lives there and is a stickler about people. Not very friendly sometimes.",Yelm,93rd avenue,"I am feeling very weary of doing this since I do not see them as a threat but I have had expierences with them a few times.  Once when I was nine, I was going to the orchard a mile or two away and decided to go through the woods to get there. My mother told me to keep the barbed wire fence on my right and it'll take me to the orchard. Well I didn't see a fence and went left. I walked for roughly about an hour and had a strange sensation of being watched for a while. I was watching the ground and kicking a small pebble down the trail, when I heard a snap of small branch. I looked up and the small underbrush of ferns and tall grass was moving so I went to go look at the spot thinking I spooked a deer or something. I couldn't see anything, but noticed that the moving underbrush was right next to a yellow caution tape piece in the tree. I thought nothing of it and continued up the trail. I came to a dirt hill and climbed to the top to see where I was when I fell and rolled to the bottom, twisting my ankle. I was angry that I couldn't get up yet so sat and poutted for a while, then slowly climbed back up the hill after testing my ankle. I was walking or rather crawling up over the hill to go back the way I came when I heard the brush again and felt very... not exactly scared but closer to frozen. I didn't want to see what was in the bushes and kept flashing back a few days prior to my dog getting split open by a bear. I counted to twenty before I opened my eyes and looked and there was nothing. I figured I was just being silly and to make it home as soon as possible because it was starting to get dark. I walked back slowly to the caution tape to see what I could and didn't want to see and there in the dirt was a foot print. Considering I was nine and pretty small for my age I was scared and confused. I was learning to the tracks of animals in the area and had never seen one like this. I thought it looked funny because the pinky tow was stuck out at a funny place and it was almost twice my size. I do not remember the exact time or date but I know it was early afternoon when I left home and almost dark when I got back home. But then again I also lived in and around nothing but fir trees and very liitle traffic. I did try to tell my mom when I got home what I found and that I thought it followed me to protect me, beacause I kept hearing the bushes move like there was something walking with me out of eyesight. At first it scared me and I tried so hard to ignore it but after awhile the feeling kind of toned down and I started to feel safer and not so worried about meeting the dog killing bear. It followed me right up till the time I crossed the fence to my property.  When I finally started to tell my mom after many screaming panic attacks beacuse I had been gone so long and scared her so bad, she told me she didn't want to hear about my wild imagination when I was obviously so scared. But to this day I still had flash backs and feel good at that fact that I believe many years later that I was being watched and protected in a way by a sasquatch. And I am happy that they are out there.","not that I am aware of. But i do remember having that same feeling again over the next couple of days after the incident, of being watched and protected.","No real witnesses, just a liitle nine year old girl.",,do not remember fully.

It definately wasnt a cougar scream as I've heard them before a few times.It wasnt an elk either.All we could think of at the time was that it was possibly a bear.But yet it seemed way too loud for a bear especially with it seeming to be coming from a distance.This noise went on for about 15 minutes before it faded away.I have listened to some of the audio recordings on your website and they sound quite similar to what we heard.We camped in the same spot the day before and the day after our successful climb up St Helens (awesome weather the day we went)for 3 nights total but we heard the noise only one night.",Just the strange weird noise thats all.No physical evidence,Myself and a friend named Dan Temple.We are light sleepers.We tried to wake up the other guys but they were out cold.

53007,2968,21189,2007,Summer,August,WA,Chelan County,,Lucerne,No roads up there we got there by boat on Lake Chelan,"My Wife and I Were traveling yesterday on the Lady of the Lake II out of Chelan Washington.  We were heading from Chelan to Stehekin on the north end of the Lake.  About half way up the lake we were dropping off 70 fire fighters at Lucerne.  Just as the Boat was leaving the landing I saw something large and dark walking on the shore were a creek (I believe it's called Holden creek) runs into the lake.  I saw it for a few seconds and told my wife that I thought I might have Just seen Bigfoot.  I showed her the spot and told her to keep looking while I got the camera.  She said ""I see it"" she said ""it looked like an orangatang but more upright.""  I ran to the bow with my camera.  I looked around and saw the creature walking back up into the woods it had very dark brown hair covering its's entire body.  It looked to be between 7 and 8 ft tall and probably weighed between 400 and 450 lbs.  It had long arms and a long loping gate.  I fired off three pictures hoping to capture a picture of this amazing creature.  I ran in and told my wife and kids what I had seen.  I looked back at the digital images and initially saw nothing because I don't have a tele photo lense, but later that night in Stehekin I was loking at the pictures and zoomed in on the part of the shore wher I had seen the creature and there he was!  I had started to doubt what we had seen but now I have A picture to prove it to me when I begin to doubt it.  I did not necessarily believe before this.  Nad my wife and I were definitely not looking for bigfoot when we both saw him.

53007,2982,21659,2005,Summer,July,WA,Chelan County,it was up a dirt road that wound up hillsides into woods. very close to downtown chelan.,chelan,not sure,"in july of 2005 my friends and I were staying at the caravel hotel in chelan. We were staying with a friend and his family. After the few days were up, my friend and I decided to stay another day and sleep in the car that night. That night we drove to the top of a hill through some pretty thick woods on some really unkept dirt road until we reached a small clearing. We hung out for a while sitting on the hood of the car smoking cigarettes and watching shooting stars, looking for UFO's, and listening to animal noises. We'd often hear something then speculate what it was. Then all of the sudden we heard a very loud raspy scream/roar. I immediatley expected it was a cougar but about 1 second after the screech we heard 3 deep thuds in the earth as if someone was slamming a huge tree trunk against the ground. the thuds had an even rythem like someone knocking on a door. These thuds were immediatley followed by another scream and 3 more thuds, then a 3rd scream and 3 more thuds again. after the 2nd scream we immediatly started scrambling to get into the car. We sat in the car silently, listening for quite a while. Then began speculating what it could have been. I am extremely skeptical by nature and did not allow myself to seriously consider the possibility that the animals was a sasquatch or bigfoot or some other unexplained creature even though i could not explain to myself what could have caused the scream in conjunction with the loud thumps. Trying to seem level-headed and unafraid, I just decided to go to sleep. An hour or 2 later I was awakened by my friend who seemed to be panicking a little bit. He told me he heard another sound and that we had to go. As we were driving he explained that he had to piss really bad for a while but didnt want to go outside the car. Evetually, he just decided to get out but was startled by a rustling in the bushes nearby (this time to the right of the car) and another scream (i'm not totally sure he actually heard another scream). we then drove all the way back down at 3 or so in the morning and slept parked on the side of the road. I'm aware that animals can make some pretty weird noises at night but this was just insane. the thuds were the most confusing part though. Unless maybe a 10 foot tall grizzly bear was slamming a tree against the ground? It sounded fairly diliberate, as if warning us. It couldve been a human just messing with us but we were far from houses or any good reason to be in the woods. I also really doubt a human couldve made the screaching noise because it was extremely loud and primal sounding. I never thought about reporting it because it just doesnt seem possible and i figured there HAD to be a logical explanation.  -Chase S.",i saw a deer on the way down the road. thats about it.,myself and my friend Jensen,no.,it happened between 11 and 1 its been a while so the time is especially hazy. however the other details have not changed at all.,just a forest.,16

Rainier,Hwy 410,"Well, my dad had taken me, my sisters, brother, and step mother out for a day of 'rock hunting' so that he could find the rare and odd rocks that he loves to go and find in the mountain areas. Me and my younger sister were walking along a trail that my step mother and youngest sister had just come from, they had said it was a nice trail and that we should check it out. So we did. About...a fourth of a mile towards a half of a mile down the trail me and my sister stop at this little creek, we stay there for a while playing in the water, I wanted to continue down the trail, but my sister freaked out on me, telling me that she had a very bad feeling and wanted to go back to where my dad and the others were. I told her it was ok and eventually convinced her to head down the trail a bit more, however once we started off again something charged at us from a wooded hill that was right next to me. We heard this horrible terrifying howl/growl coming towards us as the trees and bushes moved around as if a truck was coming through them. All i saw was a black figure and I started running, I yelled to my sister to get the hell out of there, me and her both cursing and running as fast as we could over the trail, now that I recall the trail was a dirt bike trail, i still don't know the exact location, it was a while ago. Anyways as we ran back I fell and hit my ribs, i couldn't run any longer and looked back to make sure whatever the hell it was, wasn't chasing us, and nothing was there, my sister wouldn't stop so i had to keep going, even though I was so out of breath I couldn't run anymore. She wouldn't stop. When we got back we were both crying and so scared that we left right away with everyone because we couldn't stay there any longer. We were to scared. I thought at the time it was a bear, or a cougar, then on the way home i realized those don't sound like that, i know what those sound like, and whatever was chasing us did not sound like a bear or cougar.   After hearing some prerecorded, suposed, whoops and howling from bigfoot in my area, it got me scared becuase they sounded so similar to what me and my sister heard",,"My sister, walking along the trail with me, we had stopped to look at a small stream, then started walking again.

53041,3012,22475,2003,Summer,August,WA,Lewis County,Between the town of Morton and Riffe Lake.,morton,highway 12,"this all started when we were asked to be night watchmen for a logging company to watch the big equipment during the summer months of july and august. it was last week of july when we got there .   first incedent we went fishing at the pond there and as we were there for about 1 hour and all of sudden we heard a strange short scream with a deep tone off to one side then behind us was another short scream witch sounded like a responce to the first scream. the sound of these screams startled us to as what this could be. my boyfriend has been a hunter and has lived in around these areas for years never have he or i heard a sound like that.  then about 15 min or so another scream back and forth to eachother while we are in the middle then about 7 ducks come out of the bush right at us as more screams were let out by this thing. we emediatly ran to the car and went to drive back to our trailor. another duck came threw the trees and flew directly into the windshield as i kept driving.  about two days latter as i was checking the equipment and making sure they were all locked up as i was walking back down the hill the sun was on the back side of this thing. it looked as though something was down in the water drinking i could here the snorkling as i was standing there thinking posible elks but because the fur seemed to be dark and long kind of a burnt red color. as i stood watching this looked to be a huge log standing up with lots of fur. i couldnt move i just froze. i couldnt scream i simply couldnt move. this thing turned and took one huge step over the top of a log on the ground i thought it was coming after me. then i finally started running down the hill to my boyfriend screams coming out of me and then screams coming out of this thing i yelled as loud as i could for him to run to the trailor. we got over by the door of the trailor. my boyfriend was still over by the car he then heard this thing screaming as it was headed toward the trees then the branches were breaking as screams and then screams down behind us we both went into the trailor. i was so scarred i couldnt leave the trailor. my boyfriend went back out side and listened it sounded as though it was done. he came back into the trailor and asked me what i saw i told him this thing it just came out of the ground. he said a bear i said no taller than a bear like andre the giant just stepping over the rope thats how big this thing was 8 or 9 foot tall easy   the following morning we went out to look for some kind of foot prints saw a couple about 4 foot split between them. the trees were up rooted some were twisted bend down twisted broken off about 7 foot up the tree .  we desided to stay. maybe we could comunicate .... we got comunication by screaming threw the construction cone witch worked almost right away. my boyfriend would scream threw the cone then about 5 min this thing would scream possably 10 yards into the tree line or just very loud. eather way it was the same screams and noises as down at the pond.  as days and nights went by my boyf would keep in contact with this thing it would answer all the time when it was close. the twigs and branches we placed in the ground scinny side pushed into the ground the trees were not the branches of the trees around pushed into the ground.  we then saw stumps that were completely surrounded by branches and branches weeved into trees and looked to beds we found hand prints where the beds were we found hair trapped into the ground like a straw bed.   other things were happening also but i would like to talk to someone about this ordeal i still have nightmares about this please if you read my story contact me thank you  Investigators Addition  The following is a narrative based on an interview with the witnesses at their home on 3/15/08.  The witnesses arrived at the logging site on July 20th 2003.  Their job was night watchmen over the logging equipment.  It was their responsibility. They were on duty all night. They were off duty during the daylight hours while the equipment was being used.  First Site: The first location is where most of the activity occurred.  From the gate the pond is three miles up the road on what they call the Main Line.  The trailer was parked a mile further down the road beyond the pond.  A large clear cut was on the north side of the trailer site.  A road ran north through the clear cut, bending to the east about in the middle.  A spur road extended north from the bend in the road and ended at the tree line.  First encounter  The pond.   Date: August 1st Time: Dusk Moon: New  The couple was fishing at the pond in the late afternoon.  They had been fishing for about an hour when suddenly the first creature screamed, then in a few seconds the second creature screamed.  It was just getting dark.  The witnesses could not see what they were, but said that the creatures were only about 40 yards to each side of them.  The first creature was across the pond to the right side, and the second creature was on their side to their left.  The second creature was just beyond where they parked their car.   Not knowing what it was that was screaming, they became afraid and decided to leave.  As they were rapidly trying to get to the car, a flock of ducks was flushed from the brush at the end of the pond where the first creature screamed from.  The ducks were very spooked.  The witnesses jumped into their car and began to head towards their trailer when two very frightened ducks rocketed through the timber between the pond and the road and one actually collided with the drivers side mirror of their car.    Second Encounter  Eyes in the clear cut. Date: August 2nd Time: 12:00-1:00AM Moon: New Location: Up in the clear cut, near the logging equipment, which was parked about halfway between the road and the tree line along the right side of the spur road.  Later that night, (after the encounter at the pond) they walked up the road into the clear-cut to check on the equipment.  They took a laser light pen with them.  After checking the equipment to make sure it was locked up, they were looking to see what might be out in the clear cut (like deer, elk, bear, etc.), when they saw three sets of red colored eyes close to the ground, in the open,  just to the left of the spur road.  The eyes moved from the left of the road up, onto the road.  When the witnesses shined the laser light on the creatures, the eyes seemed to bob and weave trying to duck away from the laser light. The creatures stayed close to the ground, with one set almost on the ground, and the other two higher up.  When the laser light hit the creatures, they could see hair about four inches long.  Then one set of eyes rose up to be about six feet above the road. They assumed it stood up.  Then all three creatures turned and walked away, up the spur road to the tree line.    At the tree line, they turned left and headed down through the trees. The witnesses said that they could hear branches breaking as they walked. They could also hear vocalizations periodically. It sounded like two people who were very annoyed, and complaining. The screams were short vocalizations, like shouts, and were exactly the same as they heard near the pond. That ended the second encounter.   Third Encounter - Whistling, Date: August 2nd   Moon: New Time: Late afternoon to dusk Location: Halfway between the pond and their trailer, on the north side of the main-line road.  The next day, the witnesses decided to take a walk.  It was late afternoon.  They walked from their trailer back towards the pond and then went up a cat road for a distance. They then turned around because it was getting dark. The boyfriend was getting an uneasy feeling about the situation.    As they were walking out, they began to hear a flute like whistle.  When they would stop to listen, the whistle would stop.  When they started to walk again, the whistle would start up again.  What was making the whistling sound followed them all the way back to the main road.  They could not identify what was making the sound.    Fourth Encounter  The little one Date: August  6th Time: 11:30 PM Moon: ½ full Location: At the creek which ran down from the clear cut and past the trailer.  The female witness went to get water from the creek.  She was up in the clear cut a short distance, at a place on the creek where it was easy to fill up the water jugs.  She was crouching down filling up her water jugs when she looked up and saw two yellowish looking eyes framed by black, shiny skin.  She could see the eyes, nose, cheeks, and forehead.  It was five feet away,but down on the ground, looking up at her.  She said softly, You stay right there., and backed away.  She went to get her boyfriend.  When they came back a few minutes later the creature was gone.    Fifth Encounter  The big one Date: August  7th Time: Dusk, 10:00 PM Moon: A little more than ½ full Location: In the clear cut, at the head of the little stream that flowed out of the clear cut and past the trailer.    The next night, just at dusk, they could still see well enough to work on their car, which was having problems.  It was about 10:00 PM. There were big black bees that kept them inside the trailer during the day, so they went back out after the bees went away to work on the car.  The female witness walked up the road leading into to clear cut to check on the logging equipment and make sure that the doors were all closed and locked.  Having done that, she was walking back towards the trailer, when she heard this snorkeling sound over by the creek.  She walked over to take a look at what might be there and saw this big, fur covered butt about 60-70 feet away. At first she thought it might be a bear or an elk.  It was on its knees, bending forward, drinking from the creek.  Then it stood up as if in slow motion.  She said that it looked like a big stump just growing out of the ground.  Then it stepped over a 3 foot high stump.  She said the creature was 8-9 feet tall, and moved like Andre the Giant stepping into a wrestling ring.  She said the hair was a burnt red color with gray tips.  She then ran in fear down towards the trailer, screaming as she ran. She stated that she didnt know if it was chasing her or not, but she could hear it screaming also.   Her boyfriend, hearing her, walked across the road to see what was going on. He said that the creature was moving away, screaming. He said that it threw a fit up in the trees.  It was yelling and screaming, breaking trees and branches.  The screaming was the same sound as they heard down by the pond. This was the first time they realized what they were encountering.   Sixth Encounter  Tree breaking Date: August 8th Time: Approximately midnight Moon: A little more than half full Location: 40 yards from the trailer.  The same night they saw the big one in the clear cut, they went out to get water from the creek, but stayed close to the trailer, within 40 yards.  They wanted to be close enough to run to safety if necessary.  While getting water, they heard a creature walking in the woods close by.  The boyfriend threw some rocks in the direction of the sounds.  The creature reacted to the rock throwing by violently shaking a small tree.  It shook the tree so hard that it fell over.  This scared the witness, so he fired his one shot into the air to scare the creature away, and yelled, Stay away!  At this, the creature went silent and walked away.  After the shot, the male creature made a call from above and behind them in the clear cut.  By this time, they could identify the two individuals by the sound of their voices.  The male makes a louder, deeper call.  The female voice is higher pitched, not as loud as the male, and has a distinctive short howling sound she makes at the end of her vocalizations.   After the 5th and 6th encounters, they started walking in the woods during the day, looking for tracks. They found impressions in the moss which were quite large.  The interesting thing about the impressions is that there would be a deep heel print, then an undisturbed space, then the front of the foot.  The stride was 4 ½ feet.  At one muddy bank, the found a track where the sasquatch tried to step up the bank, but its foot slipped and made a long five toed slide mark in the mud.    They began to find stick structures in the shape of tripods and tee-pees.  There were large ones and very small ones.  The interesting thing is that the structures were made with the tips of the poles inserted into the ground and the root end up in the air.  They found lines of single poles stuck in the ground, tip end down, like trail markers. They found lean-to type structures made against a large tree, and there was what appeared to be a sleeping nest under it.  Inside they found hair, which looks like elk hair, and a full hand print.  The hand print was close to human proportions but dinner-plate large.  They found a log laying on the ground that had sticks arranged leaning on the log at even intervals.    The couple constructed their own tee-pee near where they found the stick structures and the sleeping nest.  The idea was to make a structure as a blind, and then hide out in it at night to see what might show up.  They leaned poles up against the side of a big stump and lodged the lower ends into the stump roots.  Then they wove sticks horizontally.  They spent several hours that night inside this blind.    After a few hours, with nothing happening, they decided to go back to the trailer.  They said, I wonder what the sasquatches will think of our structure.  As they were walking away, they heard one of the sasquatches hoot at them.  They were being watched the whole time.  The next day, they went back to check on their structure, and found it disassembled, and the sticks neatly stacked in three piles.  Later, they decided to try to mimic the calls they were hearing.  They used a construction cone as a megaphone, and by making a call while sucking in air, the male witness was able to imitate the calls.  When he called, the creatures would almost always answer.    This interaction continued intermittently until the end of August.  The creatures seemed curious about them and hung around at each of the three locations where they camped.  They would hear vocalizations from time to time. They said that it would be what they called the squawk call, and sometimes there would be wood-knocks or rock-clacking.  They heard both the male and female.   The couple was stationed at the first logging site for about one month before being moved to the next logging site about a mile away. This move happened around the first of September.   Second site. The couple stayed at the second site for about three weeks.  During this time, they would hear heavy, raspy, breathing from time to time as one of the creatures walked by their trailer.  There was a lot of human activity at this time.  The sasquatches curious about them, but left them alone.   Third site. They stayed at the third site for two weeks. At this site, they explored the woods around the area.  They found stick structures, impressions, and the beds.  The end.  The third week of September, they told the logging crew boss about what they had seen and experienced. He was not surprised, but said, Dont tell anybody!.  He said that they were afraid that if it was proven that there really were sasquatches then the woods would be closed to logging.    The next day, the witnesses were fired.  They were told that their services were no longer required.  This was supposed to be a six month job. Three days later, while they were in town, the logging company pulled their trailer out of the woods and left it by the highway.

I remember the day because I work earlier on Sunday's than the rest of the week. It was November, 2007.  I was up a little before 5AM and then let the dog out to do his thing.    What I heard when I got outside was alarming. It was a howl or moan coming from some distance away.  My dog doesn't care when he hears other dog's howl or bark, but this got his interest.  I have heard cougar and coyotes howl, that wasn't it.    I had heard this sometime ago when I started to research sasquatch, I came across a howl or moan from Westmoreland, PA. It sounded very similar. This is why it creeped me out.  It went on for about 10 minutes, then I had to go back inside to get ready for work.  When I came out again about 30 minutes later it started again, but in short bursts.  I wished I had some type of recording device.  I have listened for the same noise every morning since and haven't heard it again. ","Yes, I had another incident, about a year prior, I had explained what had happened to a BFRO researcher before.  This happened I believe in October, November of 2006.  I was walking my dog, the area consists of a paved road, and on either side there is pretty dense woods, homes scattered the area, except our community which is a standard planned community.  It was early in the morning, still dark, around 7, walking past this area like I had done many times before. My wife and I had moved into the area June of 2006.  My dog was acting funny staring at this one location, I didn't see anything back in the woods.   I believe it was early enough where I had to bring my flashlight. I scanned the area, when I did this I heard a loud pop, like you do when you bend down a sapling and let it go, but 10 times louder, then a lot of brush moving, then I heard running, something running through the woods.  I have fished all over washington, and I have heard dear, and seen bear and have some knowledge of the outdoors, it sounded to me like something was running fast and on two legs.

I am an avid outdoorsman that has hiked from Mexico to Canada.  I have always believed that there is bigfoots running around.

As I approached the creek I saw a large footprint.  The hair on my neck stood up.  I looked at the other side of the creek and their was another large track.  Not bear, not lion- like nothing I have seen before or since. I got a little spooked because the tracks looked quite fresh.  As I broke back through the alder on the way back to the car I sensed something looking at me.  Very scary, like I was being followed.  I got within 30 feet of my ride and heard breathing coming behind me but no footsteps.  I jumped in and sped away.  I was very spooked.  I would be willing to show an expert where I saw the prints.

In 1983 I lived in an old cabin off of Chicken Coop Road and Highway 1 near Sequim. The cabin was very remote and there was a 200 acre tract behind us that was second growth forest and very lush. I remember the 4 to 5' ferns and very large trees. The outhouse was about 100' from the house and across a stream. When I walked out the door I untied my Rottweiler/Doberman mix so she could walk with me. She was a very protective dog and I always felt safe with her around. Well she immediately ran under the cabin and refused to come out. Then I heard the crashing through the small alders on my left and it sounded BIG. I immediately ran back into the cabin and got my husband. He ran out the front door and heard the crashing through the trees. Needless to say, I slept with a wooden baseball bat and my husband slept with a machete since we didn't have anything else. That next morning we investigated the area we heard the sounds from. The grove of small 4"" alders that grew in that draw were broken off about 4' up from the bases of the trees. We found no tracks but there was a clear trail through that stand of trees. I don't what it was but I've been in the mountains most of my life and I'm familiar with most of the woodland creatures. I've never been so scared in my life and after 25 years and I remember very clearly as if it was yesterday.

53045,3056,23160,2007,Fall,November,WA,Mason County,A logging road in Mason county.,[Editor note: East side of the Olympic Mts. on private land south of Union],Highway 101,"This incident was originally reported to the BFRO by phone. The witness described a daylight encounter with his son while spotting for deer on private land near the Olympic Mountains. He said he and his son took some photos of the approaching figure with a cellphone. Five BFRO Investigators went to the witness's home to interview him and see the photos.  We spoke with the witness for over an hour, then recorded his full account.  Here is the transcript of the interview. The blurry cellphone photos are shown below the interview, in the Investigator Comments section. These images do not have enough clarity to show details of the figure, but they do show its approximate size, girth, posture and color.   ---------------------------------  BFRO Investigator: What were the events that led up to this incident?   Witness: We came down the road and turned around like usual and we go very slow down the end of the road. As we come down this road, probably at about 150 yards, maybe a little more out in the woods I could see something moving. I didn't know what it was and we went past a few trees and I ask the boy WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT? He couldn't see it, and I drove ahead about another five feet. Stopped the truck and you could see a form coming. I call it a sasquatch. It kept coming. I said Look at that! He said What is that?? Well I don't know what the hell it is and I don't even have my camera. Then he said You do too have a camera  youve got your cellphone. So I took the phone out and handed it to him. By the time he got the phone working that was when picture 1 was taken. It was about that time that it was fifty yards from us.  Then the next picture it was probably thirty yards, for picture 2, and then it turned to its left.   BFRO Investigator: Was it aware of you at that point?   Witness: It didn't act like it cared if we were there or not, other than it did turn. It was getting brushier between us and it and it turned, then went into an opening.  It came into the opening and then at one point it stopped and turned its head, looking right at us.   Investigator: Did it turn its head or whole body?   Witness: Well, the whole shoulder part - the front portion. It lifted its left shoulder back and twisted and looked at us. Then it just went right back into the angle it was.   Investigator: When it looked at you, what was the expression on its face? Could you see any of that?   Witness: I don't know.  It just looked at us. You know  deer-in-the-headlights type of look.  Investigator: Did it look surprised?   Witness: It looked more like the same as we were, What are you?  What the heck are you doing here?   I was just looking at the size of it cause it was ... IT WAS HUGE. I kept asking him, DID YOU GET A PICTURE??? You know, Did you get a picture??? (Witness's son).. I GOT A PICTURE THERE! Then it just turned back and to the angle it was originally going. Then it picked up its stride. It moved a little faster probably half again as fast as it was going. Then he (the witnesss son) got out of the truck, the boy did. Then it paused, like it was going to turn again and look at us but it didn't. It just turned, I don't know if it went around something or what and he got one more picture. Then it came on the road and he couldn't get one more picture before he left. I don't know how long all that took.   Investigator: So it cut across a logging road?  Witness: The road runs through there.  Investigator: And you lost it once it went across?   Witness: It stepped right on the road and I don't think it made two steps.  The first step and then it was standing, stopped right there and it looked right at us. It was standing more upright. The next step it went into heavy brush - just a deer trail or a little path. The brush just closed in around it. I pulled forward and there is another little road that goes down along the way it went and we never did see it again.   Investigator: You said it crossed the road, how many steps did it take to cross the road?   Witness: One, two it was across because it just stepped in the road and stepped off it. It's a narrow road. It's just a regular Ford pickup so it's the width of the pickup, brush rubs both sides of the truck so eight or nine feet. Like when deer will jump, hit the road once when they are running. It had the same stride as a deer would running - you know jumping through the woods.   Investigator: Was there a trail on either side of the road?   Witness: I didn't notice a trail where it came from as much as I noticed a trail from where it went. You know where it came from was bracken fern and salal brush. It's up there above my waist. Back here where it came, turned originally in the opening - there was water even then, probably it's a low spot kinda where it came through probably a foot deep or two feet deep from the rains.   Investigator: So would you estimate about 48 inches tall for the fern and the salal?   Witness: About that tall.  Then it goes in stages but your base layer is at least that high.   Investigator: So what we are seeing in these pictures is... ?  Witness: Oh his butt was above the brush, it's chest height on me.   [the witness is 6 feet tall]  Investigator: From that picture it appears the figure is down on all fours.   Witness: Don't think so, I don't think the hands were on the ground.   Investigator: You dont think its walking with its knuckles?  Witness: Everything else moved but the arms didn't.   They were just kind of there.  Investigator: So you didn't see any big arm movement, like when a gorilla walks quadrupedally?   Witness: I didn't see the arms moving at all.  Investigator: So it is walking hunched over but not down on all fours?   Witness: I didn't notice it being down on all fours.  Investigator: Just looking at the angle the torso is in, leaning quite far forward - it would be very difficult to walk in that manner without falling over.  Witness: Well I couldnt do it.. Laugh..   Investigator: Yeah, that is interesting.  Witness: I said it's not like he's crawling over logs or windfalls or anything either. He appears to be more hunched over in certain pictures than when he was walking towards us, but he was still hunched over coming towards us. I noticed as he was coming towards us that he walked from side to side.  Investigator: He waddled?  Witness: Yeah he swayed or something, like every step he would really make a big step,...you know like a little kid being proud or something... but I know, well you just need better pictures, you need to be there..  Investigator: You needed your video camera.  Witness: [Laughing] Yeah - I wouldn't have had these if the kid hadn't remembered the camera on the phone.  Investigator: So did you try to look for any impressions or footprints?   Witness: No actually, I can say no, I didn't.  The road is pretty hard.   It's all black crushed rock and that's hard as rock. There is nothing there where he came out of.  He didnt leave as much of a trail as I thought he would coming through the bracken ferns and stuff. That's what I thought. It surprised me, because after he came through there I figured you'd see a trail, as even brush pickers and mushroom pickers coming through you can see they're leaving trails. You know breaking them away, and there wasn't one. It was hard to see where he came out on to the road vs where he went in. He went in on a regular old deer trail & where he came out, it was almost undisturbed. That surprised me as a matter of fact. Places I went in there I left more of a trail in the bracken ferns than he did.  Investigator: What time of day was this?   Witness: It had to be around 10:00, 10:30.  Investigator: In the morning?   Witness: Yeah   Investigator: And it's on the 16th of November (2007).  Witness: Yeah a week ago Friday    Investigator: There weren't any other cars around?   Witness: No, there was nobody else there. Not where we were at.  Matter of fact, I didn't see anybody out there.    ","Two weeks later, the witness and a friend who works for the forest service, returned to the sighting area with a 10 foot long pole marked off in 1 foot segments.  They took pictures of the area and found the path the creature used.  The witness initially thought the animal was 8 ft tall, but upon re-examing the pictures with the 10 foot marker, he believes the creature would be between 9 and 10 feet tall, if standing fully erect.  The two men also found 19.5 inch impressions in the mossy areas the animal walked on. ",The witness and his son.  Spotting for deer.,"The witness's other two sons and a couple of friends were chased out of a creek drainage by something that was crashing through the brush, running in the creek, throwing things into the creek and growling and ""hollering.""

The weather was a misty / drizzly morning.,"At the time the pictures were taken, the bracken fern was still standing erect, but was brown/orange in color.  The salal was 3 to 5 ft tall.

We were in between Trout Lake and Glenwood.,Trout Lake and Glenwood,Sunnyside Rd.,"I took my friend out turkey hunting near Mt Adams. We went out the evening on the 15th to camp overnight before opening day. We arrived at our camp and got settled in. I got out my crow call and made a call, I had heard a turkey reply so I felt we had a good chance. We woke up about a half hour before sunrise and headed out. As we were walking to our hunting location we heard a tree limb snap and looked to our left, we observed a large dark in color animal walking away from us. I use the term walking because it did not sound like a deer or elk running from us. We wondered what it was and decided to continue on. We got to our area about thirty minutes later and set up our decoys and got in our ground blind. I started to make turkey calls and had heard a few reply. We sat there still calling when we heard this scream. It sounded like a police siren but only the first note. It lasted for maybe a second and sounded like it came from right behind us. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and looked to my right to notice a dark in color large animal moving away from us in a rather fast pace. It was big enough to move the small trees that were in its way. We immediately packed up our decoys and left the area. I was very confused by what had just happened and did not want to tell people about it. I felt that I would just get made fun of about it. About four months after it happened I talked to the Washington State fish and game about it and they told me that it was a cougar. I have hunted since i was in high school and am now 33. I have seen and heard plenty of animals that live in this state. I am 100 percent convinced that whatever made that sound and was observed by me and my hunting partner was not an elk, deer or bear and was to large to be a cougar.

We did not feel threatened or scared at the time. The sounds were deep. Something between a roar and screem. They had a very deep growly under tone. In between sounds my husband was disagreeing with me. He suggested it was an elk or coyote. Our dogs both became clingy and started whining, so I had to bring them inside so we could hear. When I came out I started counting how long the sounds were. I counted 5 seconds. My husband said that while I was in the house there was one about 3 seconds longer or about 8 seconds. The sounds were deep but some of them changed pitch going even lower midway through. What ever was making the sounds had much larger lung capacity that even a big man. That is what finally convinced my husband it had to be a big foot. All other animal calls we have heard go higher rather than lower. The sounds contined for about 5 minutes.

I rationalised it in my mind as a deer jumping through the woods quickly. But when I saw the outline of the deer I knew immediately what it was. Granted it was dark, but with the moon out and lack of cloud cover I could make out a black shape 7' or 8' tall striding through the underbrush.

I had stopped and set up camp at a lake and on the first day every thing was normal .I had the lake all to myself as to be expected because of lakes remoteness and hard climb .Lake is situated in a box canyon with great acoustics and I was banging away on my guitar and singing loudly bouncing my sounds off the walls and echoing out a large area,I was also hooting and making strange calls as too attract or scare any game and or let someone know I was there. Second day I set out for day hike and exploration and things got weird.I head over to other side of the lake along a sheer wall that rises about 1000 feet up to summit straight up almost jumping large rock screes and swinging with the aid of blueberry bushes 40 feet above lake i reach the other side  to a level area and begin planned day hike . Upon returning to level area I glanced up to the ridge above and instantly draw onto the hi-gloss sheen of something  against the flat color of fauna and rock wich I percieve to be game.  I then try too rouse it withh verbal calls and arm wavings but nothing happens and after several minutes I give up and swing back the half mile to camp. It is now about 4 o'clock and I'm cooking dinner and I hear a screech  coming from where I just came from , nothing to out of the ordinary , could of been a cat or a screech owl but it  makes me uncomfortable I decide to gather lots of wood for a good firen . night falls and I continue  to play my guitar and make lots of noise because I have this uneasy feeling, kinda of an I'm big and bad here attitude I build the fire big and retreat to my tent and fall asleep. At around 11 o'clock I'm guessing I am awaken to this incredibly loud  crack somewhat like a high velocity rifle but louder like close lightning and then the sound of large rocks falling. This startles the crap out of me and  I un-zip  my tent and start shouting obscenities and  try to make myself big and scary, even to the point of barking like a dog. My earlier paranoia has gotten to me and I become un-nerved and frightened.I quickly  re-build the fire and am all ears and eyes except that theres nothing too see because of the pitch blackness. About 40 minutes later it happens again but closer to me this time and I kinda loose it again and start screaming and barking all over again.I stay awake frightened untill first light and not hearing another sound I quickly load up my gear and get the heck out. Upon returning I feel foolish for getting un-nerved and sort the situation up to my own paranoia and a natural occurance of possibly trees snaping off the ledge and or rocks breaking off and doing the same. I  am interested in returning back immediatly , but not alone .

I lived on a piece of property that had 4 houses on about 20 acres. I was 9 at the time and so was my friend.  There were 8 to 9 ponds with a creek connecting them.  They were small ponds average size probably 20 by 30 feet.  There was a field on one side of the upper ponds and a hillside on the other with dense fir trees of various size. It was a fall day probably October and around 4pm and it was kind of dark and cloudy with a medium rain fall.  From the start of one pond to the end of the last pond it was probably 150 to 200 yards. My house was about 100 to 150 yards from the sighting.  My friend and I were catching crawdads in the ponds. We had probably been out there for a couple of hours when it happened. I was close to the ponds on the field side and my friend was behind me about 10 or 15 feet on the field side.  I looked up the hillside 20 feet up and 40 to 50 yards away where I saw a creature 8 feet tall walking upright at a angle going up the hillside.  The hillside was about 125 feet tall. It was big I yelled at my friend, it turned and looked at us.  My friend did not know what I was yelling about.  I started to run towards my house.  I ran right by my friend yelling.  He then saw it and started running behind me. I was terribly scared as was my friend. I only saw it for about 5 or 10 seconds but I know what I saw.  It was big and walking upright.  It looked like the bigfoot from the patterson-gimlin film honestly.  I recall it being black or dark brown with short to medium hair.  I talked to my friend a couple of years ago and we talked about the incident and he agreed with me about what happened.  I had not talked to him for 20 years plus about it. We live in different places now and alot has changed but we know what we both saw and with out a doubt it was a bigfoot.

It was a clear night, full moon which makes for a breath taking view of Rattlesnake Ridge.  This was before all the development was done so we pulled his truck into a clearing (to the left of the main road as you come up on the lake.) We parked and climbed in the bed of the truck.  I would say 15 mins later we heard a rustle in the bushes.  When we turned to look there was a very large animal of some sort.  It was taller then the average black bear and stood like a man.  We litterly sat there froze for a good 2 minutes.  It would turn to the left and walk 3-4 large steps, stop and face our direction.  A few seconds later it would do the same to the right.    I would say it was a good 40 yards from us and a good 15 yards from the tree line. It stood 7+ feet tall, long arms, covered in what seemed to be dark hair and walked like a human as it paced.  It was dark and too far away to see its face. Finally my friend slowly grabed my arm and asked me what the hell that was?!  I replied that i had no idea, but it is freaking HUGE!  We both jumped out of the bed of the truck throwing his spare tire on top of our blankets and made a mad dash for the cab.    As he drove away I watched out the back window and it just stood there.  To this day i wish he has turned a full circle and shined his lights at it so we could have gotten a better look.  I grew up in the Snoqualmie/North Bend area and spent many summer nights a days at that lake and in the woods. My friend was a hunter and in the military. There was no way it was an animal from this area...   I didn't tell anyone about this for years and when i finally did they all laughed at me like I was a nut case.

I read a report that I thought lead me to the area but Im having trouble finding it. My girlfriend and I decided on the spur of the moment to go check it out.

We werent sleeping very soundly we were both waking throughout the night.  At about 3am I woke up and noticed the fire was about to go out, I hoped out of the truck turned some logs on the fire, took a leak and crawled back in bed.

Within 30 seconds another one answered back from what I would guess to be a mile away atleast.  I grabed the flashlight and the rifle(just in case)I shined the light in the tree line.

A couple years back we had found a closed road that lead up to an enchanting pocket of old growth forest which allowed for decent visibility yet had vegetation that would seem to be sufficient to hide and feed wildlife.  I find old growth forests magical, but my brother found this spot somewhat spooky, due to its isolation and dead still quiet.  Nonetheless, we walked the 1.5 miles up the road into this forest, where the road terminates in a small ridge and a pocket of thick, second growth fir beyond that.  We seperated about 75 yards and sat for about a half hour just watching and listening.  That's when we heard some unusual sounds.  To my mind, they were kind of like a bird hoot or something, but the sounds were loud and nothing I'd ever heard before (not an owl).  These sounds occurred two or three times.  When my brother and I reunited, we both mentioned these sounds to each other and were confused because they were unusual to us both.  He did not think they sounded at all like a bird.  Since we had been out all day, we then decided to retire and head back down the trail.  About 6 months later we came upon the ""Whoop Howl"" sounds on the BFRO site and were both astounded to find that these were very similar to the sounds that we had heard during our hunting trip.","On a hunting trip a couple of years prior to this encounter, my friend and I had found an elk carcass decomposing very close to the area where we heard the unusual sounds.

The logging road where the sighting took place, was off the NFD 5060 Road.","North Bend, Washington",SE Middle Fork Road / NFD 5060 Road,"I was driving a truck while hauling a dozer on a trailer.  My task was to deliver the dozer to a logging site.  It was early morning and I'd driven east out of North Bend, WA along the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River on SE Middle Fork Road which turns into NFD 5060 Road east of Mt. Si.  I then took a logging road on my way to the drop off site.    As I drove down the logging road, up ahead along the side of the road I saw two tall people walking in the direction I was heading.  My first reaction was that they were really tall and must be basketball players.  As I got closer, it looked like they were wearing dark colored full body wetsuits with hoods.  I tried to make sense of what I was seeing and thought maybe they were bow hunters wearing a special suit.  As I drove closer I could see that they both had unusually long arms and that one had a more female shape and stood about 7 feet tall compared to the other which had a male shape and stood about 8 feet tall.    The subjects then reacted to my approach by stopping and turning around toward me and stood in the middle of the road in a slightly crouched position.  They seemed agitated and with their feet stationary they turned and looked at both sides of the road by rotated their upper bodies at the waste back and forth, back and forth while swinging their arms at their sides.  When they did this, they looked very ape like.    As I closed to about 35-40 yards away, the female jumped and ran off the left side of the road toward the river and disappeared into the brush.  The male stayed in the road a little longer shuffling to the left side of the road.  Finally, as I got even closer, in one step from the edge of the road he jumped a distance of around 20 feet and easily cleared what I now could see was a thicket of thorny blackberry vines at least 8 feet tall, and he was gone.      They were both dark brown in color from head to toe.  Their faces were dark brown also.  I didn't really notice if they had fur or hair.  Perhaps the fur or hair was wet and matted down from the rain.  I didn't notice any odor or sounds.   I continued to the drop off site 1-2 miles further down the road and began to unload the dozer.  Another driver who was less than a minute or so behind me on the same road arrived.  After unloading and somewhat composing myself, I asked the other driver if he'd seen anything strange along the logging road on his way in.  He said he had not.  I then left the drop off site and stopped at the encounter location.  I looked around but did not find any large tracks in the thin layer of snow along the side of the road.  There was no snow on the dirt/gravel logging road itself.  I didn't want to battle the blackberry vines to follow the creatures' escape route into the forest, so I took off.  The only explanation I have for what I saw is that the creatures must have been sasquatches.  Because no human could be that big and jump like that and I know they weren't bears.

I stopped the car, and was looking forward, with my high beams on. As I watched a grey/brown very non descript patch to the right of the road in front of me seemed to move. I was concentrating to try to see what it was when it walked out into the road, and in 2 steps was gone on the other side into the brushy timber.

The animal was bipedal, stood upright, was apx. 6-7 feet tall, covered in long matted looking greyish/brown hair.

It came from a height, and my first thought was an owl in large tree about 25 yards away, but it didn't sound avian at all.  It sounded strangely feminine for some reason.  Reading the BFRO forum I saw owls, cougars, and foxes can emit calls that may be sasquatch-ish, but listening to audio clips of these critters I've found on the internet won't allow me to categorize the sound as any of these known species.  Came out to the general area the following week and camped near Lost Lake, about 1.5 miles to the west.

53059,3303,25194,2008,Fall,November,WA,Skamania County,Fire road 66 in the south prairie  ,between carson and guller wa,fire road 66,"Well, I must admit to being rather surprised to ever find myself to be putting together a ""report"" of big foot activity.   With that said, I would like to share with you folks my experience this fall during the 2008 late muzzle loading hunt in Washington state. I saw two different set tracks On two separate days, in different areas of the wind river hunting unit.   The below single track was well defined and very recent, as the grass was still coming out of the print whilst I observed it. If I had to guess the print was about 13 to 14 inches long with no instep, five toes and I marveled at how big the big toe was. Anatomically correct in relation to the other toes. Depth was about 3/4 of an inch into the ground.   I was well away from the fire roads and still hunting in loops to keep the wind in our favor and to do a complete stalk of the habitat. As I still hunt at a glacial pace I see a lot of game and don't hardly ever disturb the wild life I'm hunting through. I wear dark wool clothes and use the primitive equipment of the fur trade era.    My son and I both closely studied the print. I could see less defined impressions leading away by laying on the ground sighting in the direction of travel. As the ground was in a semi frozen state that was softening up after an previous evening of light rain. This was a single print in a remote area well away from the fire roads.   The above single track was well defined and very recent, as the grass was still coming out of the print whilst I observed it. If I had to guess the print was about 13 to 14 inches long with no instep, five toes and I marveled at how big the big toe was. Anatomically correct in relation to the other toes.

As I still hunt at a glacial pace I see a lot of game and don't hardly ever disturb the wild life I'm hunting through. I wear dark wool clothes and use the primitive equipment of the fur trade era.   I was in the south prairie area on the north end of the lava flow. As I had seen a cow and a calf tracks in a area south and east of the area we were in, we planned to return to a  different spot via a circuitous route using the available cover and watch a park like area that isn't easily viewed for the evening hunt. This overlooked a sandy area that was the result of flooding outflow. Laying down a volcanic pumice like sand. I was keeping track of the tracks that went up and down the temporary water bed as it effectively cut the prairie in half making it convenient to get a ""snapshot"" of the previous evenings events. These were all marked and noted each morning when in the area. I was narrowing my hunt down to these two animals.  That evening, while looking over the prairie and glassing the adjacent treeline from the cover of a large tree, I heard a knock or thwack about 150 yards out (Since I was elk hunting I thought it was an antler strike). This was about 10 minutes before the end of legal shooting light as I keep close track of my time when finishing out the day's hunt. Optimistic about the next day's scenario already, we headed for the truck assisted with flashlights. Which we did not turn on until we were well away from this spot as we intended to be back in the morning before day break. We also used the available trees and cover to mask our departure as well.  Next morning, we returned and set up on the previous evenings spot. After the sun was well up I and my son went out on to the prairie to check the sandy wash for sign. This is where we saw three distinct tracks, one in the sand then two deeper ones about 80 inches apart with the last easily defined print on the other side of an log that I could tell, didn't even break it's stride for. These were identical to yesterdays tracks, size, depth shape etc. I feel that it was the same animal.  There are numerous other details, conjecture etc, that I would be happy to discuss now that I am no longer in denial! I am hopeful that this information is of some small help.

53007,3316,25280,2008,Summer,August,WA,Chelan County,Specific directions omitted,Chelan,,"While on a mountain-bike ride down ********* trail, located approx 17 miles northwest of Chelan Washington.  I came around a left-hand bend in the trail, which was proceeding up a ridgeline slope of moderate grade.  The trail was well packed and damp, as a rainstorm had preceded my biking trip by two days. This weather pattern was unusual for Central Washington in the late summer month of August.  I was biking alone, and the section of trail preceding my unidentified animal sighting was downhill and allowed me to ride quickly, making little noise.  As I proceeded around the left hand bend in the trail, my vision was drawn to a motion on the ridgeline that continued to my upward left.  What I saw was a tall (approx 8 ft), Dark brown, longhaired animal running rapidly in a bi-pedal manner from the exposed ridgeline in a northwesterly direction.  He remained in my line of vision as he ran through a moderately dense high alpine forest. It was astounding to me how quickly and quietly the animal was able to move for his sheer body size.  I immediately stopped my bike with the initial sight of this animal.  After stopping my bike, the animal remained within my sight for approx 10-15 seconds as he was running rapidly away from my intrusion.  There was no mistaking this animal's height as I am 6' 4"", and my estimate of 8 ft. may be a moderate estimate of actual height.  There also was no mistaking the bi-pedal pattern of running exhibitited by this unknown animal.  After seeing the animal run through the forest, I dropped my bike where I stood, and walked quietly down to the point where I saw him cross the trail.  The tracks of this animal showed poorly as the ground on either side of the trail was densely vegetated with low-lying grasses and shrubs. It was remarkable to see such a large animal move so quickly and efficiently through the density of the forest.  I looked for broken twigs, branches, or hair and found none. I failed to find tracks within the trail.","On Aug. 28th, the day after my ride down ******* ******* {trail name}, I went on a second ride to Myrtle Lake (F.S. trail 1400) up the Entiat River. On this ride I came across a black bear that was easily identified, and helped clarify in my own mind that what I saw most definitely was not a bear.",No other witnesses,"I had heard of no other incidents or sightings.  After talking with my cousin about the unknown animal sighting, he did some Internet research and told me about the Brent McCay (report # 21189) sighting further north on Lake Chelan from the ferry-service boat Lady of the Lake.","Time: approx 9:00 am Lighting:  Full morning sun-light, no fog, smoke, or haze.","The trail at that point was proceeding up a semi-exposed rocky ridgeline, with high alpine conifers (elev. approx 5800 ft) growing only on the western facing slopes.  The trees were approx 20-30 ft in height, and semi-densly spaced with moderate underlying forest floor foliage.  It was at this point that I saw the unknown bi-pedal animal.",27
53031,3337,25462,1980,Summer,August,WA,Jefferson County,As described above.  Mount Jupiter.  Mount Jupiter Lake #2,Brinnon,Hwy 101 or Dosewallips River Rd.,"It was the summer of 1979 or maybe 1980.  My friend and I hiked up the Mt. Jupiter trail to go fly fishing at one of the Jupiter Lakes, which I think might be referred to as #2.  You drop down over the ridge to the north before getting to the summit of Mt. Jupiter to reach the first 3 of 5 lakes I believe.  There is no trail to the lakes, so you must drop over the ridge to get down to the first lake, sometimes hanging on to a bit of brush.  There are 3 lakes on this side.  We got to the first, followed the outlet and went and camped at the 2nd lake down.  I think we stayed two nights.  It was probably the 2nd day when this incident happened.  There were some other guys that had camped on the other side of the lake and had left about 2-3 PM I recall.  My time frames are not exactly clear anymore.  Nonetheless, the guys that had been camping on the opposite side of the lake had left about 3 hours previous to what I call a didnt pay enough attention encounter.  I was fly fishing the shoreline sort of off to the side on the opposite end of the lake.  Being an intense fly fisherman concentrating on my fishing, I saw what was, I thought at first, a person had returned to the camp to get something they might had forgotten.  I didnt pay any attention because I had remembered there were people that had camped there.   At the moment, while concentrating fishing, I didnt look directly at the camp, but saw a figure out of the corner of my eye.  It was probably their for a minute or maybe less.  Out of the corner of my eye, this figure, walked back and forth maybe a couple of times in the area and finally walked with a large stride, across the campsite and disappeared into the woods.  After it had disappeared, the thought of the stride struck me as odd.  It was a big stride, arms swinging, just as the video of the sasquatch that was spotted in the late 60s down in Eureka, California.  After it had disappeared, the oddness of the stride made me look over at the campsite.  Then it hit me how very odd it seemed because of the movement and stride of the figure out of the corner of my eye.  I was actually upset for not taking a better look, and further upset because I had my camera quite handy at the time.  I carry it to take pictures of trout I catch.  I dont remember where my friend was at the time since it was a long time ago, but anyway, I told him about it.  I said lets go over there and see if we can find some tracks, so we did.  When we got there we discovered the campsite area was a huge rock mass with moss growing on it.  We found no tracks, but we didnt look that hard either.  I must say, that we could hardly sleep that night.  Nothing more unusual happened that I can recall.  I had seen the film of the sasquatch spotting down in Eureka by the Patterson guy, long before this hiking/fishing trip, so the swinging of the arms and stride had sort of stuck in my mind and this thing, whatever it was, had that same movement.  Too bad I didnt look straight at ittoo bad I didnt snap a photo.  I regret it to this day.  I can say that the creature coloring was a brownish reddish color.  It didnt dawn on me until after this thing disappeared, that I didnt see any clothing from the corner of the eye observation encounter  I just thought I should report this after all these years.  I never have.  I can say that the area is very rugged country and is not easy to get to.  The campers on the north side of the lake had come somewhere up from the Dosewallips River where I dont know of any trail access, so they must have bushwacked to get to the lakes from that side.",,Just myself.

We had gotten out of the truck originally because we had seen two does on the right side of the vehicle in a empty pond. On the our left side we were hearing branches break and bushes move, hoping it was a big buck. After waiting 20 minutes or so, we changed our position to in order to hopefully get a better angle as to what was making noise in the brush, when doing so the two does went north of our position trotting away, less than 15 seconds after that we both heard a sound like a deep roar tailing off to a squealing sound at the same time, an undescribable sound, not a bear, wolf, coyote or cat. Literally seconds after that the same two deer sprinted past us within just 5 to 7 feet as if we werent there and the least of the their concern. After they ran a few seconds after that we heard heavy footed running along the ridgeline above the empty pond, and at this point we ran in the vehicle and took off. The running on the ridgline was not a trot, or four legged run, these were distinctly two legs running weighing alot because we could hear the ground smashing.","Well not too far from out first area where me and my cousin have experienced our first ordeal, we were up in republic up in the hills hunting by some very old mines and we were walking the trail and we were hearing clicking noises, like wood against wood, in durations of two with about 15 second pauses in between, going from left to right to behind us, which we thought absolutely nothing of it but from just critters making noise, but the odd thing was it followed us with those clicking noises for about 2 miles until we got out of the trail then it stopped. every year we are up there we experience something along these lines and think nothing of it, but it is in the same hunting spot every year where this occurs.","Two, we were hunting for buck deer, and as being close to deers being in rut we were hoping to see a buck around these two does",,5 p.m. still daylight getting ready to approach dusk,"pine forsest, near empty pond, similiar to swamp, not too far from some mountians and farm land.",14

The first I have already reported. It happened back in march of '05. It was about 1 or 1:30 in the morning and it was pretty warm in my room, so I got up to open the window. As I was standing there let the cool air hit my face I heard a cry that was kind of what I would have to say a moan/growl. It was coming from the hill that is in front of the house I live at. I have lived up here since '96 so I get to hear the sounds of nature and I can say for sure this wasn't anything I've ever heard before. I didn't even think it could be a bigfoot until the next week when I told my dad. He told me son I think you heard a bigfoot. I wasen't ready for that, then he tried to tell me what it would sound like from what other people reported and that was what I heard that night. The second is like the first close to where I heard the first. I was on a back road between my house and the next road over. It was dusk out and I was coming to an intersection just before I got to a cattleguard when I heard something. I stopped and turned off my truck to listen better. I stuck my head out the window when I heard the some type of moan/growl as in first. This time I got pretty excited. It was coming from behind and on a high bald hill to the east of where I was. This incident happened in august of '08.   Now for number three. This happened back in '08 but in Febuary when there was snow on the ground which dosen't make walking very easy. Well I went to this hill over looking the area I live which is above my friends place. I have walked this same area for awhile and this is this first time I ever found a foot print. As I was starting to climb out of a dip in the hill there it was. I thought it was weird for someone to be out in the snow in their bare feet. As I stood there looking at the print I remember what I read in some reports find something to compare the size to. Two problems one I didn't get my digital camera until may and all I had to compare the size to was my size 13 foot. The size of that print out did me by three sizes.

53077,3402,26065,2007,Summer,August,WA,Yakima County,Withheld,"Naches, WA",Hwy 410,"It happened close to midnight on August 18, 2007, on the last official night of a private expedition, east of Mt. Rainier in the Wenatchee National Forest, of Washington State. Out of respect for our WA-BFRO crew's primary Central Washington State research area, I've purposely withheld the exact location and am using ""Chinook Pass,"" which covers a broad general area.  The event was both a weekend social gathering as well as a field expedition with one main base camp and several satellite camps over a 10-mile area. The area (which I initially felt was very dry aside from several marshy areas nearby, contained a tremendous amount of elk sign) has been used for a previous BFRO expedition as well as other private outings. It's been a consistent hot zone for our WA crew, who, lacking sophisticated heat-sensing equipment, have experienced a lot of curious activity over the years including purported vocalizations, wood-knocking, powerful footfalls, branch breaking, persons being paralleled, etc. and several documented sightings nearby within the BFRO database.   In attendance were various members of both WABFR (Washington Bigfoot Field Research Group) & a majority of WA-BFRO researchers. A few of us CA-BFRO members were invited and held the furthest base camp from the main camp & shared that particular site with various WA bigfooters. A matter of fact, on any given night our camp held about 14-15 people with many walking back and forth only on the primary dirt road to the closest adjacent camp about one mile away. During the first two nights, there was no activity to report from my perspective other then some of the best barred owl vocalizations I've ever heard in my years in the field.   For most of that Saturday, August 18th, I spent the day in Seattle with my friend Jamie J, picking up his son and we returned to the camp location around 5:30 PM. At around 11:00 PM our site held about 13-14 people (most of them researchers) who were consolidated in one small area. Everyone was congregated into this section of the camp that was bordered by vegetation on the backside in which there was a berm and trail running parallel right behind that vegetative border. Being a little antsy and not much in a socializing mood, I took a walk down that back pathway about 100 yds, (which was pitch black on a dark night with plenty of tree cover) to relieve myself. 30-40 yards further down that pathway the trail led to a swampy marsh & was broken up by denser vegetation & ponderosa pine (see map picture for camp layout).    In the middle of urinating I was facing towards camp and heard a very close step-branch break at my eight-a-clock, 6-7 yds from me that did not give me the immediate impression a large subject was responsible. Casually walking back to camp and not hearing anything further, I asked one of my best friends & research partner, former BFRO researcher Cliff B., if I could borrow his X200xp handheld thermal imaging unit to scout around camp & see if I could see the subject responsible for the branch break on the pathway I'd just returned from. He immediately obliged and we walked to his truck, which was located about 30 yds behind the current congregated area in the opposite direction of that same pathway. When I received it, I immediately walked to the front of that pathway near where our tent was placed perpendicular to the trail and my companions congregation area was to my left about 20 yds in front of me down a small berm.   As I could hear Cliff reshuffling equipment around the back of his truck, I put the imager to my eye to tune it and while doing so caught a glimpse of a small wood rat running 10 yds in front of me to the right. Straight ahead, I caught the heat signature of what I initially thought was a person standing behind a tree, beyond my party where it was pitch black. My initial impression did not change for about 20 seconds with the combination of only seeing about 10-15% of the subject. (partial legs, arms, knee & head were contrasted behind that biggest tree in view: see re-creation pic # 2) The subject then began to move its head right to left behind the tree repeatedly as if to possibly discern me or my presence more clearly. It then stepped out in plain view and dropped to ""all fours"" positioning, (see re-creation pic #3) looking over its left shoulder rotating its head in my direction as if to ""lock-in"" with arms fully extended and knees down. The second when it stepped out before dropping, the realization of what the subject was hit me and my reaction was a ""surreal"" shock considering the unexpected circumstances.  When on the ground, the subject transitioned very rapidly to where it appeared it was now full body down favoring its right shoulder, rapidly moving and appeared to actually be inching up away from the tree it was initially behind & into a bit of a clearing from my perspective view. Knowing that the thermal unit I had was not self-recordable like a camcorder (at that time, to record video, our set-up was a back-pack attached to your front side containing a mini-DVR, connecting battery with plug-ins and helmet mount for the imager) I began snapping my fingers whispering loud ""Cliff,"" ""Cliff"" as I could hear Cliff repacking his truck about 30-35 yards behind me at a seven-a-clock position- back left. As I did that, the subject, who was grounded, still leaning off the right shoulder, began an almost unnerved & panicked, full-body convulsive movement obviously reactionary to the sound of my snapping fingers and voice (see re-creation pic #5). Oddly enough, it would pause-freeze in between those intervals and I was blown away that it appeared to react to my minimal sound, while my party (almost halfway between our line of site) was making a considerable amount of noise with conversing & acoustic guitar-playing.   Cliff never responded in my cautious 5-6 attempts to get his attention and the subject further transitioned on the ground into what appeared to be a ""breaststroke"" uniformed-like motion (see re-creation pics #6 & #7). ""It"" was on its knees, head straight, facing toward a nine-o-clock position from my point of view, slightly down, back straight with clear space in between front torso and ground and violently swinging back what appeared to be both arms in a stroke-like motion. The hand positioning from my view (looking at the left arm) appeared to be positioned as if having four fingers held tight together and a thumb spaced away or extended, but I'm not absolutely certain. I could clearly see the subject repeat this movement 3-4 times and it appeared as if the large upper-body was being held up by the subject's abdominal muscles by the positioning and vertical space between the upper torso and ground.   From this position, the subject got back down completely on the ground on its right shoulder and held an open hand above its face (facing me) as if ""blocking the sun from its eyes."" (see re-creation pics #8 & #9) I could even make out pretty clearly, five spread digits on the left hand up by its face.  From this positioning the very agile subject appeared to ""pop-up"" from the ground clearly using no arms and quickly backed behind the initial tree I first witnessed it from. Again it looked at me right to left with its alternating head on both sides of the tree before dropping right back to the ground behind that same tree. It immediately came back up with what appeared to be the benefit of one arm which I believe was its right (am not certain because of how quickly it got up). Within seconds, it had quickly moved a few feet further back in the clear with its back clearly to me and what looked like the left leg slightly forward (see re-creation pics #10 & #11) and remained completely motionless for the next 40-45 seconds or so. Now I could clearly see the full profile of the subject (estimate about 90%) from about just below the calves up. Remarkably, I do not recall actually seeing its feet from my vantage point during the entire encounter. I can remember just repeating to myself under my breath, over and over, ""Oh my god, oh my god, I can't believe it's really happening, right now.""  Its appearance (even with a white thermal profile) was absolutely remarkable & distinct with uneven weight distribution. The subject appeared to clearly possess about 2/3rds of its body weight in the upper extremities. It was obvious that the subject was predominantly bipedal by its build, though its movements on the ground just prior appeared agile, fluid and effortless. The subject's legs were fairly long but not particularly bulky in relationship to the massive torso above the waist as the bulk appeared from the waist up into just these massive shoulders & traps with no visible neck and what appeared to be from behind-- a smallish-rounder head (no discernable sagittal crest). The arm length was astonishing in that they looked ""exaggerated"" and appeared to hang as low as the subjects knees and possibly even further. A matter of fact, my guess would have its fingertips if completely extended (large hands seemed almost fisted) reach mid-to top calves. That impression was slightly thrown off a bit by the discovery the next day in daylight where it appeared the left foot had stepped over a small foot deep berm (while subject's back to me) just beyond the 10-15 yard window the subject stayed in during the whole encounter. The physical impression beyond that small berm, visually appeared to match the distance the subject was from me the night before and was also in wet thick pine-needle duff after raining all night.  After about 40-45 seconds of just staring at this basically, glowing live ""statue,"" I had an extremely difficult decision to make--either continue watching the subject until it departs or attempt to document it by taking the imager from my eye, run back and notify Cliff to set-up for recording capability while praying the subject wouldn't leave in the process. I chose the latter, and it was one of the most difficult but unregrettable things I've done in my life. The last image I have of this subject was seeing it in that ""departing"" position (never saw it leave or even move again, just stood there glowing through the imager).   I immediately ran towards Cliff, who was still at the back of his truck and was just screaming at him words I don't recall but must have been obvious as he moved very quickly in what I needed him to do. To my chagrin, looking back from where I came, the guitar playing had stopped and I could here a variety of scattering voices from my party and movement, including two people with headlamps on totally oblivious to what was happening, while walking up the small berm and into the line of sight between where I stood opposed to the subject during the encounter. In a panic, and without much of an explanation other then ""I just saw one, get back,"" I attempted to pull everybody back into the congregation area and continue with what they were doing minutes earlier. I had to physically pull some people back who began curiously looking down that pathway behind the congregation area. I knew Cliff was moving quickly and within minutes, saw him fully geared, running quickly back down the path towards where I last witnessed the subject standing. For the few minutes he was back there, my heart was racing from adrenalin & I was still cautiously optimistic Cliff would maybe catch the subject loitering or even departing. Unfortunately, after about 5 minutes he came back & looked at me shaking his head.  About an hour later, close to 1:00 AM, Paul G. (WA-BFRO), walked back to the spot so we could interpret actual distance of the subject from my positioning during the encounter. As I saw him walk back to the initial tree it was behind, I yelled, ""stop,"" and he estimated the distance using his own steps at about 150 ft (50 yds). (After returning to this exact area the weekend of September 17-20th 2009, through exact measurement we determined that I first witnessed the subject at around 50 yds with a slight right to left angle, but worked my way up to only 33 yds from the subject with a line of sight from right to left-opposite ends of pathway).  Seeing him stand there made my jaw drop as I know Paul is 6'3 & 170lbs, and it was a shock to see him ""fully clothed"" & realize the size discrepancy between both he and the subject. I'd estimate the subject at 4-7 inches taller, but even conservatively estimating its size in comparison, it was about 3 times the total body mass of Paul G. Even with the depth perception issue of this particular proprietary unit I was experienced with, I knew the subject was big once it was in the clear with its back to me, but was shocked how much thicker and oddly proportioned it was compared to Paul. I've always been great estimating people's height and poor estimating people's weight, but by comparing Paul within one hour after and the encounter so fresh in my mind, I'd estimate the subject I saw as being close to 7 ft (maybe 6'9 or 6'8) and between 475, to as much as 575 lbs.  As I said earlier, the next day in daylight, what looked like a foot impression dug into heavy, wet duff was first noticed by Jamie J. and looked to be about where the subject had its back to me and left leg slightly forward. Except for the placement, it was unimpressive. Although there was heavy overnight rain, Jamie also found where the ground had been disturbed in several places where the subject had been transitioning on the ground. All of this surface was non-conducive substrate for any kind of attempted casting however and made up of wet, rain-soaked, pine needles. (to see the type of ground cover & me reenacting the subject's movements see second to last picture)  It should also be mentioned that 10-15 minutes after the encounter, a female WA-BFRO member thought she was paralleled while walking away from our camp with her boyfriend on the primary vehicle road. Another CA member later heard heavy footfalls several hours later about 30 yds from where I witnessed the subject, and in the early morning hours of about 3:30-4 AM, in a heavy rain, two of us in separate tents heard large (powerful) bipedal footfalls outside our tents (confirmed next day) followed by what sounded like guttural ""doe-like"" grunts. Outside of my tent was a stationed 250D Raytheon thermal imager facing down the pathway of the encounter, but the subject never came close to breaching that pathway (was well behind opposite side of tent) & would've made little difference if it had as the battery life for that unit does not exceed 2 to 2 1/2 hours.    Six of us also stayed in the camp one more night (August 19, 2009) and the night was uneventful around camp. But undetermined vocalizations (possibly barred owl) came from the ridge behind us (several miles away) well into the  morning.   ""RE-CREATION"" picture links in sequence below:   (Note)--All ""Re-Creations"" were done taking a digital color picture of the immediate sighting location & the roughly 15-yard window the subject remained in the whole encounter, making it black & white to give a generic ""thermal effect."" The subject was colored in using whiteout and should not be gaged by recurring size in each individual re-creation as my artwork has limitations. The idea was to give the reader/viewer a general impressionist view focusing on the various subject positioning I recall & a general idea of how the subject visually appeared to me.  All re-creations were completed by me within two to three weeks after the encounter (late August to early September 2007)                                  Link to Canadian artist Brian Cundle's poster rendition of the sighting event:  http://northamericanbigfoot.blogspot.com/2010/09/brian-cundle.html      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More details, potential insight & subjective interpretations from my perspective regarding the subject during the encounter.  --At no time did I hear or see the subject vocalizing in any manner  ---From the time I first saw the subject behind the tree until I took that imager off my eye while it was in a ""frozen"" but ""departing"" position, the subject remained within about a 10-15-yard window during the whole estimated two-plus minutes of the encounter.  --Although it's probable based on time and location, I'm not 100% certain that the ""step, branch break,"" down the trail 5-10 minutes before the encounter can be attributed to the subject I actually witnessed.   --I'm certain that without using the thermal imager out of curiosity and boredom, myself nor anyone else in my party would've ever known one of these animals was there. Considering the circumference of the actual camp and where I witnessed the subject, it was strategically positioned far enough back to having no chance of being noticed on a quarter moon night under heavy tree cover. (see camp layout map)  --With the unnerved reaction by the subject to my loud whispers and finger-snapping with noisy companions between our line of sight, I believe I saw obvious visual evidence of acute & possibly directional hearing ability of the subject. Furthermore, I believe and it's just my opinion, that the subject never could clearly see me (by never seeming to lock-in visually) but knew my exact presence at all times, maybe either through sound or my likely subconscious, nervous footsteps trying to position myself for better views.  -- For as much as I could see, I'm certain I missed a lot when the subject was ""grounded."" Some of the transitioning was so rapid that it was indiscernible during brief intervals in the encounter & can't properly be described. Much of what couldn't be made out in the rapid transitional movements (like when the subject appeared unnerved) was in-between the subject's distinct positioning I clearly recall. Furthermore, during some other brief intervals, partial ground vegetation blockage was also a factor.   --At no time was the encounter a scary experience. If anything, it was very intensely ""surreal"" watching ""one"" through an imager as I have so many other humans & Pacific Northwest animals. Part of the absent fear likely also stemmed from the clear visual distance contrast from the subject and myself and being psychologically comforted that so many of my companions were nearby.  --Although you can't interpret actual hair from 30-50 yards with this thermal unit, there did seem to be some hair shade (as have some other large mammals I've seen from a similar distance on certain nights) and the subject was undoubtedly void of any clothing. From 50 yds that night while doing the comparison and measuring the subject's distance from me, Paul G's clothing could be easily discerned through the unit as he wore a winter wardrobe with a checkered flannel, vest and beanie. (Note Paul G was measured and compared from roughly 50 yards when he stood at subject's initial positioning and his clothing was easily discernible, the majority of where I watched the subject was about 33 yards).    --I saw nothing indicating the subject witnessed was a female (not extremely wide hips, no discernible breasts etc) and based on size/behavior, it's my opinion the subject was likely a young adult male.   ---Based on the agile, effortless movements of the subject both on the ground and standing up behind the tree in the beginning of the encounter, coupled with its profile appearance, I fully believe I saw a more ""ape-like animal"" being then my preconceived notion of what a sasquatch might appear like or actually be.   --One month after the sighting, a local friend informed me that a boy scout master he knew personally & his troop had had a late afternoon sighting around 4:00 PM on August 19th (the day after my encounter) about 3-5 miles as the crow flies up-country from our camp location near a small lake. Coincidentally, our camp experienced nothing unusual our last night (August 19th). Several months later, the same friend also stated that he'd driven by our camp location and saw several hunters butchering and skinning elk right in broad daylight. Not uncommon during hunting season in that location I've been told.   --The area continues to be a hot area as one of our WA-BFRO researchers had an almost identical but more brief & distant thermal sighting with the same X200xp unit, 1/4 of a mile from this location about 10 months later. On that expedition, several people reported much of the stealth & dexterous behavior I'd witnessed the previous August and emailed or called to inform me upon returning home.

Please feel free  contact me if you need to.,Aberdeen,Hwy 105,"I was driving home in January of 1995 from Aberdeen, Washington to Westport, at around 9:00pm on State Hwy 105.  It was dark, foggy and kind of misty.  I was approx. one mile from the Stafford Creek Correctional Facility, on a long straight uphill  stretch of the road.  The lights of the prison turnoff were backlighting the crest of the hill.  There were no other cars of the road.  The road is a two lane road, with wide shoulders that could easily be additional lane width, so in essence the road is 4 lanes wide. I could easily see the road due to the backlighting and my headlights and foglights on my car. 	When I was about half way the hill, a figure stepped onto to the road from the bank, moving from the south to the north.  The north would lead to the harbor.  This figure was quite large, larger than any man that I have ever seen.  He had a large rounded head shape, long arms that reached well below his waist line.  His strides were huge.  He swung his arms opposite of the feet he was moving.  He cleared the roadway in 2 strides, and moved into the brush on the bayside of the road.  I could not make out any physical details or features of this figure other than the ones I have described. I could and still do each time I go past this location, look to see if the animal path that he was following is still there, and it is. 	For a long time I kept quite about this.  I am not who likes to be in the public eye.  But now that I have shared this with some friends, they encouraged me to report this sighting.

Myself and a friend were driving from Grand Forks, BC to Republic, Washington to do some shopping. It was early afternoon and I was the driver. I don't remember exactly, but I know it was shortly after we crossed the border on Highway 21 in Washington state. About 1/4 mile in front of us, something dashed across the highway. It came out of dense forest from the west and ran across the road heading east into more dense forest. I remember it being hair covered and dark brown to black. It didn't look like a bear because it was to lean and long. It was running partially on two legs and all four legs. There were no distinct pointed ears that I could see and thought it was too dark in color and too large to be a cougar. We both didn't even consider a sasquatch at the time and figured it was a mutation of some sort of animal. Not until years later as I read more on the internet did I entertain the idea it may have been something else. Nothing distinct I can tell you otherwise, but what I know of wildlife it was NOT a bear, cougar, deer, elk, moose; at least not what you would normally expect them to look like. The encounter lasted only moments as it dashed across the road in front of us.

The new trail, not the old one.","Silverton, Granite Falls",Mt Loop Hwy,"On a hike from Barlow Pass through Monte Cristo up to Silverlake my girlfriend and I had a strange experience. On the lower part of poodle dog pass there is a set of steep switchbacks in the trail. It was logged a few years before but was too steep to see above us on the trail. All of a sudden verything got real quiet. All the birds stopped singing. Then we heard a whooping noise. It started about 100 yards away above us on the hillside. We stopped and listened. The noise continued about every 2 minutes and got closer and closer. Once it got within about 30 yards away directly above us, it was really loud. We could smell something that was like a dirty wet dog smell. I pulled my sidearm. I did not remember ever hearing anything like this before and was concerned we were about to be attacked by something big. We sat waiting on the trail for about 5 minutes after the last noise. I was scanning the hillside above us but could not see or hear any movement. The birds started singing again and the smell went away. My girlfriend has less time in the woods than I so she asked me what that was. I calmly stated it was ""just a bigfoot, but he's gone now"". I was kind of kidding to make her relax but not sure I was wrong. We slowly continued up the trail. It was dry hard gravel and dirt so there were no tracks. We did not see anything so we went on up to the lake and had a good time. Once we got home I went to the BFRO site and listened to the sound recordings. One of them was exactly what we heard. The hairs on my neck stood up. What ever made that noise in the recording was what we heard. Also I thought the smell could be some type of plant that smelled like a dog and that was why it was called poodle dog pass. I looked around at the plants but did not see any that smelled like that wet dog. At the top of the trail near the lake there is some stinky plants but they are different than what we smelled.

On the morning of Tuesday, August 4th, around 8:00am, I was sitting in our sleeper compartment, on the port side of the train as it exited the long, Cascade Tunnel. I was just relaxing with my head back against the seat, looking out the window, letting the scenery pass by. The train was moving about 40mph and the landscape rose sharply up the mountain. (I was facing toward the rear of the train.)      About a mile west of the tunnel exit, I suddenly glimpsed a huge figure, standing in the trees, up the grade about 50 to 75 feet from the train!! The woods were quite dense and I only saw the figure for a brief moment but it was unmistakably a Bigfoot!!  He, (it) was standing on the sharp incline, looking down at the train, with his right hand on an Aspen tree!! (Because of the speed of the train, I only glimpsed it but Im positive of what I saw!!!!)     The area seemed to be very remote, desolate and wild!! A minute or two later, the landscape dropped off into a steep canyon where I could view the Skokomish river below. It looked to be full of large boulders and the flow was quite rapid and steep.      The Empire Builder passes this same spot daily. It occurs to me that this animal might have developed some curiosity with the train and may visit the spot quite often. It was quite a shock to glimpse him!!! Quite a thrill as well!! Of course, I exclaimed to my wife immediately.

Walking with our packbacks that probably weighed about 70 lbs. a piece. We left Seattle thinking that we were going all the way to Santa Cruz, Ca. However we did not plan on leaving in the middle of the night from Long Beach... we had a room that we were hanging out with a couple of girls we had met earlier at the bar. Well after a few hours of drinking things suddenly turned nasty. So Joe and I decided that it was best to get out of town. We had Astoria, Oregon on our next desination stop. However we had no idea we would be heading there in the middle of the night. It was late July so we had no problem worrying about rain or cold weather. It was a crystal clear night walking down Hwy. 101 at around 2:30 in the morning. We were trying to hitch hike but at that time in the early morning there was not much traffic. We walked for miles, however we were relieved just knowing we got out of town and away from those wicked girls. Whew ! So now we have walked to IIwaco, Wa. and it's pitch black out. The only light we had to go by was the light of the stars above. It was a beautiful sight. We were laughing and joking when suddenly we heard a growl that instantly stood the hairs on our neck up in a frenzy. Joe nor I had ever heard such a growl like what we heard that night. It was frightening and I thought that it just might be the end. I looked at Joe and he looked at me, and I swear all I could see was the whites of his eyes.

53077,3453,26447,2005 2009,Summer,August,WA,Yakima County,Exact location omitted upon request.,Trout Lake,BIA 208 RD,"Never saw anything but 4 years ago my friend, his son and I went camping up near Mount Adams ( A very remote campground) and we were hearing strange screams right before nightfall. Shortly after dark we could hear something messing around on the outskirts of our camp, breaking large branches and such. Around 12am or so my friend was going to bed and unzipped the tent and something very large jumped and ran off from behind the tent. Whatever it was shook the ground to point that I could feel it from about 15 feet away. Later that night I awoke to garbage cans being hit or thrown..at first far off but moving closer over a few minutes time. Then I heard something walking at the edge of camp and it grunted loudly. I had woke up my friend and his son and without my being aware he said a really loud ""BOO"" as I was intently listening for sounds in the forest this scared the holy # out of me.....about had a heart attack. We heard no more sounds that evening.   Fast forward to this years trip.......same camp.....   Our first two nights were un-eventful. But our last night was not.  My friend, his 20 year old Son, my 8 year old Daughter and I were at the same camp. My friend, because of the previous experience, decided to do a little tree knocking, there were no replies. An hour passed and we began to hear screams. First we heard it off in the distance to our south and 3-4 minutes later it was to the NW. I am not sure if whatever it was was traveling or if it was getting a reply from the other location. We probably heard these calls 3 times. All was quiet for a couple of hours.  After dark we began hearing something around camp. We heard what sounded like very large branches being broken out in the forest. We shined flashlights out in the direction of the sounds and it would be quiet for a little while. Well this went on for 3 hours or better and we decided to go to bed. My friend, my Daughter and I were sleeping in a little RV and his 20 year old Son in a tent as he was being brave and said he was not freaked out by the noises. Everyone drifted off to sleep except me as I was listening to see if anything came into camp. Aprox. and hour passed and I heard what sounded like something running and breathing very heavy, with an almost grunting with each breath (kind of hard to explain) going right beside the RV and it sounded rather large. I actually thought bear for a moment. I listened intently but heard nothing. Now this night was a full moon and the windows on one end of the RV were faced in a way that allowed the moonlight to shine through them (These windows are aprox. 5-6 feet from the ground). While sitting there listening for any more noises the level of light decreased and I could notice the change in light through these windows. I could see no shape however. (I thought cloud? But this was a cloudless night and the timing of the thing running a few moments before made this a little less possible.) I wanted to look out, but the position in the RV that I was sleeping in would have taken a lot of movement and to be honest I was having these thoughts that if I was to look out that I would see a face staring back at me. I just listened to make sure that my friends Son was not being attacked. I wanted to wake up my friend but did not want my Daughter waking up. I heard no more sounds for a while and eventually fell asleep.  I had been sleeping for a while and was awakened to the RV shaking and something trying to get in through the doors. I heard knocking and my friends Son yelling ""open the GD door"". He said he had been sleeping and was woke up by banging on trees and heard something running in the woods around the tent. He said that he heard something next to the tent and that this side of the tent went dark. He said that he was listening and heard what he thought was his Dad say my name and then laugh. He said that the voice sounded very close to his Dad's but he could tell it wasn't. He said that this is when he ran for the RV with a big stick in his hand. We heard nothing else this night.   The next morning my friend went a little ways up a trail and knocked on a tree and kept hearing a series of whistles in the trees.  Now I am not sure what this was as we did not see anything. The nearest campers to us were aprox. a mile away on the opposite side of the lake. They were a family with Grand parents and did not seem like they would have done all this for a practical joke on complete strangers in the middle of the night and I would think we would have caught a glimpse of them in our flashlight beams earlier.

We hiked about 2 1/2-3 hrs to a small alpine lake. During the first day, after we made camp, my buddies and I were goofing off throwing large rocks (which may have attracted it???).  That night, I would guess around 3:30 am, I heard a faint knocking in the woods.I laughed at the idea of it being a bigfoot at first, and then it got closer, and closer, and closer until i knew something was out there. It got around 100 yards away from the camp, and went on for about an hour! At the end of the hour I thought I heard return knocks on the adjacent ridge, but can't be sure it wasn't an echo. The following morning I told my fellow campers what I heard. We found cougar tracks around the area, and they attributed the noises to that, but I knew it was no cougar banging things together.  The last night in camp, everyone was a little on edge. One because I kept insisting on what I heard, and two because there was a cougar in the area. We heard a stick crack in the woods, and figured it was a good idea to go in the tent for the night. A few hours later, around 1:30 to 2 am two of use heard something walking along the rocks down by the lake (50-75 yrds). Shortly after that we both heard something hit the tent. I don't know what it was, possibly a small stone. The next morning, we woke up and went to where we heard something walk across the rocks, and found tracks! At first I thought black bear, because of the size (not huge for a ""bigfoot""), but a closer look, I realized it was not a bear. There was no front paw tracks, no claws, and they weren't the shape of a bear. It looked a lot like a person's foot but, when I stood in the mud next to it, I sank 1/4 in into the mud. These were probably 2in in the mud! So what ever it was, it was heavy! I would guess around 400lbs, since I was 185lbs.   There were 6 or 7 tracks total. I took a few pictures, and would love to forward them on to you guys to get your opinion.","One the way down the mountain, we took a short cut. I saw some unusual scat.

After the first day of hiking into Indian Heaven Wilderness and spending a cold night at Elk Lake, I decided to hike to a lower elevation near Forlorn Lakes in which I camped on the second night (GPS N45 57.889 W 121 45.536).  I was outside a designated camping site about 200 meters west in a small valley that paralleled road Nf6035.  No one was occupying the camp grounds nearby that night and it was a very quiet night, until I was awaken with what I describe as three consecutive whooping yells followed by a guttural scream that lasted for about 3 seconds.  It was very loud.  Startled, I remember looking at my watch at the time and it was about 0230hrs.  After the whooping calls, I heard very faint distant calls or howling (not whooping).  The source of the scream was definitely coming further up valley I was camped in (maybe 200-300 meters away).  I stayed awake for a couple more hours in my tent and heard nothing more during the night.  I hiked alone for the three days, therefore no further calibration can be offered from another witness.

Keep going east past Toutle 2 to 3 more miles and the dirt road is to your left. right before a shell gas station that would be on your right. ",Toutle,Hwy 504,"All I have to say is I have never been more scared in my life. I have been a hunter for fifteen years now, knowing, and enjoying the woods more than anywhere else on this planet.    This incident happened saturday night, Sept. 12 down a gated logging road above a fish hatchery. It was elk season for bow hunting, and my buddy wanted to go try for an elk. I knew my other buddy was already down hunting elk near castle rock, so I said lets go down there. Since I only hunt modern firearm, I was not hunting elk, but I brought my rifle because bear season was open. We got down there saturday morning about four a.m. . We did a morning hunt, then took a break back at camp during the middle of the day. For our evening hunt we decided to head east past the town of Toutle about two to three miles. Right before a shell station on your right, we took a left. We drove for a little while until we came across a fish hatchery. We decided to turn around and park at a gate right up the road from the fish hatchery. We all walked in together (4 of us total). When we came to a Y in the road we decided to split up. We continued walking, and thats when I kept hearing something walking in the woods to my right. I mentioned to my buddy that something was pacing us in the woods, so we left that road and headed down an old grassy side road that hadnt been used in a while. When we got to the end of the road I stepped off the road to look down an embankment (trying to see the river)and thats when I heard a deep rumble of a growl, and it seemed to be right next to me. I signaled my buddy to come quick, and I kept looking in the brush, but couldnt see anything. We sat there for a minute, then we heard this thing move around, but it never came out of the brush. We decided to leave that spot and head back to a little clearing we had seen on the way in. I also noticed that all the animal sign in the area was old. There was no fresh tracks or feces of any kind that I saw in the area, which discouraged us since we were looking for elk. We went back to the clearing and sat there until it was dark. Since our other buddies went further up the road than us, we went back to the Y in the road and waited for them. When it became pitch black and they hadnt returned, we decided that we better head toward the truck. As we were walking, I heard the brush move a couple of times, again to my right. I said to my buddy, it sounds like something is in there. He said he had heard that, so we continued walking and listening. Then it seemed to get louder, like someone was just walking through the brush without trying to be quiet. For about a half mile, this thing, whatever it was, paced us and would not leave, no matter how loud we got. We walked the rest of that half mile back to back. I had a flashlight thats built into my hat, and I had that aimed into the woods with my gun pointed right in that direction. When we got back to the truck, our other two buddies were already in his truck with it running. They said they had popped out onto the main road and walked back to the truck from another direction.   I want to note, whatever it was that was pacing us sounded way bigger than a cougar. I would also say that it wouldnt be a bear, since bear tend to be skiddish, and will usually run away from you. The growl that I heard was very deep, but not loud. It was a low rumble that seemed to shake me. Like I said before, I love the woods, and spent my whole life getting out camping, fishing, and hunting. I have never had something like this happen to me before. The only animal I saw the whole time was a bat, and that was when it was almost dark. I didnt even notice a bird the whole time we were down this road.

We had just pulled up at our spot and were unoading our gear when we immediatly started hearing a strange sound coming from the treeline behind us. It was a whooping, tongue clicking type of sound and it was really creepy. Reminded me of the ape cage at the zoo except for the weird sound at the end.   We started making similar sounds back at it and it started answering us. Then, we heard it walking north in the treeline while continuing to make the sound.  We grabbed our guns and jumped back into the truck.   It made it's way around to the other side of where we were but never stepped out into the open. After a few minutes, we heard and felt a thud on the road about 20 feet from our truck. We locked and loaded our guns and went to check it out.   There was a small boulder in the middle of the road that was not there a few minutes before. I could tell it had been thrown there due to the fresh indents in the ground and marks on it. We scanned the area and the sounds started again, this time from the treeline on our right.   The fog was lifting and we walked towards the area the sounds were coming from. All of a sudden, we heard something very big moving through the forest away from us. It was breaking tree branches and we could hear it walking through the underbrush. We headed back to the truck and got in to talk about what had just happened. We were both freaked out and our adrenaline was really pumping. We stayed in the truck for a while until the sun came up shortly afterward and started burning off the fog. We briefly looked around the area but didn't find any sign. We both knew it had to be a sasquatch and decided to leave the area and hunt somewhere else.

The rest of the drive is brush and trees however my parents have doen selective logging so its quite a bit different then in 1980.",Winlock,Hart rd,"  After reading the incodent that happened to the four hunters in Kid Valley Toutle area, I feel I have to describe my encounter with what I thought was a Bigfoot in 1980 when my family and I had just moved here from California.    We live in Winlock Lewis County  off of the Hart Rd.  Back in 1980 our property and the surrounding acres were undeveloped and just Fir trees , Cedar trees, and lots of scrub brush .  Also there is a swamp at the end of our driveway.  My family owns fifteen acres .  Anyway our driveway ran half a mile right next to the pipeline and there was thick brush and trees on either side of it.  One day about 5 pm after school I was walking up our driveway and I heard something in the brush just off to my left.  I had seen deer, rabbits , porcipines, possums,and whylee .  But this was different.  This creature was walking just off my left side and staying with me, the faster I walked, the faster it walked.  You could tell it was a bi-pedal creature by the way it was walking.  As I got closer to the last 100yrds it stayed back and then it was gone.  That night my sister and I were sleeping in our half built home in sleepig bags on the floor.  About 2am this sound came from the woods behind our home that was like a Ape (it was a woop-woop, kind of sound) only so loud and unlike anything Ive ever heard before. Then ofter the woops- I we heard this long drawn out wailing cry, that was sad sounding to me.    Considering what had happened to me during the previous day, I have to think they are conected.  Since that day and that night I never heard the sound again, nor has anything ever followed me like that , up or down the driveway.  I almost think whatever it was , was upset we were developing that property.  I have hunted and fished my whole life and never have heard or seen the trees bend right next to me as something walked with two legs right next to me , yet unseen.  Nor have I heard the sounds of that night.  I have seen all the animals that live here and I have photographed and hunted them all.  I am 43  now  and have no reason to bring this up.  The only reason I am is so maybe others will realize what is happening to them when something like this happens.  I knew what it was yet I was 14 yrs old  and my parents would of laughed it off as nothing.  To this day I know that Bigfoot followed me up my driveway and then Bigfoot let me know what he was by the calls in the middle of the same night.  If you heard these sounds you would of thought the woops where a Orangatang swinging in the trees, until you heard the deep hollow crys after.  These are what sold me.  That cry is definately only made by The big guy himself.  Thanks for your time.  Hunters be aware of what is all around you and what could happen to you.    Thankyou, and enjoy the great wildrness we are priveledged to live next to.    The area the four hunters experienced their encounter was right above the Green River Hatchery and I have frequented that log rd many times.  I know it like the back of my hand.  As I read the documentation of what happened it gave me chills .  Thankyou for believing in the truth and what is really out there.  Karin",Just the tree tops swaying as the creature followed me .

The dog ran 50 feet away from our sleeping site on the beach to the ridge that separated the N and lower beaches. There were sounds of grappling/contact between my dog and the animal. I thought it was a raccoon that my dog had attacked but when I ran to the area underneath the ridge I saw an enormous figure in the dark. The first words to come out of my mouth were ""identify yourself!"" The figure made no growling sound, no sound as it moved, and had no backpack or headlamp. I think it kicked the dog to get away from it. After my friend comes up behind me and grabs the dog somehow, I manage to find the headlamp after 5 minutes. Before we can turn it on and look at the ridge, my friend looks over my shoulder and sees a human figure/torso approach the top of the ridge, set its hand down on a large rock next to it, and then disappear. He remarked about the size of its arms in comparison to the rest of its body. During the initial struggle, my friend also notes a sound he heard. It was an elk-like horn sound that was similar to moaning. I didn't feel like the sound was directed at me but we were in a cove and the figure was fleeing - sounds bounce around. My friend also suggested the idea that the figure ran UP the ridge at a 35 degree angle which is not possible for a human. I convinced myself that it was a human assailant coming to steal our backpacking gear... Yet the figure did not identify itself, was not wearing a headlamp, and somehow scaled the cliff in pitch black.

53011,3625,28123,1995,Summer,August,WA,Clark County,"This incident occured on our rural, somewhat wooded lane, within sight of our house.",Yacolt,,"As usual for my afternoon activity, I left the house to pick thimbleberries.  I was approximately fifty yards away from the house, and had been devouring berries for no more than three minutes.  It was then that an enormous creature stood up suddenly, from what I presume to have been a squatting position, from behind the hedge of thimbleberries, no more than three feet away from me.  Although I was only two years old at the time my memories of the incident remain quite clear.  The creature was covered in thistly stark white fur.  Its build consisted of exceptionly broad shoulders, long burly arms which dangled at its sides, and a waist easily twice as large I was.  The whole appearence gave it a rather squarish appearence.  For the three or so seconds that I remained there I stood petrified by how large the monster was.  I didn't look up to see the monster's face, but my peripheral vision told me that it had a humanish-shaped head and that it touched a twig on the tree behind it.  After those few second passed, I ran.  I ran back to the house as fast as I could.  I was terrified.  Looking back and wondering what it might have been, I was looking on Youtube watching various bigfoot documentaries when one showed a clip of a white creature very much similar to the one I had encounted many years ago.  Only now do I know that what I had encounted was a sasquatch.  ","Various members of the family have had vaguely unsettling experiences in the woods/creek near our house over the years which might well point to a sasquatch's presence (sounds of large unseen animal moving slowly through the brush, bad smells, dogs freaking out, feeling of ""the creeps"" when out alone in the woods, etc.) but nothing as concrete as what [witness] saw.  There are also numerous recorded sightings by others in this vicinity over the years.","A note from [witness'] mom:  While no one else in the family saw the animal that frightened him, I do well remember him running into the house, quite terrified and almost incoherent, saying he'd seen a ""big white thing"" on the other side of the bushes.  We had, at the time, a white standard poodle named Charlie, and when I asked him if perhaps he'd just seen her instead, he denied it vehemently, exclaiming, ""How could Charlie have got that big?!""  I went out to see if I could find any trace of anything, but the ground was baked hard and there were no tracks of any sort.  An acquaintance suggested a day or two later that I look for hair caught on a branch, which I did, but I found nothing.  Less than a week later, a cougar was spotted in our neighbor's field, so I thought perhaps this was what my son had seen, or perhaps a deer, with bright sunlight shining on its fur, making it seem white.    While we couldn't determine what he actually saw, the effect on him was unmistakable.  For days, he would not go out of the house.  If we had to drive somewhere, he insisted that both my husband and myself held his hands while we went from the front door directly to the car, and even then, he was obviously spooked and nervous.  Eventually he did go outside with his older siblings to play again, but it was many weeks before he'd venture out of the yard or go play alone.  This all happened when he was 2 1/2 years old, so he didn't have the vocabulary to fully describe his encounter, but there was no doubt that something traumatic had indeed taken place.    For years, we referred to this mysterious incident rather jokingly as ""[Witness'] big white thing"" and didn't think too much about it.  Then, a few months ago, when an alleged bigfoot sighting on the east coast made the news, [witness] and I looked the subject up on your website and also looked at clips on you-tube.  I still had not made the connection, and I don't know if [witness] had, either.  But when we saw accounts of white sasquatches being spotted, I looked at [witness] and he looked at me, and I just let out an ""Oh, my goodness!""  I asked him to describe the incident for me again, what he remembered of it, now that he was older, to see if any light could be shed on it.  I had always thought he saw an animal move past him on the other side of the bush, but he clarified that for me, saying, ""No, Mom, it ROSE UP from the other side of the bush.""  This also struck a chord from what I later read on your website.  He also says that, to this day, it remains the most terrifying thing he has ever encountered.  He won't even watch bigfoot documentaries now because they bring back frightening memories.  I also asked him if, at the time this happened, he had even heard of ""bigfoot"" or ""sasquatch"" and had any idea what was meant by these terms.  He said he had, but his concept of bigfoot was a giant man, like Paul Bunyan.  The fact that he didn't have any preconceived ideas about encountering a sasquatch as a tall, furry, thick-set animal just adds credence to his story, in my opinion.","Some are listed on your own website.  We're within a mile of Rotschy Road, where another young boy reported seeing a sasquatch some years back, and about a mile from the Yacolt little league field, where there was apparently another sighting.  We had not known of these sightings previously, but many people who live up here in the north county have their own bigfoot stories to tell.

As I tried to focus on the location of this ""event"", I recognized that there was a pair of ""eyes"" looking directly at me. This creature was moving from my left to my right, staring at me. It was evident to me that ""it"" could see me clearly. I was frozen in place and panic set in immediately. I even crouched down in the bushes to try to hide myself. This ""thing"" kept moving and eventually moved out of our area. When it left, the odor disappeared, there was no more tree branches breaking, and I was petrified. I know this sounds like a load of crap - but, this happened and I have no reason to even mention this after all these years.But, do with it what you want. I just thought I'd let you know about my expereince. Thanks for your time. (Name edited out)",Not that i can remember now.

We had dinner, an evening walk and then to bed in our seperate tents.  I was cuddled up with my dog when all of a sudden a very loud earie whooping call burst through the quiet night, awaking me and the dog.  My dog growled and flipped himself over & broke the tent pole. He was very agitated, nervous and couldn't calm down. The whoop sounded longing, lonely or lost in tone.  It was definatly a female tone, the whoops went ""whooop whooop whoop, whoop whoooop.."" then would stop for about 15-20min, then again ""whooop whoooop...."" on and on for about 2.5 - 3hrs.  The noise came from up above the campsite away from the Lake.  It sounded really close but could tell it was far away, perhaps about 1- 2 blocks away.  It was difficult to tell due to the woods, lake and projection of the very loud voice.  I thought it could be an owl but no owl sounds like that, then I thought maybe an Elk but once again I've never heard an elk like this before. I couldn't go to sleep that night due to my dog wouldn't calm down, he was on alert all night until it finally stopped. I was petrified and was up all night wondering if this creature making the noise was coming to visit us in our tents. When I woke up my friend had heard the same noise and wondered if it was an injured dog howling but then when I mentioned sasquatch whoops she had an Ah-hah moment and realized no dog could make this noise. Others campers gathered in the AM discussing the mysterious noise, some said it was a bard owl, spotted owl, a coyote, an elk, but I felt in my bones it was the same noise I had heard from a recording on BFRO site (1974 Ron Morehead Sierra Nevada whoops & knocks) Camp Cushman is most likely being closed due to some lawsuit w/the native americans over land use. ","The day after the incident we walked a bunch of trails back behind the campsite, walking along the lake front.  As we were walking away from the lake my dog stopped abruptly and sniffed the air like he smelled the best smell ever. THen immediately after he sniffed the air, my friend & I got hit in the nose w/the worst pungent smell.  It was like a dead animal soaking in swamp water for months.  As we walked it suddenly went away and appeared again about 20 ft up the trail. ",Besides myself and my friend whom was camping w/me.

53041,3636,28301,2000,Fall,October,WA,Lewis County,Its litterally just on the edge of town in morton. If you go to morton just go to the graveyard and thats where it was at.,Morton,Highway 12," I dont know where to begin with this, other than to apologize for this being such an old story. I hope that it isnt useless to you. I guess I need to tell you about the area I lived in first before I start into the rest of the story because there is a lot to it, and I think it will be confusing if I just stumble into it.   In Washington state there is a town called Morton. It is an old logging community and it has a population of around 1500. It is surrounded on all four sides by mountains, and is located along highway 12, about 45 minutes east of Interstate 5 past Mayfield lake and north of rife lake. The town is only about 1 square mile in all and when you look at road maps it is truly in the middle of freakin no where. In fact, it is about 2 miles south of the southeastern tip of the Snoqualmie national forest. When I lived there though I was 11 years old and I didnt know any of that. I only bring it up now because this asks for information on the area and how to get there.  I lived on 7th street. When you look at the map it is the very first street you come to when traveling east along highway 12, and we were the third house from the highway. Directly across from my house is the Graveyard. It isnt well lit, but there are a few lights, a lot of shrubs, and a few huge trees, as well as a huge hedge wall along the right side of it, when looking at it from my house.  On the other side of the hedge is the power plant, and it is super well lit. There are light posts all over and you can see everything over there. To the left when looking out my window is highway 12, and there is a large hill directly on the other side of the highway. It hadnt been logged when I saw this, but the next year they did some stuff up there. Thats probably not important, but anyway to the meat of this whole thing  Like I said I was 11 or so. My family had moved up from California for work and we took the first place we could get. Im not going to lie the place was a piece of junk. It was drafty and poorly insulated, and whoever lived there before must have had 100 cats they let pee everywhere because it stunk too. It has since been re built a bit but at the time it was a little blue shack that didnt have a bedroom because it had burnt down before we bought it. Because of that I slept on the couch, and my brother slept in the reclining chair. its the north window of the house that I slept next too, facing the street, and I used to sit there at night looking out the window at the stars and hoping deer would come eat my neighbors flowers so I could see one up close. Most people in morton are older, and all my neighbors were elderly the town has the only local hospital so a lot of older folks live there. Anyway, she always complained about the dear eating her roses or something, and I just wanted to see the stupid deer. Having come from Cali, Id never seen one in real life.  So there I was, laying on the couch propped up with my head peeping out from under the curtain waiting for deer. It was a towel actually, we didnt have curtains, but it worked just as well I guess. The towel left about a 4 inch gap at the bottom before the sill where you could see outside without moving the curtain at all. Most nights nothing happened, and it became a habit for me to just look outside. We didnt have cable TV or anything, just the videos my uncle would send us of shows hed recorded, and I couldnt read a book because my brother got mad if the lights were on, so it was the only way I could wind down before I went to bed. Most days I didnt see anything but starts, but one day I saw a deer chillin out there eating grass or something, and I just thought it was the coolest darn thing ever! I watched it for a long time as it just kinda walked around and ate stuff, I guess.  Having seen hundreds of deer since then I kinda laugh thinking about it but MAN was it ever cool at the time. So Im sitting there, watching the deer, and all of a sudden it sticks its head strait up in the air and looks behind it and freezes. Then it took off running, veering left and right and changing directions, but I couldnt see what was chasing it at first, until it ran back towards the mortuary where there is actually some light and then I was even more awestruck because it looked like a bear was chasing it! It was this big, thick, kinda fat looking thing, running on all fours and I couldnt see a tail so I figured it couldnt be a wolf, but man was it ever fast! It was so cool! I never knew bears could run fast and Id certainly never seen one before, and then the deer ran behind the mortuary, around the other side, and back towards my house with the bear right behind it.   The bear was catching up, but then the deer ran right into the road and ran around the hedge into the power plant area, where it just stopped and stood there in the light. The bear didnt follow it, and kinda hung out in the shadows for a while. I could see it moving around but it was all dark. Maybe a minute went by and then the bear walked back towards highway 12 real slow, just taking its time. Well, there was a little ditch before the highway, and then the guard rail and I was watching it walk over it, and thats when it stood up. It just stood up and walked over it, walked across the road on two legs, stepped over the other guard raid, and went up into the hill across from the highway. I had NO idea what to make of it. I knew bears could stand up on two legs but I knew they couldnt walk like that... I mean it just walked right like I would have. I never told anyone about it because I thought Id get in trouble. I had gone to a private Christian school in Cali and so making up stories got you in trouble, and I really didnt want to get detention.  I never told that story to anyone as a real story I should say I have always told my friends its  A monster story and added stuff about huge fangs and stupid stuff because I just needed to get it OUT, you know?  But I didnt want people to think I was crazy I was trying to fit in to a new school  Later in the year I was watching a tape my uncle had sent to us and a comercial for burger king 99 cent whoppers came on. I thought it was stupid because there were no burger kings here, so I muted it and turned my head towards the window. When I looked out the window I saw a pair of eyes looking back at me, glowing from the light of the TV. I was scared and threw my blanket over my head and held absolutely still. I could hear something running away from the window, but I think that may have just been a curious couger Everything ive read about bigfoots, since someone finally told me about them the year after I saw the thing chase the deer in the graveyard, has said that they are very shy and wouldnt come up to a house like that.  Anyway, thats my two stories. I hope they are somehow helpful. I also hope maybe you can give me some insight? I really dont know what I saw still, but the only thing that makes sense anymore is if it were a Bigfoot. ",Nothing before or after either incident,No,"I'm sure there are plenty... i never got introduced to the idea of bigfoot till i moved to there and its a relatively accepted idea around there. In fact I learned about Bigfoot when some bigfoot organization came to our school and tought us about him during one of our classes. That was the first I'd ever learned about bigfoot, and that was about a year after I saw what I did.",Night. It went between well lighted and very dark areas.

Saturday evening we arrived about 8:00 p.m. and after unpacking the car we walked out to road out front of the cabin, and noticed a very heavy musky skunk like odor. Our brown lab ""Sadie"" caught the scent too and started to look around for it, but it seemed to disappear quickly.  About one hour later 9:00ish p.m. I stepped outside with my porch with my dog; hoping to see the planet Jupiter, but it was still behind the trees to our south.   It was then that behind our property to the east in the direction of County Rd 60 I heard three distinct and loud animal calls that made a Whoo-Up! sound. It sounded like a person trying to imitate a bird call. I have never heard a sound like this ever in my life, and I am familiar with several Pacific Northwest animal sounds.   This unnearved me a little, and caught the dog's attention. I quickly moved the dog inside the cabin, and had my wife put on her shoes to come outside and listen. We waited for about 20 minutes, but did not hear the animal calls again. The only sounds we heard then were the neighbors down the road playing some music, and muffled voices.  Bigfoot? I don't know.

Threw my float tube in the back and cruised over to a nearby swamp to change out of my fishing waders and eat a snack. I sat for awhile listening to the frogs, they were so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. I was enjoying a Washington summer night. Out in the dark swamp 6 feet below me about 35 yards away I saw a pair animal eyes moving towards me. I thought I would let this deer just pass and even got excited for a second. As it came near I saw that it would eventually pass my location so I sat and watched. At around twenty yards or less I noticed from the blue/clear eyes that the deer was walking strangely. I got a little nervous and whistled to let it know of my presence and that is when I realized this set of eyes are connected to an animal walking on two legs! After the whistle the animal looked at me and walked off slowly looking over its shoulder. It tripped while looking over its shoulder, I could see the eyes go down then slowly get up again all the while watching me and walked off into the swamp looking over its shoulder. I was honestly freaked. I got out of there and didn't go back for quite some time. Before the incident I doubted the possibility, now I have no doubt of the existence of Sasquatch.

53041,3646,28409,2002,Summer,,WA,Lewis County,,"Winlock, WA.",King Road,"Due to some computer problems, the witness in this case filed his report telephonically with BFRO investigator Charles Lamica.  Below is a synopsis of that interview.  About eight years ago the witness and his wife lived in western Washington, near the town of Winlock.  The couple owned several horses and spent a great deal of time riding them on the trails and logging roads near their home.    One sunny afternoon in late spring or early summer they were riding on a logging road in a wooded area when the witness saw what he describes as a chimp-like animal cross the dirt road in front of them.  According to the witness, the animal was a couple hundred yards in front of him and the sighting lasted only a couple seconds.  He described the animal as Moving fast, using its arms to help it along, exactly like a chimpanzee does.  He said the animal was black in color.  Due to the distance and the short duration of the sighting he didnt get a good look at the animals face.  He remembered the animals arms were Long and skinny, and were much longer than its legs.  He never saw the animal stand up, but estimated that if it stood erect it would have been about five feet tall.  He said the animal moved very fast, About the speed of a loping horse, and disappeared into the vegetation on the other side of the road.  The witness said hes very familiar with bears and is positive the animal he saw wasnt a bear.  He stated, If this was a bear it was a horribly deformed bear.  He felt that such a bear would not have been able to move as fast as the animal he saw.   He further stated that bears seen in profile tend to have a rather horizontal back, while the animal he saw had a steeply slanted back due to the arms being a lot longer than the legs.  He related that bears have a noticeable neck, but the animal he saw seemed to have little or no neck.  After the brief sighting the couple rode their horses to the spot where the animal crossed the road.  At that point the horses became very frightened and hard to control.  The witness says the horses refused to go further and became so unmanageable that they eventually had to turn around and go back the way they had come.  The witness said he and his wife had ridden those horses on that same stretch of road Hundreds of times, and never before or after the sighting did the horses  refuse to move forward.  The witness also related that he has ridden his horses in close proximity to bears and the horses never acted as frightened and unmanageable as when they saw the Chimp-like animal.  The area where the sighting took place was typical western Washington forest with a lot of salal bushes, large ferns, vine maples, and big fir trees.  The area is generally mountainous, although the place where the animal was seen was relatively flat.  The witness said that when he lived in that area it was not uncommon to hear very loud and unusual howls at night.    ","They often heard unusual howls at night.  About one mile from this sighting location the wife once found a strange mound of ferns and sticks. the mound was about ten feet long, four feet wide, and higher in the middle than the sides.  It was in an area where it would be unlikely that humans would have gone to the trouble to create such a mound.",The witness's wife was present but didn't see the animal because the horse she was riding was becoming a bit hard to handle and her attention was focused on the horse.,"Not in this same area, but the witness reported a second sighting which occurred on a summer afternoon about three years ago.  While driving a log loader in a recently logged patch of forest near Mt. St. Helens the witness saw a large red-colored bipedal animal walking near the logging site.  The animal was about 150 feet away from the witness and was simply walking through the slash and downed timber.  The witness said he was so surprised and unable to make sense of what he was actually seeing that he didnt even slow down his vehicle to take a closer look.  He lost sight of the animal after he passed it.  The whole sighting lasted about five seconds.  The next day he returned to the area to look for tracks or sign, but the ground cover was such that no tracks were visible.  He said he had trouble walking through the area and was surprised at how easily the animal seemed to be able to walk through the rough ground.  He described the animal as being at least six feet tall, covered with hair three to four inches in length, having a reddish color similar to an Irish Setter dog.  He remembered it having long arms and massive thighs and rear end.  He said it wasnt fat, but it didnt seem to have much of a waist.  He further said the animal never once looked at him or did anything to acknowledge the presence of the witness.

53045,3658,28485,2010,Fall,November,WA,Mason County,Olympic National Forest just East of the Mount Skokomish Wilderness on Big Creek Trail 827.1,Hoodsport,2419,"On Friday the 5th of November 2010, my family and I decided to go hiking near Lake Cushman. I typically go hiking alone as it gives me opportunity to gather my thoughts and enjoy the outdoors. Seeing as how my wifes birthday was coming up she managed to convince me to take her and our two children along. I had planned a more arduous hike near Mt. St. Helens but given the childrens notable lack of ambition and current weather conditions I elected to drive the hour and a half from our home in Castle Rock to Lake Cushman for a more family friendly outdoor experience.   We arrived at the Big Creek trail near Hoodsport at around 1000 hours and began our hike (trail 827.1 loop). It was a cool day with a light drizzle and visibility was at times no more than 75-100 yards. The hike was rather uneventful and my wife and I both noted that the utter silence of the forest that day was deafening. There was one other car at the entrance to the park so I just assumed they had gone in ahead of us on the same path and had ruined our chances of viewing any wildlife.  At around 1130 hours I heard a truck about 75 yards up the ridge. I looked up just in time to see the cab lights of a logging truck heading up the mountain on road 2419. About 10 to 15 minutes later I heard what I initially thought was another vehicle struggling to climb the road. A couple of seconds later I realized it wasnt a car at all but an animal or possibly another person. It sounded like part howl and part groan. It was difficult to describe other than to say it seemed mournful. This groan/howl lasted about 8-10 seconds during which time I turned to look at my wife and children. The look on their faces said it all. They had heard it as well. Almost simultaneously everyone said what was that. I said I had no idea and we continued on.  At around 1200 hours we approached the Skinwood Creek Bridge. All at once we were stopped dead in our tracks by a horrible odor, which I can only describe as a cross between skunk and ammonia. The odor was so heavy we could taste it and our eyes even began to water a bit. My daughter began to cry and repeatedly begged me to let us return to the truck. I must confess I would have liked to oblige but we were at the half way point and continuing forward seemed to be the most logical course of action.  As we continued on the odor dissipated. We made the turn at the bridge and started back down the trail on the west side. At almost the same point we encountered the odor on the east side of the trail we picked up the scent again on the west side. We continued down the trail and once again the odor dissipated.  The remainder of the hike was uneventful and I dare say we made much better time heading back to the truck. ","Didn't take note of it until after the incident and we were heading back down the trail.....but along with the usual chewed stumps of mushrooms along the trail we found many uprooted with the tops bitten off. I found this unusual for a couple of reasons. First off deer and elk usually bite the tops off at ground level leaving the stump in the ground (of which we observed may). Secondly the uprooted stumps were in the middle of the trail and were left in almost a Hansel & Grettel manner. I collected and bagged one of these uprooted mushrooms. Not sure why...I just found it strange.  I would like to note that I am an avid outdoorsman, and in the countless weeks I have spent in the Washington wilderness (mostly remote locations) I have never encountered anything such as this, let alone on a marked NWS trail.",4 including myself.,No. But then again I wouldn't know how to begin a conversation on the subject.,"Late morning.

53045,3659,28487,2008,Summer,August,WA,Mason County,"Approximately 300 feet from Highway 119, and approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Foothills Park area. ",Hoodsport WA,Highway 119,"One summer night in 2008, I was sitting on the back deck with our dog Icy at about 1 in the morning, because it was too hot to sleep. It was totally silent -- which it normally is around here at night -- and as I sat there on the wooden steps, with Icy sitting on the deck about 3 feet away from me, I heard what at first sounded like a distant siren, seemingly from the north-north-east. (The only thing in that direction from our house is Dow Mountain, with no roads except for dirt logging roads).   Icy's response to sirens is invariably the same: he lifts up his head, pricks his ears, listens intently, and then begins howling, usually in the moment just after the siren becomes inaudible to my human ears. That night, though, his response was completely different. He came quickly to my side and pressed himself against me, sort of hunching himself into an extension of my body. As I listened, I viscerally ""knew"" that what I was hearing was NOT a siren, although it did seem very, very similar to a siren sound.  I remember I was holding my breath -- and my impression was that I didn't start breathing again until the sound had completely stopped -- and I can only hold my breath for about 50 seconds, so that's the amount of time I would guess the sound went on.    The same instinct that told me that I was not listening to a siren also told me that I had never heard this sound before.  Another -- to me -- validating aspect was that my own response to it was out of character, just as Icy's was. Normally I would have sat there for another hour or so, hoping to hear it again. It was so amazing -- and I usually can't get enough of that kind of interesting mysterious stuff. But when the howling ended and I started breathing again, my first impulse was to get inside the house, quietly and fast.   I went online and Googled every kind of indigenous Pacific Northwest animal I could think of: elk, fox, coyote, deer, bear, rabbit, moose, cougar, various owls, other birds -- even wolf, which we purportedly do not have in this area -- and couldn't find any WAV file that even came close. On a chance, I looked up Sasquatch WAV files, and listened to the ones that I could find -- I think there were five -- and one of them, the ""Ohio Howl"", was a dead ringer. When I heard it coming through the headphones, chills started running up my back. That was the sound I'd heard.","Nothing other than the stillness of the air, and the unusual warmth for that time of night.

53053,3689,28716,2010,Winter,March,WA,Pierce County,Location edited to preserve the privacy of the witness,Eatonville,Ski-Park Road,"On March 20th 2010 between 3:30 AM and 4:00 AM I heard a loud scream I had never before heard.  I was awakened abruptly out of a deep sleep when a very loud animal scream made me sit straight up in bed, scaring the hell out of me.  For about 15-20 seconds I wondered if maybe I had imagined it, when suddenly another long, loud screaming came.  It was very loud- and close, and it was obvious by the volume and intensity that it was something big.  I guessed the screaming to be about 10-20 feet away from the house, outside my bedroom, on the lawn.  There is roughly 60 feet of lawn between the house and the woods and the screaming sounded like it was maybe one-quarter to one-third away from the house towards the woods. The hair stood up on my neck when another long, loud scream came, and I wondered what in the hell was doing it?  The volume and intensity was much louder and deeper than a person could possibly make and it wasnt consistent with any animal we have heard here before- Deer, Elk, Bear, Coyote, Cougar, etc. I walked into our living room where I looked out the window hoping to see better, but it was too dark in the yard and I could not see beyond a few feet.  I slid the window open to try to hear anything and about a minute later another loud scream erupted through the night but it now sounded like it was just off our lawn and into the woods.  After this scream there was a series of loud sounds that I can only describe what sounded like distressed grunts, barks, and cries followed by shorter screams.  Almost like something was possibly injured or distressed.  Then to my surprise something screamed back- off into the woods from the right, which I guessed to be a few hundred feet away.  This went on, back and forth about 10 to 15 minutes when I realized our three dogs had not been barking during any of the commotion, which was very unusual.  They always bark at animals and people that come onto the property and usually chase after the animals.  I went to the glass slider door at the back of the house and found all three dogs cowering on the back porch as close to the door as they could get.  They were all scared and acted nothing like normal. I went back to the open window in the living room and listened for a few minutes and noticed the screams and noises were getting further away and deeper into the woods.  The back and forth screaming slowly got further away and then the furthest one quit altogether.  The closest one did a few more screams further into the woods and then it too stopped.  After a while I went back to bed but was awake for a couple hours as I tried figuring out what could have made that kind of noise.  Bigfoot had crossed my mind but I really didnt believe something like that could be- that only happens to other people.  But nothing else made sense of what it could have been. It wasnt until recently when my wife and I talked to a person who told us she knew two people who had seen a bigfoot on our property back in the mid 80s that I began to really think it was possible that Bigfoot was what I had actually heard.  A friend came across this site and told me about it, and I read about other sightings and sounds in the area that made it more plausible.  When I listened to the audio recordings, the hair stood up on my neck once again.  It was the same screams I had heard here! ",none,just myself,Recently we talked to someone that said there was a Bigfoot sighting on our property back in the mid 80s.  Other reports in the Eatonville area over the years are listed on your site.,3:30 AM to 4:00 AM  It was dark.,"We have a forest of Fir, Cedar, Alder, and Maple trees along with thick vegetation.  Deer and Elk trails run through the woods.  Ohop lake is west at a stones throw away.  The woods are thick in this area and the woods where the screams were coming from run to the north for many miles without any buildings or structures, and you could go all the way to Mt Rainier and beyond, and other places from here without ever leaving the woods.",20th
53009,3693,28739,2011,Winter,January,WA,Clallam County,About a mile and a half into the Elwha River Trail.,"Port Angeles, WA",Whiskey Bend Rd.,"My three friends and fellow soldiers recently spent a three day camping trip into Olympic National Forest Elwha River Trail. We had to return to cell coverage, so myself and my buddy headed out of the forest and north on the main trailhead.   The night before was a heavy thunder storm so the trail was very muddy. I was a leading us out and stumbled upon a very clear muddy print of a left foot. I wear a size 11 mens boot and to me this was clearly a size 14-15. The print seemed recent and had clearly defined toes and arch. We only had a cellphone to take the picture with and regrettably only took the one. The tracks, that seemed to be from the same source (none as clearly defined), went on heading north on the trail an additional 25-30 feet.   That night we decided it was in our best interest with the horrible weather to make camp at one of the historical cabins on the trail. We retrofitted a poncho in one of the open windows to shelter us from the rain and wind. We secured it by weighing the bottom half down with a 2x2 piece of wood. During the heaviest gusts of wind it seemed to hold up.   At approx 0100 hrs the tarp was opened and something knocked the piece of wood onto one of my fellow campers. Being woken up by this, I saw the tarp movement with no wind source being observed.  These events could have easily been a bear...  I do note, however, that the large garbage bag that was littered with foodstuff was untouched throughout the night. I include these occurrences to make sure and give you a thorough recording of events substantial or not.

53027,3696,28781,2002,Summer,August,WA,Grays Harbor County,A mile or two north of Moclips on highway 109.,"Moclips, WA",Highway 109,"My son and I were heading north on hiway 109 just north of Moclips, WA.  We were in my pick-up truck and I was driving. It was cloudy, but no rain.  The sun had just set but there was still plenty of light.  109 is a two lane road along the ocean and there wasnt any other traffic, so I was driving sort of slow and enjoying the nice summer evening.    As I was driving, I was enjoying the view to my left and just caught a glimpse of a decent sized animal that darted from right to left across the road and into the left ditch, where I lost sight of it as I drove past.  As I drove I continued to look to my left to take in the view when movement near the road ditch to the left side of my truck caught my attention.  I turned my head to look out the drivers window and saw some sort of animal running on all fours in the ditch to the left beside the back of the truck about 25 feet away.  It was easily keeping up with the truck as I drove about 35 mph.  My mind couldnt identify what sort of animal it was so after a quick look at the road I looked at the animal again.  My instant reaction was that the animal looked like an ape based on how it was built and how it was moving.  Im no ape expert, but Ive seen them in the movies and TV and thats what it looked like.  After another quick look at the road, I turned to view the animal again but it was gone.  We saw it for maybe 10-15 seconds.  It was about 3 feet tall as it ran on all fours, stocky and thick with a dark brownish color.  It had hair/fur of a uniform length of about 3 inches all over.  One of the reasons it reminded me of an ape so much was the way its front legs were longer than its back legs making its hind end lower than its front end as it ran.  Because I could only get short looks at the animal as I was also driving, the face was all a blur and I didnt see any details.   Ive been in the woods and outdoors all my life working, hunting and playing in Washington and Alaska and Ive seen many animals and this was like nothing Id ever seen before.  After the sighting, my son and I drove to a restaurant and tried to make sense of what we saw, but couldnt.  Id filed it away as a mystery until my cousin told me recently that its believed sasquatch young run on all fours and it suddenly made sense.   ",Nothing.,"Two witnesses.

53053,3709,28898,2008,Spring,June,WA,Pierce County,Please read account  ,Greenwater,Fs rd connecting to 410 ,"My husband and I were up off of highway 410, about 5 miles outside of Greenwater (on the FS road right after the fire station on the left side of the road)around the first part of June in 2008.  We had come from Tacoma and I was trying to get my husband acquainted with being in the woods at night, so we headed up to a place I liked to go occasionally to start a fire and cook some food and relax.  It was a site for what looked like an old rock quarry alongside the right hand side of the woods. I chose the spot because it was fairly open to the road and there were also a large number of campers dotted throughout the woods and along the river at the time.  It should also be noted that it was foggy.    We pulled into the muddy rock pit(we were driving a '69 220 Mercedes) drove in about 50 feet and then noticed something in front of the car.  My husband seemed panicked and wondered what the hell it was.  It was gray(light colored)big, human shape, visible right in front of our car no more than 15 feet from the front bumper.  Even though I knew it wasn't human or a known animal, I told him it was a deer's butt and not to be scared. He has stopped the car at this point and then we both witnessed the creature climb up the side of the quarry at a high rate of speed.  He was terrified, but for some reason, I wasn't scared at all even though I had just something unexplainable.  I convinced him to park and we got the stuff out the trunk headed up the other side of the quarry and started the fire.  By the time it was really going it was dark out and we were just sitting and talking.  It also started to rain a little.  I had the unerving feeling that we were being watched.  That was when we saw headlights coming up the road and turning into the quarry.  It was the sheriff.  He stopped at our car then came up the side of the quarry in his truck, shining his search beam on us as he ascended.  After asking what we were doing he left and headed down the side of the quarry in which we had seen the creature earlier.  I noticed about a quarter of the way down he stopped and shone his light into the woods at which time the previously viewed creature was spotted standing at the edge of the woods.  It turned around and headed back into the woods and the sheriff sped down the side of the quarry.  I bet he remembers it, but I don't remember his name.  We left immediatelly. It should also be noted that I didn't feel scared at all and I almost forgot that I had seen the creature until we drove home and my husband reminded me.  It was almost like my mind was trying to dismiss it because I didn't know or could make sense out of what I had seen.","The creature had a gray light covered fur, it was unusually foggy for that time of year, generally weird feeling","Yes, my husband(driving, eating) and a Pierce County sheriff(driving, questioning us)","no, going to research though",dusk and night time.

I have been in Washington since 1959.  I am a mountain man and spent most of my time on horses in high country. I never saw big foot until one day when my son and I went to Tule Lake to do some fishing. We were on the bank fishing and he snuck up on us and watched us fishing but we couldn't see him. Then he walked on around to the other side of the lake. This lake is probably the size of a football field. He came out of the timber and there is a short spread of grass he walked through. Thats when we saw him. My son too I think.  He had taken up residence there for some time because all the animals left the area. It was high in all kinds of wildlife.  I saw him one other time not too far from the lake down on the Nisqually River.  My father saw him on top of Muck Creek hill. I use to tell my friends but they were very skeptical until they asked my son. That boy never lies. Then they were believers.  I am a very good tracker and have gone in look for him.

53019,3728,29045,1986- 2008,Fall,October,WA,Ferry County,,kettle falls,Highway 20,"I have two personal accounts and at least one second hand accounts to report. I was encouraged to share them by a recent aquaintance, Nate H. I would like to be contacted by phone at your convenience to give a more detailed description of the encounters and specific locations. That said, I will briefly describe the incidents. All occurred in Ferry County, Wa.  The first was back in the mid 80's. I was 20 or 21 and would pack in by myself on 3-4 day mule deer hunts in the high country. I was camped mid-mountain overlooking the Sherman Creek drainage. At dusk I heard a long ""howling"" call from far below me that literally caused my hair stand on end. It started very low and and cresendo'd at a medium level, lasting maybe ten seconds and repeating twice. Oooowwwwuuuuuuu. I have heard everything in the woods, including bull beef cattle, and I knew instinctually what this was. My remaining nights on that hunt were spent sleepless. I never spoke to anyone about it, fearing ridicule.  Four years later I was stationed in SE Alaska and my father in law (an avid hunter) came up to go on a brown bear hunt with me. Late on the night after our life threatening kill of a dandy bruin, we were imbibing in some whiskey in our remote cabin. The comraderie of the hunt coupled with the whisky loosed our tongues and I told him of my experience years prior, with his promise of secrecy. With the same promise from me, he related an actual sighting he had not five miles from where I heard the ""call""  He was a UPS driver and his route took him over Sherman Pass on HWY 20 on a daily basis. It was early spring and he was just below the summit when he saw what appeared to be a long haired ""hippie with a backpack"" trucking through the tall brush up ahead on the west side of the HWY. He slowed down and as he came abreast of it (about 20 mph)their eyes met. It was instant recognition an the BF did a 90 down the hill. As to my knowledge, he has never told another soul.  Jump ahead appx 20 years. My hunting partner and I were driving a remote section of road after dark to try and find concentrations of deer tracks to hunt some new areas about twenty miles from Canada and forty miles north of the aformentioned incidents. There was appx 16"" of snow and maybe 4"" of new over the last vehicle tracks. We came upon a strange set of extremely large tracks and got out to investigate, thinking they were cougar. However, these were unmistakably bi-ped, and HUGE!I wear size 13 and they were at least 4"" longer than my insulated boot footprint. In addition, the stride was so long that we had to jump to mimic the distance between them. The tracks followed the road for appx a mile, mainly holding to the ""uphill"" side of the road and sporadically moving to the downhill side when the view was more expansive. They finally dove off the road into a creekbottom and we couldn't locate where they exited the creek. Keep in mind that it is 10 degrees f so no human is gonna take a walk in a stream!   I have an entry in Boone & Crocket, so I hope that lends some credibility to my assertions. I would love to speak with you via phone to give a more detailed description.     ",,,,,,2008

",Chehalis,Senn Rd.,"I lived in Chehalis Washington on Senn Road across from Warehouser land. I had 2 close contact experiences as a child there. The fist one happened when I was 11. My grandparents were visiting and had their camper parked next to our house. My brother and sisters were out with them playing cards, my mom and dad were in their bed room and I was playing the piano in the living room . Behind me is a LARGE picture window looking out onto a neighbors field and beyond that is Warehouser land. As I was playing with my back turned to the window. I had a ""Someones watching me feeling"" I turned around and there, approximately 10 feet in front of me,watching me play piano, is this hairy creature. He was taller than the picture window because he was bending to see in. His arms were long, his eyes were reddish brown as was his hair. It became darker on his main body, but was lighter on his face and chest area. His upper body was pretty buff. It took me a while to scream as I was frozen in fear for a bit but when I did finally scream he took off. My dad ran out and saw the back of it running away. my grandparents and sisters in brother saw it run by the camper and then dad saw it run through our field to the creek.So that's 6 people that saw it. I of course, having the closest encounter.   The second sighting at the same house. My best friend was staying the night and I had made my bedroom in the back of the truck with the topper on it. (It was Summer) The truck was parked a little away from our house by the barn. We were both in bed talking and suddenly the light from the house was blocked out. I saw a face in the topper side window looking at us. At first I thought it was one of my siblings but as my eyes adjusted to the light change I realized it was the hairy face I had seen in the picture window months before. I then froze and whispered to my friend also not to move. It watched for what seemed like an eternity. Maybe waiting for us to move,which we didn't! Then it moved towards the open back gate window, to our Horror. I thought it was coming to get us,but it never showed up back there. When we got up the courage to get out and go to my house. We told everyone what had happened. They had all been together watching a movie. No one there had been away from the rest.Those are my 2 accounts. I'd like to add that there was intelligence in the eyes and some sort of non verbal communication.

Approximately 3 miles northeast of Highway 2.,Gold Bar,Highway 2,"I was hiking, with my dog, at Wallace Falls State Park on 4/26/11. I started the hike at about 11:30am and there were only two other vehicles in the entire parking lot. I had hiked passed the upper portion of the falls, following an old logging road up to Wallace Lake. I only saw one other hiker coming down from the falls lookout. At approximately 2pm, my dog and I were walking towards the lake (it was about 1.5 miles away). We heard a very strange, humanoid yell come from across a marshy bog area. We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly ""yoouuuuuu!!!"". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct ""yooouuuuu!!"". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence. Being miles up alone in the wilderness, I didn't want to John Wayne across a bog into thick brush to investigate. It was the first time I've ever heard such a unique sound while out in the forest.

I listened and then I heard this strange animal cry. it sort of made a Mraaa...Mraaa...Mraaaa.. sound. I could tell it was coming from down in the stream area. I thought possibly a bear cub or bobcat? It was definitely in distress. then I could hear the sound of rocks smashing onto the gravel bar as if someone was picking up big boulders and smashing the rocks. i thought my partner might have found some large agates and that is why he was calling me. (we love to rock hunt this area) but again I heard the animal cry..Mraa Mraaa.. and more rocks being smashed. I started to walk to our trail (about 30 feet away) to see if I could see my partner or what was making the noise when i could hear the brush crashing and some mumbling noise. i thought ""who the heck is Tom talking to?? Is someone down there killing animals? did he have an encounter with something? someone? and is he fending it off? with rocks?"" But the mumbling just sounded like they were having a conversation. I walked to the edge of the brush where the trail leads down to stream, I couldn't see anything (pretty brushy) and It was raining. I had a horrible cold/sore throat and didn't feel like walking down the trail and upstream to meet him (which is what I usually do to look for rocks) not to mention I was feeling a bit uneasy. Something kept telling me to NOT go. I was even afraid to holler his name. I had no idea what was going on in the stream and who or what was there.   I started back to the truck and heard the brush behind me crashing. I turned thinking it was Tom..and.. no one. each time i started back to the truck (only about 30 feet away) the brush would crash again. still not Tom. i just jumped inside the truck and waited. He was now running a bit later then normal and i had no idea what i would do. no radio and cell phone service to call for help if he didn't show or was hurt.   It seemed like about 15 to 20 minutes went by when i saw him coming up a different trail (off to my right, not the left where he should be) (from he mouth of boss) I got out to ask him what the heck he had been doing down there and he informed me that when he got to our trail to get out of the stream, there on the gravel bar was a freshly killed deer, steam rising from it and blood coming off it, and the brush was splattered with blood maybe as high as 8 to 10 feet. But the worst part was, the upper torso (stomach to head) was gone...it was ripped in half and there was a bloody trail going straight up our trail, practically in front of our truck and across ridge to boss creek.   I sort of wanted to go down and look at the animal (with him) but my partner wanted nothing to do with it. We got out of the area in a hurry in case whatever came back to get the rest. He said he had never heard any sounds. Just came upon the dead animal. AND did NOT even look for foot prints of any kind. He just wanted to get past it quick. I cannot believe whatever was there nearly walked in front of me with that upper carcass and I did not see it.  my husband and i planned to go back the next day to see if there was anything left but it rained and rained so hard for the next few days that we never got back.  It was over 2 weeks before we could go back to survey that area again. I refused to walk that section. in fact, I didn't want to walk any of it. My partner did. there was nothing on that gravel bar (no bones, no hair, nothing). when I finally did walk that area, i came across a large pile of scat on that same gravel bar. HUGE.. not sure what it was. I left ASAP.  I sent in a report to Fish and Wildlife. we did get radios for our vehicles after that.   ",Several Seasons before (we walk it during chinook and coho season also / Oct thru Dec)  this same area had always bothered any of us that walked it. several of us would talk about this moaning noise we would hear. we finally just told ourselves it had to be 2 trees rubbing against each other. Not so sure anymore!!  I have seen cougar tracks in area. 2 years before i had also witnessed a deer running for it's life down stream in the same section while doing survey. it scared me so bad cause it ran right past me. ,"one other person. He walked the stream and came upon the dead deer, i was waiting and heard all the noise. ",just heard people talk about noises etc. in the North river area.

53039,3795,30051,2004,Summer,August,WA,Klickitat County,Deleted by investigator at witnesses request,"Trout Lake, WA",The main forest road that goes out of town to the west of TL- can't remember route #- Peterson Prairie Campground is on it,"This is a compilation of experiences over a period of years in the same area (1988- 2009) - feeling of being watched, wildlife silenced, tree breaks, strong smell once, numerous late night vocalizations, rock knocking, things being thrown near our tent and an actual daytime sighting. Some of the things I mention here I didn't know were typical when I was experiencing them, but now do, since I've read other sightings on BFRO's and other sites.  My husband and I have been camping and caving in the Trout Lake, WA area for about 20 years and are both very experienced in the outdoors, particularly in the Northwest. We've gone primarily to this area for caving for many years.  The first encounter with something unusual was in 1988-89 on a caving trip in this area as we penetrated the forest, heading toward Mt. Adams through some old clearcut to visit a familiar cave. Birdsong of various types is always present, but as we made our way toward the tree line, the birdsong and even insect noise seemed to cease. I looked up, no indication of foul weather or damp wind, indicating rain. Our group ( I think 7 or 8 of us) was familiar with the deep woods and a couple people noted that this was strange. For some reason, we all stopped in our tracks, even though no one had heard anything; everyone was looking around at each other and listening. Something seemed wrong. Then, I had a very strong sense of being watched from further in, not too far away, but did not tell anyone else. I have a feeling the others sensed this as well, and we all pushed quickly on to get to the cave, sticking close to one another. This happened on several caving trips over the years, but not in the same location; the proxmity, however, was fairly close- all within about a 5 mile radius.  Another time, around 2002, my partner and I were dispersed camping alone, right next to a very seldom-used forest road in the same area, east of the main forest road. We got out of our vehicle to begin setting up camp as we had done several other times in this area and noticed an almost vomit-inducing stench. It was not the smell of something dead, it was like a combination of sun-baked garbage and feces. We decided that perhaps some local had driven back here and dumped their garbage, but then about 5 minutes later, the smell just went away?? I had no idea about the smells encountered by others at this time, so I blew it off. We walked, sniffing around the area a little and there was nothing, so we decided to camp there anyway, thinking that something must've just been carried on the wind, but it was still strange as to how strong it was.  We've also heard some late night sounds when camped at Peterson Prairie many times. Some dismissed them as coyotes. These sounds were like whoops, with several animals at once. I remember silently filing through the animal sounds that I'd heard in the wild: (elk, coyote, deer, cougar, wolf, owls, marmots, bear, human) in my mind and came up blank. Nothing matched. Still we tried to dismiss them as coyotes and went to bed. But it was like something was making the initial sound and the coyotes were answering.  But then later in 2003, another type of sound in this area made my blood turn to ice water. It was August, about 11:30 at night at Peterson, as we wanted the ""luxury"" of camping at a site, instead of dispersed, where there was running water and outhouses. We were dousing the fire and about to head into the tent when from the north, about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile, it seemed, there began a howl. Not a wolf or coyote howl, but it almost reminded me of those emergency sirens you hear in rural towns. The pitch was quite low and then it raised to a higher tone and was held there for about 6-10 seconds, but was still low in tone. I thought about Pavarotti and some very skilled baritones that I'd heard in concert. I came to a sickeningly horrifying conclusion that in all the years of voice I'd studied and heard, not one human had ever uttered something at this tone, nor could they do it at this volume. The lungs of whatever was doing this had to be absolutely huge, and as in the forest, it echoed a lot, but it was *not* echoes that made it sound strange.   I looked at my husband, who was also startled and looking at me, and then we looked at some of the other campers across the scrub from us. They had stood up and were motionless, looking back at us, then looking in the direction it was coming from. I asked, ""What IS that?"" to my husband, who said he didn't know. We remained standing and it continued for about 2 minutes, then ceased. In all the years we have camped and caved in that area, (or anywhere, for that matter) we had never heard anything like that. No human lungs were capable of that power.  I have pretty much always been a die-hard tenter/backpacker, but that night I couldn't sleep in the tent. I was too frightened with the realization that what I had just heard was impossible- impossible! No creature existed that could make that sound-- unless-- no way-- NO WAY! Then I remembered that this area had quite a few sightings of Bigfoot over the years. I just could not accept it, but I also could not sleep in the tent, so we got our bags and pads and slept in our truck that night. I barely slept, and was very glad to be leaving in the morning! I was shaken for quite a while. We went to the Mt. Adams ranger station in town that morning on the way out and asked if there were any reports of ""unusual animal activity"" the night before. The ranger looked at me like I was under the influence. I never said the words, but I knew she was thinking it. She said she had not heard of any, and by the way, just what was it that I thought I heard? I never answered.  Well, terror and curiosity sometimes go hand in hand-- we decided to go back to the area in 2004.  We camped at Peterson, as there was no freaking way I was going to camp dispersed, just the two of us, in that area now. So we're there, visiting our favorite caves in the area and early the last afternoon, my husband and I decide to go cave hunting. (What was I thinking? But it was broad daylight, so...) We trekked down a side forest road that was so overgrown with vine maple and had large tree fall at the beginning so that you couldn't drive it anymore. We bush-whacked through the grown-up vine maple in the remnants of a clearcut and split up and had planned on coming around to meet each other, as we knew this particular forest road curved around a bit.  I'd had enough bush-whacking after a while and decided to just meander down the forest road on some more even terrain. So I headed toward the mountain on this road with my husband off in the deep bush to my left. I noticed how warm it was and it was quite still- it was an uncomfortably hot day. Nothing but the sound of my boots crunching on the packed gravel. Then I heard the gravel move behind me, probably about 20 yards. I took my time turning around, thinking that it was a probably a cow, because this was an open range area, and as weird as it seems seeing cows in the forest and clearcut, this was not uncommon at all. It had sounded heavy.  Then I felt faint, like I was going blind & seeing colors and shot up with some halucinogen all at once- I watched as a HUGE, hair-covered, dark cinnamon-colored human-like thing cleared the ditch in one stride, glided into the tree line in one more lightning step and then stood absolutely still.   There I was, by myself, in the middle of this isolated forest road with a hairy (it seemed almost like semi-glossy fur?) cinnamon-colored shoulder and arm unhidden by the tree it was behind. The shoulder was absolutely massive, as was the arm, which was so long, it was almost as tall as I am. If I look, for example, at the door jamb in my office here, I'd put the shoulder's height at just under the bottom of the jamb. I could see the contour of muscles under the hair/fur. It was obviously very strong. The hair/fur appeared to be about 2-3 inches long. I couldn't see the full hand as it was blocked by some undergrowth. And there it was, standing stock still, watching me- did it think it was fully hidden?   I've heard about people being paralyzed with fear and could never imagine that, but that's exactly what was going on. I thought I was going to die very soon. I just really had no idea what was going to happen. I was completely defenseless. I wanted to move, but couldn't, I was frozen. I thought it might chase me if I ran. I could not turn my back on it. Survival mode must've kicked in somehow, because I remembered my training about bears. I began to back away very slowly and spoke very quietly and was even tempted to leave my pack for it. It still didn't move, and just stayed there, still as stone. I must've backed down that gravel about 100 yards and since there was no movement still, I decided to risk it and yell for my partner- there was no other way out of there.  I yelled for help at the top of my lungs and he answered, ""Where are you??!!"" I somewhat meekly called, ""Here.."", afraid then that my additional shouting might have the opposite effect of what I wanted and agitate the creature. A few minutes later my husband came crashing through the underbrush, a look of panic on his face. He asked what was wrong and I told him a bear- he looked disgusted and was angry. He asked where and I pointed and it was gone. He asked if it had exhibited agressive behavior. I said no, but he looked worried and started to look around and we headed away from the area. We cut through the vine maple in the opposite direction of my encounter and hightailed it back to the car. As I thought about it afterward, I noted that there was no smell during this encounter to warn me, but there was also no wind that afternoon and it was very warm.  It took me 4 years to even tell my husband what I saw. Fortunately, he's a pretty reasonable person and believes (with astonishment) what I've told him. Recently we've listened to recordings on the web of what people think are Bigfoot, and some of them sound just like what we've both heard in the area. The combination of smells, feelings & those sounds never fully registered as being connected until we found some Bigfoot sites on the web. We realized that we've experienced alot of different things in the area that were likely a Sasquatch nearby over the years.  In 2009, we camped in Peterson Prairie again, in August. I had alot of reservations about camping in a tent there due to my previous encounter in the area, but I thought with all the other campers around (6-7 sites occupied), (and right next to the obnoxious camp host RV) there wouldn't be a chance. It was raining, which was unusual for that time of year. We pulled into the campground in the evening and set up the tent in the site just north of the camp hosts. We made dinner and called it a night, with it still raining.  Something woke me at about 2:30am. It was what sounded like two rocks being knocked together, south of us, down the mostly dry creekbed. I was listening for sounds of clothing, car or camper doors, or soft voices, thinking someone was up really late. After listening intently for about 5 minutes through the sounds of light rain on the tent walls, there were no sounds of ""human"" movement nearby.   Then the rock knocking again. Just a couple times. I wanted to wake my husband to have him hear, but the sleeping bags make so much noise and I couldn't be sure he'd be silent when waking, (I also didn't want to risk becoming an item of interest to the rock knocker.) I was then shocked and terririfed by what I heard next. Something ""whooshed"" nearby and then I heard a thud on the ground. I was astonished. What can possibly be moving so fast through the air that it would make a loud whooshing sound? I listened for any sound of leaf noise in case a tree limb had fallen, but no undergrowth impact noise nor leaf noise, as I've heard before, when a limb falls.  What could possibly be whooshing so strongly through the air that I hear it and then I hear an impact nearby? Something was being thrown or beaten on the ground. Based on our experience in the area, I was pretty sure it was rocks or pieces of wood. But how freaking big (and close) did it have to be so I could hear the ""whoosh""? That was terrifying. I was literally afraid for our lives, if one of whatever it was hit the tent. I listened for footfalls or scrub noise to see if I could tell if something was coming closer. No foot falls, but another whoosh/thud. I was out of my mind with fear, thinking we'd be hurt or killed by an impact through the tent. How is it that I didn't hear something close by, either breathing or moving? It must have been from quite a distance.   I didn't sleep the entire night. My husband woke up around dawn and I was still wide-eyed in my bag. He asked me how long I'd been awake and I told him the entire night. I then told him what I'd heard and he'd wished I'd woken him up, as he believes me about my encounter and actually wants to see/hear one. I told him that I didn't want to risk becoming even more of a target by making noise during the night, so I remained still.  We now have a micro camper that we're going to start using to camp/boondock with, as we're both getting older, so a trip down to Skamania/Klickitat County is soon on the books. I'll feel a little safer in it, but you never know how interesting it might look to a night time visitor- I hope not too much so. A parabolic mike and some night vision binoculars might come with us, too. Fear and curiosity-yikes.","I was just astonished that it was so quick and quiet for being huge! I never would have known it was behind me unless the rock had moved on the road. Turns my blood to ice water, just thinking about it.","My husband was many yards away to the west, in the vine maple.","Well, yes. I read about other cavers who also camped at Peterson Prairie and heard some sounds.

We arrived around 4:00 p.m. at the Salmon Meadows campsite. We checked out serveral sites and picked the one nearest the meadows, we were the only ones at this campsite. We went for a hike and got back to the campsite. There were numerous range cattle in our area. After hanging out at our site we heard a strange howl yell down in the creek bed the sound repeated 2 or 3 times, we were about 40 feet above the creek bed, we went down to take a look, we thought that an animal had injured itself. We found a young cow on the other side of the cattle guard. We opened the barb wire fence and tried to herd it to the other side, but it wouldn't go. We put the fence back up and went back to our camp. That night I woke up many times, thought I heard something and tried to see if anything was there in the full moon light illuminated meadows and forests. Our dog didn't react so I fell back to sleep hoping for morning. We woke up to some howls down in the creek bed below us. We had a video camera and tried to catch some of the howls on tape. We got 5 clips with the howls as they moved further away. I will email the best one after I submit this report. We tried to follow the sound away from us but it moved too fast, and our son was still sleeping in our campervan. We went back to camp and didn't hear or see anything else. We went to a bakery in Okanogan, WA and told of our experience and explained where we camped and all three people working said they had heard of this kind of activity around where we were.

53077,3821,30526,2011,Summer,August,WA,Yakima County,Cowiche Wilderness - I'd rather not say exactly where - I like this area and want to keep the traffic down during hunting seasons.,Tampico,Ahtanum,"Early one morning while scouting for mule deer and elk, I had also been hoping to fill my bear tag at the same time, as bear season was open. This area is not well known for black bear activity - but they are present. I was tipped off by a neighboring camper a few nights earlier, of a watering hole in a clearing a few hundred yards from camp and assure I would see plenty of elk and mulies. I was looking forward to snapping some pics with my new camera as well as having a shot at a black bear.  I woke up well before the sun, gathered all my camera gear, rifle, pistol, and chair and headed out. Just inside the clearing, there is a grove of trees providing perfect cover for an 80 yd shot at the watering hole. Just beyond the watering hole (approx. 30 yds further) is the other side of the opening where the forest begins, and a massive game trail - like grand central station for the critters. I hunkered down and was immediately attacked by mosquitoes - like flies on sh*t. I couldn't let the constant squeeter slapping blow my cover so I cut two holes in my stocking cap, pulled it over my eyes and zipped my coat up over my neck. This helped, and I did not move a muscle for the next 30 minutes. Facing east, I was staring straight at the game trail entrance as the sun had just started coming up beyond the trees.  Then, out of nowhere - just to the left of where I was patiently watching - it moved into view. According to google earth it was 110 yds away and all it did was stand there, full-frontal and facing me. ""I'm looking at bigfoot. I'm looking at bigfoot."" - must have repeated a thousand times in my head.   As I mentioned earlier, the sun was just coming up, and it glimmered off its fur perfectly in the dark woods. I could see its full outline from the elbows up, as it was standing behind a fallen tree that was still hanging on to its roots a few feet off the ground. There was enough light that I could barely make out the shadow of its jaw line and chin - well below its shoulder line. And the hair - its hair was beaming with light from behind. I could not tell what color it was for sure, with such a contrast of color between dark woods and brilliant sunlight beaming off it, but I will forever remember the outline of its body and long hair.  So many things ran through my head, during the (approx.) 45 second encounter - with a camera on my left, and two firearms on my right - I could not gamble making a move for my camera, and I have NO reason to shoot a squatch. There was no threat, and through all the racing thoughts I came to the conclusion that this may be the last encounter I ever have. I soaked in every second. Though I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt what I was looking at, I waited to see if it was just a reflection of trees and shadows moving with the rising sun - but as soon as this thought had come to mind, the creature moved like a ghost behind a large tree and out of view.   I waited a couple hours longer, and two mule deer bucks came running from the north and stopped at the watering hole - between me and the edge of the trees where I had seen the squatch. Still eager to get a photo of the deer, I stood up to get their attention and snapped a few pics of them both looking at me. I got a few nice pictures before they took off towards the area I saw the squatch. Just before before they reached the treeline, they stopped dead in their tracks, sniffed the air, looked at me, stomped their feet, sniffed the air again, and looked back in my direction, before cautiously entering the woods and out of sight.   At this time, I grabbed just my pistol and camera and proceeded across the opening to the area of the sighting to gauge the height of the fallen tree from which behind I saw the squatch. I am 5'10"", and when I stood behind the fallen tree, the top of it came to my shoulders. This is the height at which I saw the squatch from its elbows up. With my camera in hand, and my pistol holstered, I did not feel any threat - but I really didn't want to stick around much longer either. I searched briefly for footprints, but there was so much grass, weeds, and pine needles I just assumed it was better to head back to camp and reflect.   I am looking forward to another opportunity to observe.",No other game didn't show up for a couple hours after the incident. ,No other witnesses known. Neighboring camper did however place a trail cam in that area and I will be contacting that person via email.,"One week earlier my friend and I both heard howl/screams triangulated around our campsite before bed, in the same place. 2 males and 1 female (squatches).

53061,3833,30670,2009,Summer,July,WA,Snohomish County,,Bothell/Woodinville,228th,"I grew up in a very outdoor environment and spent a substantial amount of my time growing up in and around woods, day or night. Ive lived in WA my whole life and had in interest in crypto-zoology as a child but had never taken any mention of Bigfoot seriously until I had my encounter.  I was living at my parents house that summer (2009), and spent many days visiting a friend who lived about 10min away on foot on a trail. He lived off of 228th St SE and about a block up the hill from 57th Ave, and I lived a little off of 224th St SE and 45th Ave. I could make my way to his house on this trail through a lot of heavily wooded land. If I started from the end of my driveway id take a left onto 45th Ave, and continue past 224th St down a driveway to a culdesac off of the main road. This went down a relatively steep hill, then turned left up a steep hill and leveled out at the tree line, which was where the entrance to the trail was. Winding my way up and downhill through the woods, Id pop out most the way down 53rd Ave, N of its intersection with 228th St. Id then take a right to walk down 53rd Ave, take a left onto 228th St and walk downhill until I was at my friends place. It was obviously used because the brush underfoot was consistently stamped flat, but in all my time living in that area the only people I ever saw on it were myself and any friends who mightve taken the trip with me (maps.google.com, type in 50th Ave and 228th St SE)  Having spent that night, like many before and after, relaxing on my friends patio with several other regulars, I got up, put out my cigarette, said my goodbyes and left. I walked out his driveway, took a left onto 228th, and walked towards 53rd. The night was moonless and so it was very dark; there were streetlights, but each of them was separated by 70-100ft or more and was only on one side of the road. It was probably around 1 in the morning, and it was normal for me to not see any cars on my short trip on the main road. Taking a right onto 53rd and then a left onto the trail most the way down it, I entered the trail. It was very, very still but the normal sounds were there for night time; some insects, the occasional rustle in the bushes of a smaller animal, nothing out of the ordinary. It was almost pitch black because of the tree cover, but I knew the trail like the back of my hand and walked confidently forward. Then it happened.  Behind me to my right, probably about 20ft away, I heard movement in the brush and ferns. I didnt even realizing I was hearing anything until it lasted more than a few secondsand I realized it was moving in the same direction as me and breaking sizable tree branches underfoot. I stopped and listened. In a moment, the rustling came to a stop. I could hear faint, slow, deep breathing, like that of a large animal; it wasnt loud enough to be from exertion, but seemed natural, as if whatever was behind the lung capacity was big enough to encompass several of my breaths in one of its own. I waited for about a minute and didnt hear anything except the breathing, slow and even. I took another step and started down the trail again. And again, something moved through the woods after me, keeping pace and tempo with my movements. Sure enough I could hear ferns, ivy, blackberry bushes and the like being pulled or pushed aside, and that slow breathing started again. I stopped again, and this went on for another 5 or so minutes before I reached the trailhead, scared out of my wits. I still hadnt heard any individual footsteps, hadnt seen it or smelled anything; I dont remember which way the wind was blowing, if there was one. Id decided that once I hit the tree line, Id make a run for it. So as I walked evenly up, followed in the same way I had been for several previous minutes, and trusting my years as a track runner (which I was fairly talented at), came to a stop and then bolted into a sprint down the hill.  At moment later whatever was following me decided to move as well. As I pounded down the hill towards the right turn up 45th Ave, it too broke the trees from where I had, the gravel and then the asphalt. Its breathing became a series of low growls, almost a series of calls that sounded hoarse and aggressive. It was loud; loud enough to echo off the surrounding trees. But the moment it hit the gravel I knew something was wrong; of all the animals Ive ever seen in their natural habitat that are native to western WA, none of them sounded like this one did. There was no lope, stride, or gallop that resembled how this thing sounded when it moved. One of the more intense memories of this incident was hearing that noise; distinctive impacts with the ground on not four, but two feet, and the smacking of bare feet on asphalt when it hit the driveway. That was quite unsettling, to say the least.  But then another thing happened to my dismay and confusion; instead of following me down the driveway on the asphalt, it crossed back onto the asphalt and then into the woods to my right diagonally away from me. My first sensation was relief, until I realized it had increased its speed drastically, and its calls rang out from the woods in my direction still. Rounding the corner to go up 45th to get to the street level (and where there were streetlights), I realized it was trying to cut me off by getting ahead of me by cutting through the back yards of my neighbors across the street from me. Realizing this, I got a huge adrenaline rush as I absorbed the severity of having this thing, whatever it was, between my house and I. Running as fast as I could, I cleared the hill and started running on the flat towards my driveway off the road a little farther down.  At the same time, behind me to my right, I heard this thing pound across a neighbors grass yard; heavy, distinct, single impacts of a two-legged animal. Id been able to beat it to the road, but I wasnt out of trouble yet. As I raced along the road it crossed their yard, leapt the 10ft ditch and landed 4 feet below on the asphalt road behind me all without stopping, tripping or stumbling once. It had kept on growling/calling at me, and guessing from the time it took for it to reach the road from their backyard I figure this thing couldnt have been moving any slower than 20-25MPH; and Ive been clocked at sprinting 22MPH before (not including adrenaline). As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground. As I took a turn onto my driveway, my dog Gus, a purebred Airedale Terrier, started going off barking.  I skidded around the corner, short (not including adrenaline). As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground. As I took a turn onto my driveway, my dog Gus, a purebred Airedale Terrier, started going off barking. I skidded around the corner, shortly followed by my pursuer, and got to my house with Gus running up to meet me. He was in full sprint; legs outstretched, heckles up, growling fiercely (and he was a gentle giant, he only acted that way towards squirrels/coyotes/raccoons).  He mustve seen what was after me and it stopped him dead in his tracks; he went from a sprint to 0 in about 3-5ft and started barking extravagantly. I stopped as I heard whatever this creature was stop and wheeled around to look back for the 1st time. Away from the streetlights on a moonless night with old pine/fir trees looming overhead, my eyes couldnt see a damn thing. But I did see the gravel it mustve kicked up by coming to such a fast halt land near my feet and felt it bonce off my shoes and lower legs as I was turning around. The three of us were all frozen in place for a single, quiet moment. Gus was growling, hair raised, ready to defend me. I was panting, standing straight and looking straight into the darkness. And whatever this creature was couldnt have been more than 15ft in front of me, growling and breathing deeply enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck again even after being chased the way I was. Gus and I looked at each other at the same time and I said stay with all the gravity I could muster in my voice. He looked back into the darkness and continued growling as I dashed the garage, grabbed a hatchet and ran back. I returned to the same scene; Gus and this thing having a growl-off. I unsheathed the hatchet and stood ready, waiting, searching the blackness or any sign of this thing. But all I could hear was its breathing and the intense sensation that we were making eye contact; that this thing and I were holding each other with our eyes for several minutes. Then suddenly I heard crashing and rustling in the bushes moving away from me for a good 30 seconds, and Gus relaxed.  We both went inside and I didnt let him out at night for a week after that; after dark hed sit by the windows and occasionally growl as if hed seen something. He didnt even do that to any of the other animals hed normally go Terrier on. And each time he did Id step outside and listen, and the woods would be filled with an unnatural quietness, or stillness.  Since that night I can confidently say that I was stalked, followed, and then chased by a Bigfoot, that then was dissuaded by the presence of my dog and the light of the house so near. ",For several weeks (before and after this event) several of the friends who's house I'd been at and I had all heard strange movement in the woods just outside of the light at night circling his house.,My dog (upon my arrival home),I had a childhood friend who told me that within a mile of my parent's house was a teepee he'd found (when he was a kid) in the woods made of different kinds of tree branches and surrounded by scattered animal bones.

I will explain my story and let you decide. Thank you.  September 23, 2011, Myself and a group of friends decided to go camping late one night near the, White River. We took about a 40min walk to get to our campsite.(it was a little after 11pm.) 5min after we arrived, we heard an Elk Mating call from across the river and thought it was pretty cool, didn't think much of it. About 30min in, after we get the fire going, we heard another unexplainable ""yelp"" sound that echoed off. It was only one time, from a distance, possibly 1/2 of a mile or less out. We all looked at each other as if one of us could explain what it was but we couldn't and again, didn't think much of it.  About a few hours later after roasting marshmellows and havin a good time, we decide it's time to hit the hay, one guy, the only one of us who drank too much, was already passed out. (There was 4 of us!) My best friend and I crawled into the tent and the 4th guy decided to stay outside for a little longer. After 2min or so he called out to us, ""I keep hearing something over by the river, like it's really close to us."" He then grabbed the cheap flashlight from our tent and pointed it in the direction he heard the sound and then, ""Oh my god, I see something by the river, I can't make it out but it looks big.""   (we've camped at this location before and nothing unusual has ever happened.)  Now, I aint dumb, I felt like he was just trying to scare us becuz he likes to do that when we're out camping and he has before but he's never made any pranks like this, he looked pretty white in the face, eyes where all wide like he was really scared. After he was done observing, he climbed into the tent with us and decided to call it a night but every so often he'd peek his head out to check and kept talkin about what he saw. It was scaring me a little.  2-3 hours probably passed and both 2 guys where out cold, me and my best friend were still awake, we were too shook up about what he saw. Then out of no-where, we heard this LOUD KNOCK on a tree, right next to our campsite, close to were our fire was. Scared the living hell out of us. We kept very quite and still, didn't speak a word! After a long while passed we didn't hear anything unusual and my friend was drifting off to sleep. I was too scared. I think I stayed up for another hour and that's when I got the living daylights scared outta me!   Just outside our tent, I could hear something walking closer to us, like something with 2 feet. Sticks were cracking and I could hear lite footsteps on the ground. Like it was trying to be quite not to wake us. I heard it brush the tent a little. I was paralized with fear. My best friend was laying next to me. I woke her up, going insane with the noise. I didn't speak a word to her, just looked at her and feeling fear and she knew something was wrong. Within 10 seconds after waking her, the crunching of the sticks started again and the lite footsteps followed. We woke up the guy who complained of seeing something. He peeked his head outside the tent and saw nothing, (it was also very dark, you wouldn't of been able to make out things 4 feet from you.) About 10min later, we all layed quite and remained a alert. Then, the snapping of sticks came back but it started going away from us until eventually, we didn't hear it anymore.  When dawn approched I finally felt safe to sleep, We woke around 11am and i started to investigate. I looked around the tent and on the ground. Didn't see anything unusual, no footprints, I didn't really have a lot of time to investigate becuz everyone wanted to leave. I also wanted to try and mimic the crunching sound I heard, (I'm not very good at analizing things either, broken sticks would seem natural to me.) I walked out toward the river bank were our guy friend said he saw something, didn't see any footprints, if something was there, it would of left behind a track in the mud.   Our tent was set up over hard ground and low brush.    If you think this could of been a possible BF encounter or something else. Let me know! I don't think I'll be camping out there again.","First time we camped there, we noticed a pile of rocks that where stacked up. I later removed the rocks to help make a toilet.

53009,3855,31009,1983,Fall,September,WA,Clallam County,House right off Mt Pleasant Rd. We were in driveway of house north of mine.,Port Angeles,Mt Pleasant Rd,"Fall 1983  My four friends and I were playing Chinese jump rope in their yard late one afternoon, just before evening.  My neighbor owned somewhere around 100 acres across the street and the five acre parcel we were playing on.  He owned a herd of buffalo and for some reason had one young buffalo alone on this parcel.  As my friends and I were playing, the buffalo caught our attention as it came running across the property.  I remember we all looked up at it and wondered why it could have acted so spooked.   We went back to playing and a bit later one of my friends, the only boy, exclaimed Did you guys see that?  There was a tall black thing on two legs that just jumped across the creek.  We all looked out into the field, but did not see anything.  The rest of us told him to quite messing around, but he insisted he was serious.  We dismissed his claims and continued our game.  Since it wasnt my turn, I kept scanning the field wondering what the boy may have seen.  I noticed a black stump under a tree, which I could not recall being there before.  I kept looking at it thinking is that a stump or something else?  The shape looked like a tall black figure standing upright, leaning forward with very long arms down to its knees.  The head was turned looking directly at us.  However it was so still I thought it had to be a burnt stump.  I felt it was looking directly at me but it did not move at all.  I kept my eyes fixed on it, but turned my head to make it look like I wasnt watching it.  Immediately it began to run across the field.  It ran on two legs, had very long swinging arms and a flat face.  It was very tall and covered in black hair.    I yelled and everyone turned and started screaming.   Upon hearing our screams, it turned to look at us and immediately turned its direction and ran back up into the woods.   We were all very scared and ran into the house.   My friends dad believed us as he said he had seen a bigfoot when they had lived in Moses Lake, WA.  I was so scared I called my parents next door and wanted them to come pick me up in their car.  My family dismissed our claims, but I know there is no way it was anything else but a bigfoot. The next day we went out in the field.  We could not find any footprints, but could see where something large ran through the tall grass.  Looking under the tree where I originally saw the stump, I estimate it was 7 feet tall based on a tree limb it was just beneath.  There was a deer path where we saw it enter the woods.  When we approached the path, my friends dog started growling, so we took off.   The next school day we were riding the bus home.  I was excited to tell the other kids what we had witnessed.  Of course they all started to tease us, and the other kids which had witnessed the encounter quickly backed off our story and would never speak of it again.    I am 100% positive we saw a bigfoot that day.  No other animal could run on two legs with arms swinging the way this did.  Its face was flat, so in no way could have been a bear.  It was too big and moved differently than a human.   Based on the way it watched us, and waited until it thought we were not looking at it, I believe its an intelligent creature.  I think we have them around us a lot more than we will ever know.  I have had other experiences where I may have heard vocalizations, wood knocking and possibly have smelled it, but do not know for sure.  I also know there are a lot more people who have witnessed similar events, but never report it.  I laugh at the naive that do not believe as I know the truth. ",,"Three other girls, one boy.  We were playing in driveway.  ","Not on Mt Pleasant Rd, but others on Olympic Peninsula.  I once knew a lady who had seen a white bigfoot in Discovery Bay, Jefferson County while checking on a foaling mare one night.  My husband and I heard tree knocking while cutting fire wood up the Twin River area in 2007. In August 2011 we went camping up the Sol Duc and smelled a terrible smell one night like rotting fish.  I had our boys move into our tent with us and in the middle of the night our puppy woke me up terrified, but would not make a sound.  His whole body was shaking and he moved to the very back of the tent and kept his attention fixed forward.  The smell was gone the next day.  There was also stones stacked up down by the river which resembeled the camp ground.  I cannot be sure a person did not stack the stones though.   Since looking at your sight and listening to the vocalizations, I am sure I have heard them before, but did not know what it was.  My brother knew a girl who found a footprint I beleive in the Sol Duc a few years ago.  She did not have a camera.  ","Late afternoon, early evening.  Still day light.

53057,3857,31052,2011,Fall,November,WA,Skagit County,This was on the side of the North Cascades Highway close to Rainy Pass. I am not completely sure.,Newhalem or Mazama,On Hwy 20,"I was driving on the North Cascades Highway (HWY 20) traveling east across the pass. It was close to twilight and it was clear and cold. While close to Rainy Pass (maybe a bit before), I see something that strikes me as not normal. It is about 1/4 mile up the highway on the side of the road. At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing.  As I got closer, I see that it was clearly not a man. But just before I got a better look, it slipped down the side of the road into the ravine. And that was when I knew what I had just seen. The way it moved was sylph-like. Almost as if it shimmered away. I looked back to where it had been, and it had completely disappeared.  Now, if that isn't enough for you, there's more. About two miles further up the mountain pass, I saw another. It was a little smaller, but moved in the same graceful manner as it quickly went down the side of the mountain out of my view. The leaves on the tree that it had been next to still gently shook as I drove by.  I cannot say with any surety what these creatures looked like exactly. But they were definitely not bears - too tall and far too graceful. They were not human - too graceful and quick.  They were both dark though. If they were at all reddish, I did not notice. They both seemed to be very dark brown. The smaller one darker than the bigger one.   If I was to guess size, I would say the larger one was 6'4"" - 6'8"" and probably around 250 - 300 lean pounds. The smaller was perhaps 6'0? And around 200 lbs maybe?  The thing that was so completely out of the ordinary, was the manner in which they moved. I have never seen something so large move so fluidly.

It was after the 4th of July for sure, but I think it was August. My Parents cannot remember what month it was, but they think August as well. My family & I had been going to Holden Village every summer for several years.   The only way to Holden Village is to take the Ferry from Lake Chelan 10 miles up the lake, get off the Ferry at Lucern & take a bus up a 17 mile logging road up the mountain to an old mining town. Holden village is a Lutheran retreat now but you can go up year round. I have not been back since I sighted what I think was a ""sasquatch.""  I have NEVER reported this to anyone besides my family & the Rangers/counselors who were there that night.... My family & I had met several other families that weekend trip and a few had kids my age. There was me, my friend (11), another two girls who were 12, & one 13 yr old boy. On the last night the kids were having a round of ""hide & go seek "" in the dark around the main camp. All the adults were gathered at the main picnic table area & all us kids were running around having a good ole' time in the dark. I was determined to not have any of the kids find me, so I decided to run off a bit further...over behind the maintenance shed, by the stinky garbage cans & over by a very steep drop off. My eyes were already adjusted to the dark, even though there were several outside lights in the main area.  As I ran around the back of the maintenance shed, I stopped & heard a slight movement in the gravel on the hard ground....I stopped, looked over (10 feet away) & saw a HUGE black mass/shadow hunkered over the garbage cans, which were chained down. The huge mass stopped whatever it was doing, turned, & in one SMOOTH MOTION, turned at the waist ,& stood up right to about 8 plus feet tall. No smell, no noise,(except for the sound of crunching gravel on hard pan soil).  My first thought was, ""OMG! It's a bear!""...but because of the motion & shape I thought...""This is a MAN IN A COAT with his hood up""....I was so shocked & confused that I backed up after about 3 seconds & then turned & ran to get my parents. Whatever it was could have reached out & grabbed me easily but did not. The only way it could have gone was after me (into a well lighted area), around the back of the building (another WELL lighted area), OR straight down a VERY steep shale cliff side down towards a river.   When I found my folks & told them ""I saw a bear-man,"" they freaked out & got a camp ranger & reported that either a weirdo or a bear was behind one of the buildings ....I was told it was a BEAR, so ,of course, I believed it was the biggest bear in the whole world for years!  There is more to the story, but I just wanted to let you guys know that maybe you might want to check out the Lake Chelan area! I have checked  to see if there have been any more reports...there have been a few.   I know what I saw & my son has encouraged me to report this after all these years. I would be willing to take a lie detector test & my parents remember this whole thing as well. Many thanks, Really glad to get this off my chest!

53053,3921,32536,2005,Fall,November,WA,Pierce County,It is mostly deserted in the fall because of cold and is an isolated location on secluded hillside with non friendly vehicle road.very dark at night and lots of animals and fish in lake! ,greenwater Wa.,Off of fs70off of hwy410 (precise location edited to protect the site),I am from Cle Elum Wa. and I am reporting an encounter with an unknown creature that I was sure was not a bear or animal such as that nature. This incidence took place over a two day period in the forested area of Wa. near green water area off of FS road 70 at a lake in the Greenwater Wa. area off of hwy 410.   My husband and I camped at this lake every Thanksgiving weekend from 2002-2005 and on our last holiday 4 day weekend that we were there we experienced something of an encounter with what I believe to be a bigfoot. It was a Saturday morning when this started and it started with huge ear shattering deep growling howl like screams....more like warnings from something that did not want us there. We were the only human occupants in that area since it is very cold and most people are enjoying their weekend watching football and stuff at home. this lake is very isolated and a trek to get into since the road is overgrown with bushes and hard on vehicle paint jobs. We were cooking breakfast when this screaming at us started and it was such an unusual sound that it made my hair stand up and made me afraid to go into the woods to use the bathroom. There were many of these gutteral warning screams and they were watching us and I know this for fact since I was being brave and going to go down towards the lake and it scream growled at me and the force was so intense that the vibration from the sound literally knocked me back a step!I did not go down to the lake since I knew this noise was a warning! It was warning us to stay away from certain parts of the area that we were camping at. that night as we lay sleeping in our tent trailer there was a wind storm and I was waken by the sounds of our cooking gear being clanged like it was being kicked and thrown about. I was scared out of my wits when I heard what sounded like a load of logs being dumped beside the tent trailer. I woke my husband and was yelling at him to get up and lets just leave and come back in the morning and pack up and go. He said no and we stayed the night and when I got up the next morning and went outside all of our cooking stuff was all back where it had been except for some items that had been misplaced but not by the wind.  I can not explain why I heard the metal pans clanging in the night like they were bing banged together and I was thinking from the wind storm our stuff would be everywhere but it wasn't. The screaming growls started again that Sunday morning as we were moving about camp and fixin breakfast. My husband asked if I could smell a stench and I said no since I have allergies and he proceeded to go into the woods behind our camp to do his business when this thing let out a long screamgrowl and it was enough to turn my husband around and back o camp. My husband has grown up in this area and has hunted the area for many years and he said he has never heard anything like this before. My husband does not spook easily however this made him think twice. We camped there many times and have had several experiences with this wood clapping ad whistling your research suggests. Every time we go there we feel we are being watched and hear the wood claps and I have even heard heavy breathing from something eating some hot links that I thrown down the hill from camp. This is a very squatchy area and should not be overlooked since I can recall the wood claps and some whistles and even some calling in the distance not done by us and it was at dusk when we heard the calling across the way.This thing watched us for two days and scream-growled at us both that Saturday and Sunday. We packed up and left on Sunday. ,"smell, sound, feeling of being watched  and wood claps. for some reason I felt this one was protecting a younger one and that's why it was so serious about keeping us away from certain part of the area!

Had a camera (Astak Mole) out on my back porch to capture animals in my yard (for fun in the summer - we see Deer frequently and Bear occasionally). I was laying in bed listening to the audio through the camera (it has a pretty sensitive mic) and heard some odd ""wooping"" in the distance. Luckily a moth or something set the camera off and it recorded two of them. I think I heard about 4 total - two are on the video file I have and will mail it to you. They sound like they're loud but distant (resonates off the hills a bit it sounds like). This was Aug. 27, 2011 at 11:41 PM.  Sunday morning, January 22, 2012 got up and looked out my bedroom window to look at the snow (we had almost 2 feet total but it had been raining for days so it was dwindling).  The tracks were starting to really show up as the snow melted - noticed my ATV tracks through the back yard from Monday or so, several sets of footprints from my son and dog, then an odd ""dotted line"" set in between all of them.  Took a picture from my window, went to church, then came back and took more close up shots and measured the distance between the ""steps"" which were between 5 and 6 feet consistently.  They were in a straight line going from one tree in the back of my yard directly to a large tree in the middle of the yard (not around it, but directly to it which I thought was weird) then a set of prints turn right and head to another tree at my property line with my neighbor to the East and don't know where from there.  I also couldn't track the steps out the back of the property - the snow was melted a lot more and there was no obvious direction.  There's a private dirt road behind my property and on the other side of that, acres of trees.    On January 27, wondering if this is some frequent path I set up a trail cam on the path and captured what sounds to me like walking up to the camera (the IR's didn't fire due to low battery I think) but the picture's black - but you can take a listen and see what you think...not conclusive, but interesting I think anyway.  Got some fresh batteries out there now.",Nothing of interest,"Wife, son saw the tracks...took pictures.",Only sound recordings of woops in August...and the footsteps from 1/27 which may or may not be anything...sounds like a person but there were no people out there.,Not sure - snowed sometime during the previous week before 1/22.,Open area between trees.,22
53053,3933,32824,1986,Fall,September,WA,Pierce County,,"Dupont and Fort Lewis, Wa","Flora Rd, Plank Rd","I was working as a Military Police law enforcement command soldier at Fort Lewis, Washington from November 1985 to December 1986. My barracks were on North Fort Lewis. We commonly drove from the main post provost marshal office via the Pendleton Road route into north fort. In the early fall of 1986, I was travelling this route as I had many times before in the company of my partner and friend, also an M.P., who is from Oregon. We had often spoken and joked about various legends we had heard about Sasquatch inhabiting or existing in the Pacific Northwest, and being from Ohio, I was a thorough non-believer. We were travelling northwest along Flora Rd on north Fort Lewis between the Fort Lewis Museum and 41st Division Drive, approximately ¾ mile from San Francisco Ave, at twilight, when we observed a large fur covered animal cross the road from left (w) to right (e) in approximately four (4 ) steps. It was walking upright, had a long lumbering gait, long arms, a large head, and walked mildly stooped at the shoulders, and appeared to be at least 8 feet tall. We stopped the truck and flipped on the bright headlights. Initially thinking it was a bear, I slowly rolled closer, excited about seeing my first wild bear on post. We were approximately 50 to 80 yards away, at the time. The animal stopped on the right side of the roadway at the edge of the trees, turned and looked towards us, and with one step, disappeared into the trees. I remember trembling and thinking I couldnt believe my eyes. It was definitely NOT a bear! My partner and I stopped in the roadway, and got out of the truck. We saw where the pine limbs were still shaking where they had been parted by the animal, as it moved through. We could hear it walking ahead of us by about 30 or so yards, and then the walking noise stopped. We walked into the trees, towards where we last heard the sound. We both had our flashlights, but it was not yet quite dark, and were still in our camouflage uniforms. My friend was about 5 yards ahead of me, and we had gone about 30 yards into the woods, when a large limb cracked in a tree just ahead of us and there was a scream unlike anything I had ever heard. My friend turned towards me and began sprinting back towards the road, past me, yelling run, with his eyes wide open. I turned, running, to follow him and whatever the animal was, was now behind us, wailing what resembled a scream. We got back to the truck and we both noted that the other was white as a ghost. We rode back to the barracks in near silence. We both agreed that we had just witnessed and heard a bigfoot! The next day, after calming down considerably, we went back to the spot and found several high tree limbs bent and broken by something very large and very tall. The ground had a covering of both fresh green and brown pine needles, but no evidence of footprints. It has always been a running joke between us, even after all these years, that we encountered a sasquatch that evening. I have been a believer since that day. Many of our friends laughed at us when we told them, but several later admitted that they had seen something similar crossing the roads during late evening patrols around Ft Lewis, especially in the more remote training areas and roads, and near Solo Point at Puget Sound or near Sequalitchew Lake on North Fort Lewis. I will never forget that day!",,We were both riding in my truck. Two of us.,Noted above.,"It would've been apporoxmately 30-45 minutes before sundown. It was medium light (twilight),with long shadows and objects in the road were easily visible without aid of headlights. There were large pine trees on both sides of the road and the forest was mildly dense next to the road. It was dry and warm at the time this occurred.","Pine forest, at the time, this area adjacent to the road was not heavily developed,and was not heavily traveled. there was a large lake within 1/2 to 3/4 mile to the west of where this occurred, and I-5 and a security/boundary fence line was approximately 1 mile east.",15

53015,3965,33867,1981/2011,Spring,May,WA,Cowlitz County,along highway 12,first (salkum) the other two near (Packwood),Highway 12 east,"My cousin and I where fishing on the Cowlitz near (SAULKUM) next to the trout hatchery river bank and we were about forty yards from each other. I kept getting the feeling that we were being watched. I did not speak to my cousin because the noise from the river was so loud. I thought I might of heard something close to me directly behind me so I looked back only to see the trees move like something was walking through them.This area was at the bottom of a cliff with sort of a small point along the river and I was on the tip point. The trees were mostly 30 plus foot alders and thick under brush.  After seeing the trees moving I could make out something large in the brush but it was concealed just enough to block my perfect view. So as I looked at my cousin he was looking at me with a scared look on his face and motioned his head toward the area this thing was in and I pointed at the trail and motioned him to go back toward camp.The subject at this time was behind him he did not see any shape or anything he sensed something and then heard something. As he started running down the trail I joined in behind him and pulled my knife out and told him if something gets me dont stop. As we were running down the trail I looked back over my shoulder several times after say 50 to 60 yards into the trail and saw nothing then I looked again before slowing down and when I looked back there was an arm and hand reaching for me as it came out onto the trail right behind me I yelled at my cousin run its behind us dont look back just run. I looked again and it was gone. We continued back to camp and told my grandfather that i think we just got chased by a bigfoot and his response was ""are you smoking dope there is no such thing as big foot "".  I was 16 at the time and an avid sportsman hunting in the woods by myself for years always going into my area to hunt before dark with no flashlight. so this isnt a case of a scared little boy. my cousin and I went back the next day and looked around we did find tracks in the soft dirt at the bottom of the cliff face however they had no details the soft dirt filled the prints. I am a gifted tracker and have been all my life I am the one in the family that always gets called to track wounded animals or to locate animals that had been seen and lost. I am woods wise and not one to let the imagination run wild. I know what I saw that day and if the public thinks I am full of it well I know the truth.That was 30 years ago however I will never forget it nor will my cousin, it freaked him out and he did not see what I saw.   I am a fan of the show and I thank you for all the long hours spent in the field to bring this topic into the limelight.   I had two more encounters last year along the Cispus river near (Mount Adams) with my cousin. We were up in Cispus river valley near (Cat creek) and even over the water I could hear a scream twice and the snow was about one and a half feet deep on the roads and there was no sign that other people had traveled this area. My cousin did not want me to respond. Then just up the road about 3 miles on a different trip a few months later and while on a hike in a timbered area with snow about 3 feet deep as we went along an old logging road we started hearing tree knocks and other than us and a few plants as well as a few birds it was silent dead silent. The tree knocks seemed to be about 30 to 40 yards on our right in thick brush only to hear a response tree knock on our left and ahead of us about 60 to 80 yards. then we stood there and I asked them if they wanted me to respond to the knocks with more knocks or a call and they both asked if I please would not respond and they wanted to leave. I took them back to camp and let it go. I did make a hike later by myself to look for tracks and to try to get a response to tree knocks. Well no response to the knocks and the snow was disturbed by something large but again no visible detail the snow was powdery and lots more had fallen by the time I returned. I was also carrying my video and still camera when I came back but like I said nothing there where no other vehicle or human tracks in the area. I will be returning to the area this year as I do every year but this year I will be on a mission to look for more evidence and I will be calling and tree knocking because I will be alone this time so no limits this time.  Thank you (Name removed by investigator)",see above,1 the first time the second time 2,yes years ago,the first time was in the evening about two hours before dark the next was about 11 pm and the last was early morning,river valley and mountains,15
53073,3968,33908,1995,Summer,July,WA,Whatcom County,"South Pass Road just after crossing breckenridge creek bridge and the road climbs up and to the right, at the end of the guardrails to the right, North Pass Road is off to your left just ahead. ","Everson, WA",South Pass Road just before North Pass heading East,"I was driving home with my baby girl late after visiting her grandma one July night, I think it was the 4th of July weekend. I was coming up on a corner with a guardrail to my right, there is a gully with a creek at the bottom, and a telephone pole about 3 feet from the end of that, I was going 35 mph. When I was almost arond this corner my lights started hitting something that I thought was a telephone pole or a guardrail at first but I knew that it was something crouched down on the last cement guardrail post as I got closer. When I got closer the thing stood up from almost sitting on it's heels and jumped into the middle of my lane and threw it's hands up in the air, I'm thinking about 8' total from a crouching position, I think trying to make itself look bigger. I think it was only around 7 feet tall, it didn't seem that much bigger than my stepdad and brothers who are 6'2""-6'4"". I was so shocked, I could not believe what I was looking at, totally stunned. It was all black and definately not a bear, I've seen a black bear and it was definately not that. It's arms stretched high like a man's not like a bear and I didn't see a longer nose like a black bear has, it was like a man not a dog's face. I think as soon as it realized I wasn't stopping it laid down on the road right in front of me and I ran over it with my little Honda Civic sedan. My drivers side tires went over its head and it was a very loud boom boom as I rode over it with all four tires. I immediately started thinking about stopping and seeing if it was still alive but all I could think is that if I got out it might come after me and then my daughter woudln't have me anymore. I thought what if it did damage to my car and I got stuck out there with it and my baby. I cried the whole way home thinking I had just killed the only Bigfoot there was, and still there is no doubt that's what I saw. When I got home my family had left a note saying that they had gone up to Canada to go to a wave pool and there was no way to get a hold of them so I thought about what I should do for about half an hour or so. I put my daughter in bed right away. I decided to call 911 and tell them that I had hit a bear and I was worried that it was injured and would go after some of the young children who lived down a private driveway just across from where I hit it. I said I was also worried that it might cause an accident because it was in the road if it was dead. I wanted them to find it on the road, I wanted someone to discover it so I wouldn't seem crazy. As soon as I got off the phone with 911 I went out to the car to see what the damage was to my car. Amazingly I only noticed one thing, my license plate holder with the dealership's name was broken in half and the bottom half was gone and the whole license plate was bent under the car. I bent it back and noticed some hair hanging from the license plate bolt. My dogs were circling and circling the car and wouldn't leave it alone. I grabbed the hair and thought maybe it would help if I got the hair off the car. I was thinking the whole time I was throwing the hair into our garbage that I should maybe keep it but decided against it because I figured that no one would believe me anyways, my lab mix's hair was very similar in color, DNA testing was announced on the news only months later, can you imagine how mad I was that I didn't keep it. It was dark brown with sort of reddish highlights to it. It was wirey feeling. When my family got home they did not believe me, my brothers to this day still tease me a little about it. I thought there was only one way to prove to my brothers and parents that I wasn't crazy, call 911 and check out what had come of my call. When I called them the next day they had no record of my call, even after I told them the exact time of my phone call they couldn't find it. So I decided to take one of my brothers with me to the place where I hit it and show him the evidence on the road, surely there would be some left over from the night before. There was nothing on the road, no hair, no blood, no nothing. I just realized a couple months back there should of been one thing for sure, the other half of my license plate holder but it wasn't there. I looked everywhere but I didn't spot anything. It hadn't rained, it hadn't even been 10 hours later on a very lightly driven road, at the time. My brother thought I was insane. I've only told a few of my close friends and family over the years but only a few even think that what happened to me is possible, most of them just think I'm telling a joke. I sometimes hear the cry late at night that could only be a Bigfoot but I haven't seen one again. The only reason why I'm coming forward now is because I never knew there was any organization for this sort of thing and I want my brothers to apologize for teasing me for all these years, I won't be holding my breath though. Thanks for reading this, I appreciate it. I'm sorry my sighting was so long ago but I hope others may have seen something in this region more recently.","All evidence of my phone call that night to 911 was missing when I called to ask what had happened, my dealership license plate holder half was not on the road, neither was there any hair or blood after the accident.","No, just myself and my 3 month old baby.

53033,3985,34479,2007,Spring,March,WA,King County,"Marymoor Park is a fairly large park that used to be a farm.  It is on the edge of Lake Sammamish and is bordered by the Sammamish River on the west.  Part of the park is open grassland, some is forested by pines and flowering trees, and part of it is swampy terrain, especially along the lake edges.  There are several large brambled areas.  There are intermittant stands of brush throughout the park, a community farm, a pet cemetery, large off-leash areas, sporting grounds (cricket, baseball, soccer, tennis),an auditorium, a velodrome, and a house/museum.  The old chicken coops and barns are now facilities/maintenance offices and sheds.  The park hosts a great deal of wildlife:  rabbits, weasels, water fowl, salmon, snakes, birds of prey (owls, osprey, hawks), coyotes and deer.  There are residential areas to the west of the park.  To the east, mountains arise above the lake, and there is a great deal of wild terrain.","Redmond, WA",Hwy 520,"I was walking my dogs in Marymoor Park, near Redmond, WA.  It was in the early-to mid-afternoon. The park was predominantly empty and quiet, and despite recent rain, the paths were not overly muddy.  It was a sort of hazy day, with some sun, probably 50-60 degrees.   We had followed a somewhat under-utilized trail/road that parallels Hwy 520, going from the velodrome down to the Sammamish River.  It is a grassy area with occasional brush.  The trail makes a T-junction at the Sammamish River bank.  One can turn right and go under Hwy 520 to Redmond Town Center shopping district, or turn left and remain in Marymoor Park. Just at the bank of the Sammamish River, there is a stand of brambles that create large mounds on both sides of the trail on the Marymoor side of Hwy 520.  This little bramble forest is probably about 30 yards long.   The Sammamish River travels along the west edge of the park, emptying into Lake Sammamish about 1/4 mile away (or slightly more?), in the park.  (Salmon run this river in October/November.)  We turned left and were walking through the brambles, parallel to the Sammamish River, heading into the park and away from Hwy 520.    Just as we were at the end of the bramble mounds, and emerging into a clearing area, to my right, from the river bank, there arose a hair-raising screeching howly yowling sound, like something terrified and screaming. It did not sound human and was quite long-winded/sustained. I stopped and stood very still.  I was chilled to the bone by the sound, the hair standing up on my body.  One dog looked towards the river, his fur also standing on end and the other cowered a bit, her tail down.   The sound was coming from within about 50 yards of us, but I could not see anything or anyone along the river bank.  There is brush and trees there, so they were blocking my view of some areas of the river bank.  The W. Sammamish Parkway is across the river and parallel to the river and the trail I was on.  The cars travelling along that road create a certain roar as do the ones on Hwy 520.  Whatever this yowling sound was, it was super audible above the sound of traffic on both these busy roads.    After a minute, we began walking again, and the sound arose again.  This time, it was further away, maybe 75 yards up the river.  This time, the yowling sound was followed by knocking sounds of wood on wood.  At this point, I did go to the edge of the river and look up the river bank to see if I could catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was making the noise, but I could not see anyone or anything there.  I wondered if it was people goofing around, but I did not see anyone or hear people sounds.  A few minutes later, I heard knocking, again, but no yowling.  It was probably from the area just below an old non-functioning windmill that stands on the banks of the Sammamish River, near the west entrance & bridge into the park.  When we reached the main bridge that comes into the park from the Sammamish Parkway (close to the windmill), we turned east, towards the Clise Mansion and park facilities area, and were no longer walking along the river.  I did not hear any other yowling sounds after that.  Also, from that vantage point (the bridge), I could not see anyone or anything along the river.  About 15 minutes later, when I drove out of the park, I again stopped near the bridge to look up and down the river, but saw nothing and no one.","I had heard wood knocking when in the park on several other occasions.  I went to the park almost every day of the year, regardless of weather, and was often one of only a few people there.  Mostly, I was there in the afternoon, when the days were short, and early evening in the summer. (Summer is busy in the park.  It's rarely quiet there, in the evenings). During the cold months, in the afternoon, the park is very quiet and deer and coyotes are common sights there.  I never investigated the knocking sounds on other occasions and did not really give them much thought.",just me and my dogs,"Since this event, I have read on the BFRO website that someone heard vocalizations near Redmond.  At the time that I heard these sounds, I did not know that Bigfoot made such sounds--howling and wood knocking.  I really did not have any idea what could be making the sounds I heard, at the time I heard them.  They seemed too loud to have been made by people.",Afternoon,"The area along the Sammamish River is skirted to the west by the W. Sammamish Parkway and a residential area beyond that.  The banks of the river are grassy, but there are stands of pine, poplar, brambles, and plantings made by the original farmers of the land:  horse chestnut and flowering trees. The river hosts many birds and salmon and empties into Lake Sammamish not too far away from where this event occurred.  There is also grass/green plant life growing in the river.",15

It was about 5:40 when we came through a hay field and stopped to decide where we should go next. I was looking across the field scanning the tree line that runs along the edge of the river. At the far southwest end of the field I notice a figure getting up out of a blackberry patch. It was huge and dark. I couldnt tell how tall it was but I could tell it was massive. Big shoulders long arms and wide body all covered in brown hair. The hair on it head looked like it went to its shoulders. It stood up and walk from the center of the patch to the trail in front of it. I brought it to the attention of the others with me as it crossed the trail and stood next to a fir tree it looked back at us. It turned and walked south into the next hay field and towards the southwest corner. We ran to were we saw it. We found nothing. The blackberry bushes looked like something used it as a bed, all the branches were bent down flat. We compared the fir tree with my son T to get an idea of how tall it was, my son is 6ft and the creature was at least 8.5 we took pictures then followed the grass trail it left behind (We could see where it went across the field in bent grass) and into the second field and stopped at the edge of the third and noticed that ahead of us the birds flew out of the trees making alot of noise. a few minutes later we heard dogs barking in the distance but not to far.

53037,4005,35031,2011,Summer,June,WA,Kittitas County,,easton,I-90,"I was fly fishing by a lake in WA. I was all alone. I was setting up my camp I got bored and started singing softly. A short time later I started smelling what smelled like dirty cat litter. I thought that was really odd after a while I just ignored it. Then I started breaking the big branches to make my fire. After breaking the really big branches I heard a loud very loud knock. I thought that was odd because I was the only one around I was high up. So I thought maybe that was a bear coming down a tree or something. So after that I did some screams to try to scare it away. So I started my fire I had some meat out by the fire. After a while I started hearing whistles I was like what the heck I never heard a bird like that. Mind you Im in the mountains a lot so when that happened I started to be on my guard. I also lived in Yosemite for 9 months. After cooking one pork chop I had one still laying on the rock beside me. I started hearing rustling in the trees behind me so I grabbed my bear spray. I went to go check it out and didnt see a bear. So I went back to camp didnt think about anymore. After I was done with my dinner a big rock came crashing by almost hitting my car. I thought it was just a rock falling from a cliff. Then I started thinking about it theres no cliffs by me what the heck! So I started screaming to scare it away. I did that for a minute or two then relaxed for a bit. Then another big rock was thrown so I got really pissed off and started really yelling. Then I thought my mind is just playing tricks so I ignored it. Then maybe 20, 30 minutes later a really big rock was thrown. When that happened again I knew it wasnt my mind playing games with me. So I was thinking is this really happening? A couple of minutes passed another rock thrown. So I started to yell again then I heard a really angry loud whoop sound like I never heard before. I could feel it inside me it was that loud like you were at a concert or something. I got really scared and drove away.",I always felt like i was being watched when I go there,,,right before dawn,I was camping next to the creek,

We were shocked and do not recall the exact mile marker closest.  However, it was on a 90 degree (or close to) turn in the road.","The area that the creature entered was so thick it would be hard to enter, however, it had no problems.

53039,4035,35479,2010,Fall,September,WA,Klickitat County,This happened while I was traveling South West on the BZ Glenwood Highway 2 miles from the BZ junction on to HWY 141.,BZ Corner,BZ-Glenwood Highway,"I was on my way back from Glenwood where my cousin had had a high school volleyball game; I and her older brother had hung around town well after the game so I left around midnight. On the way back I drove slower than normal because I didn't want to hit a deer with my car I had bought the previous month.  I was a little more than two miles from the BZ corner junction when I saw a set of eyes reflecting on the opposite side of the road. I slowed down thinking it was a deer, however as I continued to approach I saw that they were sitting up pretty high. The road dips down on that side just as on mine, there are steep banks here and there. When it began to cross I was a little less than 10 yards from it but through the majority of the encounter I inched towards it to approximately 5/6 yards at the closest. When it came in to the shoulder of my headlights I noticed that the legs weren't thin like a deer or elk they were thick.  I thought it might be a bear, however as it continued to cross I could tell it was way too big to be a bear sitting at roughly 7/8 foot high. I also knew it wasn't a bear because bears are meant to be on all fours it wouldn't have ""arms"" that came down about half way down the thigh (I could tell they came down that far because they swing slightly as it walked). When it crossed over the centerline for a moment it made about a quarter turn with its torso and looked at me briefly before turning back (all as it was walking, it didn't stop at any time while on the road).  I don't recall much of the face but what I do clearly remember was noticing the shape of the head was not at all like a bear, more like a tall bump off of massive shoulders and that there was no snout (that part I noticed as it finished looking away from me). It continued to walk forward in to a ditch along the road with a steep bank (as it did so walking a little bit towards my car as if trying to step out of the light). It awkwardly turned away and I started driving forward slowly. I ended up crossing halfway into the other lane but I would estimate its distance to the side of my car as I began to pass would have been 3/4 feet at the closest.   Once I was pretty sure I had passed it I sped up. I never looked in the rear view mirror, I was honestly too afraid too. The hairs were standing on the back of my neck the rest of the drive. I knew it was watching me as I drove away and the scariest part was I knew it was watching me when I was unable to see it after I passed.  ",,It was just me in the car.,"I was on the phone with my friend Cameren the other day and when I asked if i had ever told him about when I had a ""Sasquatch"" walk in front of my car two years ago he immediately put me on the phone with his father John who said he had a couple experiences implying they were around here but didn't have time to go in to detail. ",Approximately 1:00 AM,the area is forested with light farmland around. Up the road behind where this took place ( a little more than a tenth of a mile) is the end of a clearing for some farmland. The weather that night was damp with a light fog (just heavy enough where its better to drive with your low beams on). ,
53027,4044,35669,2012,Spring,June,WA,Grays Harbor County,,"Pacific Beach, WA",109,"My husband was driving while we were heading north up the WA coast from our little town of Ocean Shores to Moclips, for me to shoot some photos.  I keep my cameras handy while we are driving almost anywhere out of our town.  I like to shoot candid photos of the sights we see.  On June 2, 2012, we reached a curve just south of Seabrook (a newly built, planned community).  My husband pulled over and I turned to look up at the rather bare fir trees standing on the top of the ridge on the east side of the coast road.  I always enjoy looking at those weather bleached trees and have captured their a number of times.  When my eyes moved down to the lower part of the trees, just uphill from our parking spot, I saw a head and shoulder-like shape standing between two trees.  The brush on the hillside hide all but the head and top of part of the shoulder shapes...  I quickly reached for my 'ready to shoot' camera, with its 70-300mm tele-lens, but by the time I aimed the camera at that spot...the head/shoulder shape was no longer 'there'.  I told my husband what I'd just seen...but he didn't seem too impressed.  So, I stepped out of our SUV to shoot some photos looking downhill and out over the beach below our rather high vantage point.  I shot several, including some of wildflowers blooming nearby my husband's driver-side door.  When I was about to walk back around the car to get into it...a sudden loud noise struck nearby.  I immediately looked toward the wide-metal guard-rail, since the loud noise sounded like a heavy stone hitting metal...leaving a vibrating sound.  I saw no stones on the paved parking area...but a stone could have skipped over into the grass and brush just beyond the railing.  I don't know what caused that loud noise...but it was unnerving enough for my husband, who does have a hearing problem, to suddenly tell me to get back into the car.  He had heard it also.  While first parked in that area...we had also seen a large pickup truck suddenly stop just below us right on the curve of the highway...while it was traveling north, as had we been just minutes earlier.  The truck was not sitting in a safe place...it we noted that it made no sense for it to stop in such a blind-spot on a curved in a busy roadway...  The truck had then moved forward 20 to 30 ft. and then suddenly stopped a second time...and hesitated for several seconds before starting on its way once more.  Later...my husband and I speculated that the truck might also have been struck by a rock/stone thrown from that same hillside...  Our rock incident was the second one I know of that occurred within the same week...  I had been told about and shown the broken windshield on a lady's car just days earlier...when a rock had been hurled up, over and out of heavy brush while she drove alone to Aberdeen, Wa from Ocean Shores...passing a swampy area near the Humptulips River.

53061,4046,35706,2011,Summer,September,WA,Snohomish County,This was in the northern Cascade Mountains. It would be too easy for people who have been there to figure out. And I DO NOT want that to happen. I will explain.I think you will understand.,I need this to be kept private please.,See above (I will explain).,"On September 1st, 2011 I was camping up in the beautiful Cascade Mountains of Washington State with my friend Dave (my name is Dave as well). We got there early on Thursday to get the spot we wanted. It was for us the start of the Labor Day weekend. We had set up camp and drove up an old logging road to get our firewood for the night. There is a bridge close to our campsite. We had supper and relaxed around the campfire. At about 10:30 that night I decided to grab a flashlight and go looking around the area across the bridge. I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together. I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife). As I cleared the bridge there is a dead-end road on the right that goes down for about a quarter mile or so. I know this because I have been down there. The road is gated at the top with a pipe gate. In the middle of the gate is a red reflector. I could not see the reflector because something was standing in front of it. I had shined my just regular flashlight, with about ¾ battery power down this road. What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me. I FROZE. I remember thinking: Oh My GOD! I noticed that the right eye was much brighter than the left eye. I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye. Or maybe it had an injury. I then noticed how far apart the eyes were. And how high up from the ground they were. Actually they were roughly even with mine, but the road there sloped down a bit. About four feet or more! Im 58 on a good day. This thing would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all. Just those yellow eyes. There was no odor at all. The air was perfectly still. It made no noise either. I processed all this very quickly. If it would have growled at me it would have been laundry time! We stared at each other for maybe 10-12 seconds. It seemed to kind of lean side to side a little. Without moving its feet. Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle. Pause. Then another circle same as the first. Like an owl, only way bigger. I thought that he had put his hands on his knees maybe. Kind of like I have seen on TV of apes moving.It looked at me for 3 more seconds and I lost it. Not knowing what this thing was going to do next, I took off running to the middle of the bridge and spun around. Every hair on my body was standing up. It did not follow me. I was not surprised. But I was also very happy. I was panting. Mostly from adrenaline, I think! I hustled back to camp and told Dave what happened. I said Lets go back over there. Grab your camera (a digital with a strong flash and video+audio). I was very excited. I knew that this could be a chance of a lifetime to get this thing on film. You have to understand that in my mind, there was nothing else that this creature could be than a REAL Sasquatch. I completely believe it to this day. Anyways, Dave Cannot find his camera. After we looked for a couple of minutes or so I get pissed and said, or words to the effect Lets go while this thing is still in the same county! So we get to the bridge and walk fast at first, then slow way down being quiet. I whispered  You watch the left side and Ill watch this side. Well try to get both flashlights on it at the same time. Daves flashlight was about the same as mine). It wasnt in front of the gate anymore. That didnt surprise me. What I did see was the red reflector. I did not even know it was even there the 1st time. But there it was. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Daves side was a pull-out. It was empty. (The next night some people Camped there). I told Dave Shine your light up the road. There HE was! On my side walking slowly towards us. He had the exact same eyes. The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart. I said Dave, THERE HE IS! Do you see him? Hes coming Dave! There he is!. Both of our lights had shined on this things face at the same time. Only for like 3 seconds or so. But it lit his head up!  The head did not look pointed to me, like many people have reported. It was really BIG though. I was slowly backing up as I watched it walking towards us. Dont you see it ? No he says. I was backing up slowly out of fear as Im watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically.   . Well, it turns out that Dave cant see much in bright sunlight.  At night he is basically following the sound of your voice. So he cant find his camera at the critical time; and I have no witness to this incidence, even though he was right there with me! I love the guy. But FU$%! So I get scared and take off running to the middle of the bridge again, with Dave behind me. The only reason he is running is because I was. You ever hear the joke about never going Grizzly Bear hunting with a friend who can out-run you? Well I out-weight Dave and he had trouble keeping up!   It was HUGE!  Also, although the road was going up hill, it was very straight and flat. I was familiar with this stretch of road, having camped there many times. And this gave me a great idea of how tall this thing was. When I say it was pushing ten feet tall, I feel confident that this is an accurate judgment of its true height. And there were NO tree branches there at all to justify an owl sitting on a limb. If it was an owl, it would have to be 10 feet tall. So we quickly get back to camp. Dave of course, finds his camera. Under his sleeping bag. We jumped into the van and shot across the bridge. Of course we could not find him. I knew he was just inside the trees on one side or the other. It was as dark as the inside of a Buffalo on a moon-less night.     The next morning I walked across the bridge to the top of the road on the right. I walked up to the pipe gate and stood there. Right exactly where HE stood. I paced it off, and it was roughly 45 yards to where I stood when I first spotted him. Boy, I sure will bring a massive candle power flashlight next time! And have a camera ready as well. But you get your chances when they happen. I was not prepared! One thing I havent mentioned. At the time this all happened, I had truly forgotten that in my tent were my two guns. I had my 9mm, plus a 12 gauge sawed-off double barreled shotgun(side by side and barely legal) loaded with 00 BUCK. It had never occurred to me to shoot this guy. I had completely forgotten that I was heavily armed! When he was walking down the road towards us, he, in retrospect, was just kind of shooing us away I think. I think of him as being a gentle giant! He very easily could have run us down and killed us. I feel blessed that they are out there. He did not harass us or threaten us in any way. Other than just leisurely walking towards us and scaring the CRAP out of me!I will go back there this summer,more prepared for sure. STOP!!!!!! - I havent told anyone yet, except for now. I also have a Class B report that happened back in 1975, up it Whatcom County near the Canadian border. This encounter was truly TERRIFIYING! Scared all 3 of us, plus the Big German Shepard ( who PEED himself) that  we had with us in a remote cabin. Ask me about that Story!! Thank you for having this site for us to tell our Bigfoot Stories.  God bless and keep up the good work!

53041,4053,35812,2012,Spring,June,WA,Lewis County,Location is private,Morton,hwy 12,"June 2nd saturday my Mom & I wanted to go back to a place that she had done a BFRO expedtion. She said it had been pretty active,& she wanted to show me around in the day light hours.We met 2 of her Big footer friends on the way down. They drove their own jeep. We were going to the last spot that my mom wanted to show me.She said that it was the one spot that she had got creeped out while on the expedition at night. She also wanted to see this road going down to a clearing in the day time. Just after we had gotten to the spot that she was talking about,we heard a really weird loud whistle-whine-gurgling sound in the brush off to the right of us about 60 feet from us. I was ahead of my Mom by 10 feet or so. We stopped because it surprised us & held real still. The sound stopped....we started to walk again & the sound was louder & got more strange.Like a wild pig that was whisteling under water this time.There were also 3 loud human whistles from the other side of the road, up the hill & father away.I wanted to see what was making this sound & was hoping it was a bigfoot!I went closer to the pig sound & my Mom yelled at me to get back to her.2 trees were shaking now around the pig sound in the bushes.My Mom's friends were driving down with thier jeep to meet us & my Mom was flagging them down.I really really HAD to see what it was ,so I ran to the sound.My Mom was really scared & mad at me. But I am glad that I went to the noises, because I got to see what was making it.When I yelled at my Mom that I was looking right at a little Bigfoot,It stopped making the sounds, let go of the trees & turned around(away from me)I think it hit 2 trees with it's hands or fists on the way,because there were 2 very very loud thuds & the trees shook.It moved really fast into the under growth & it looked like it got down on all fours as it ran away very fast & made all kinds of crashing sounds. The whisteling on the other side of the road started again & the friends of my Mom's got to hear it too.After it ran away all noises stopped & it was dead silent.","My Mom saw a VERY large coyote coming up the middle of the road 10 minutes after all the noises stopped. The little bigfoot was around my height (5'6"") was light beige,had a darker face & hands (I saw 1 hand on a tree it was shaking)the eyes were black or dark brown.It was very clean & soft looking,I was surprised by that.I saw the entire back side of it when it turned to leave(all the way down to the top back of it's legs)It had a kind of pointy head from the back.I did not see much of it's front because it was hiding behind another srubby tree & was reaching around to shake the trees.I was about 30 feet away from it.","yes.My Mom & during the last part of the encounter, there were 2 more women getting out of a jeep to come meet us",,1:45-ish PM dry partly sunny no wind,old road off a logging road going down a hill.trees & bushes on right side.Other side of road has a creek that runs through bushes & trees.hills on both sides of road.Higher hill on the creek side.,2nd
53053,4082,36310,2012,Spring,May,WA,Pierce County,5 miles outside the main entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.,"Ashford, WA",Edited to protect the location,"Personal information edited out by the investigator to protect the privacy of the witness.  Names have been changed to initials.       Timeframe:  The following series of incidents occurred starting in April of 2012.  Possibly as early as April / May of 2011.  Private, full-time residence and immediate surrounding area.   Rural.  Heavily wooded rugged terrain, south-west of Mount Rainier National Park.   There is nothing behind (north) of this location for many miles. There are numerous logging roads thru this area both maintained and old.  Many drainages, streams and game trails  There are no homes or residents throughout the area north of us.  It is mountainous and wild.  Wildlife:  Large deer and elk population, bear, cougar, owl, fox all seen on the property.  If it is native to this immediate area, its likely here.  Incident Descriptions:  April 27, 2012 -  Witnesses: PC and neighbor FP. Around noon on the 27th both witnesses heard exceptionally loud and continuous screams for approximately twenty minutes moving from east to west in the tree-line to the south of their homes as though something was being chased and in fear of its life.  Both witnesss are in their eighties.  PC grew up in the area and returned here to live 2.5 years ago.  FP has lived in the area for over twenty-seven years.  Both are familiar with the sounds of wildlife in the area and both state that they have never heard anything like this before.  The screaming was described as human like, but not human.  Moving rapidly as though being chased.  The sound went through them and scared the life out of them.  When asked why they didnt call 911 they both said that they should have, but did not know what or how to report what they were hearing and thought they would be laughed at.   I (LC, PC's son) was out of town during this incident, but it was reported to me by my mother during a phone call that same day.  During that call I told her that both FP and her had likely heard some elk running through the woods.    May 18/19, 2012  Witness LC (reporting source).  I had just returned home from playing hockey in Seattle and was unloading the car behind my house at 3am.  I felt I was being watched.  It was pitch black out and the Baard Owls were going crazy all around the house.  Then the owls stopped like a switch had been  thrown.  After a brief pause something yelled at me from about 100 to 150 yards away (?) in the woods somewhere between me and the stream behind us anyway.  I have never heard anything like this in my life.  It was human like, but not human.  The sound went right through me.  It felt like a less than lethal crowd control weapon (I spent 25 years in the military / civil service with multiple overseas tours and had been exposed to these).  The hair on my body stood straight up, I felt chilled and distinctly warned off.  I left my hockey sticks in the car (anyone who knows me knows that I do not leave my sticks anywhere!) and went strait inside the house.  I told J (my fiancé) that I was done something just yelled at me out there and called it a night.  The next afternoon my mother, PC, asked if I heard that thing outside last night.  I told her yes and she said that was exactly what she and FP had heard for twenty minutes a few weeks before.  It was not any animal that I have heard before and Ive heard weird owl calls, strange cougar sounds, fox etc.  This was at a volume and resonance that was off the chart.  I could literally feel the sound pass thru me.  For the next few weeks while out back, I was feeling watched  not all the time, but frequently.  May 28/29, 2012 approx. 11pm to 2am  While laying in bed I could hear a faint sound like what was heard earlier in the month.  It sounded as if it was on or near a ridgeline to the north of the house.  Around 2am J said she heard it too and it was really weird.  Aug 12, 2012  I was mowing the lawn in the back (north) of the house when I hit a rock with the lawnmower.  I still have the bruises from where the rock hit my leg as I write this.  Aside from being injured, I was annoyed that there was a rock in that portion of the yard as I had been continuously clearing the area of rocks for quite a few weeks and had that specific area clean.  As I looked around the area I found that there wasnt just one rock, but nearly a hundred rocks all about fist sized laying around the area, about five to fifteen feet from the wood-line.  There are no kids in the area and I do not know of any animals that distribute rocks on the ground as if thrown.     Aug 19, 2012  While visiting with GJ and TJ, a part-time neighbor who has a cabin approx. ¼ mile to the east of us I asked have you heard the screaming man?  When I asked this GJ turned almost white.  He said that both he and his wife TJ had in-fact heard what I was describing a few months ago like May, maybe.  They said they had not reported it because they had no idea of what it was, but that it had scared them too.    Note:  I have been hesitant to write this report, but was convinced to do so by this final report from GJ and TJ.  I started this report by indicating a possible 2011 event.  This occurred from Late April to mid-June of 2011, so the same approx. timeframe of these recent incidents, though separated by one year.  All I can say is that both J and I heard talking between what sounded to be a male and female human back in the woods on multiple nights (after midnight usually).  This was strange as there is nothing back there.  But we both remember hearing only mumbling, no clear speech.  But that mumbling had to have carried for at least a hundred yards plus for us to have heard it.  I wrote it off at the time as potentially game control officers looking for poachers.  But looking back now I also considered it very strange.               If nothing else, I hope this report adds a few more data points to your efforts.  There have been multiple events in this area over the years, but people are very reluctant to discuss them.  You can feel free to contact me and I have the permission of all reporting sources to include their names in this report.  They have also indicated a willingness to share their stories with any follow-on investigation of this report.  ",see report,6,yes,See report.

We had been doing this for about a week. The first time was Friday 17th I had heard some Whoops. Then tonight, Thursday 23 on the same road, National Service Road (edited) I had brought 3 guys and my older brother to the same exact place and we decided to stop a bit and look around, not getting out of the car. I had heard a little bit of Howls and a whoop. At around 10:45 pm I started talking about my first time out there mentioning Eye Shine, then my brother said ""Like those ones over there?"" WE all look out the window there had to have been at least 8 pairs staring back at us. The driver had mentioned how he had been seeing eye shines for a while by then. One of our passengers was extremely scared which then the driver decided it was better to clear out of there and rethink it. WE are planning on returning on Saturday the 25th night time around 10 pm with video cameras, possibly some night vision equipment, and audio files.","three howls, one whoop, and set of slow knocks unsure of the number.

53027,4084,36326,2004,Summer,July,WA,Grays Harbor County,"Traveling from Aberdeen,WA. Head out B Street to Wishkah road. Follow Wishkah road for 10 or so miles. Wynoochie-Wishkah road will be on your right side. It is only a few miles at most to the top of 13 corners. There is no sign postings for the logging road but it is the last pull over area on the left side of the road before you start going down the hill. ",Wishkah,Wynoochie-Wishkah Rd,"My experience happened a few years ago on a logging road between Wishkah, WA and Montesano,WA. The logging road we were on takes you out to the Wynoochie lake.   A friend of mine and I were driving out to meet some friends who were camping. They were a few miles back off the paved road. We stopped the truck to get out and check the bed to make sure we had everything before we got too deep out in the woods. Like food, beverages etc.. It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck). We both get in the truck about the same time and close the doors, dome light goes off and we notice something standing roughly 15-20' ahead of us, in the middle of a single lane logging road. We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me. What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair. The part of the road we were parked was cut out from a small hill. The banks were roughly 6' high on each side of the road. Before we could take a picture, honk, do anything at all, from a standing position it jumped up and was up and over the bank. The headlights didn't show the exact height but in my guess it had to be at LEAST 7'. I'm over 200lbs and it made me look like a baby.  To this day, I still haven't gone down that logging road. If you'd like to know the exact place, it is called the A-Line on top of 13 corners. We were traveling from Wishkah side so the road was on our left. I've always been a believer in Sasquatch, my grandpa was a logger a long long time ago and actually worked while they were building roads to the dam. He told me all about the weird knocks, sounds that he would hear while staying in the cabins out there.  I'm in my mid 20's and have lived in the country for the past 10 years. Love camping and being in the outdoors. I tell all my friends about my experience and still after all these years it still gives me goosebumps when I tell it. I'll never forget that.","Nothing, for the size of whatever we saw you would think that it would make noise when it moved around. We didn't hear anything. Where it jumped up, it would of taken me or anyone a few mins to get up and over. Not many bushes or shrubs to hang on to. I would of had to get down and crawl/climb up it.",My friend and myself were the only ones there. We both just got off work and were heading out to meet some friends camping.,"(2012) I just moved into Aberdeen (town) and before that I was living 10 miles out on the E. Hoquiam road. My fiance and I lived right on the river. At night she would go out for a cigarette and I'd join her because she would hear stuff. We started to hear knocks just about every night. Our bedroom was right by the river. The river is probably 20+ feet from the house. One night we heard knocks really loud and then sounded like splashing through the water. The river is only a few feet deep there and about 6' in the deep holes. Never heard any howls or anything, just quite a few knocks. It was so intense for her, that she wanted to move. She didn't believe in bigfoot/sasquatch or anything. Now she believes and is spooked out.   (This is referring to my story up above) I told my mom about what I saw and maybe 6 months to a year later. About 1/4 mile down the road (closer to 13 corners) going towards Montesano. She was on her way to meet some friends and pulled over along the side of the road to go to the bathroom (its country out here, no rest stops). She thought it was just a stump from where they've been logging but as she got up, she turned around and it was gone. She doesn't stop anymore on that road.  Same area and this is about the same time as when I had my encounter. My basketball coach told me that his mom, who works for fish & wildlife found something strange at work. While her and her partner were walking up and down a small creek. To check for any salmon spawning. She came across a deer that was killed, but not like a bear would kill it or a hunter. The neck/back were broke and the actual spine was ripped back, like ripping it through the hide and everything. She was freaked out and got on the walkie talkie and told her partner. She had to hike up the hill and walk back up to the truck. By the time she meets her partner at the truck, something had packed/dragged/moved this deer up by their truck. She doesn't like talking about it because it scared her so bad.  From where I lived to where I had the incident in the truck is less than a 20 mile radius. A hill seperates E. Hoquiam to the Wishkah road and has many logging roads in between. Then Wishkah to 13 corners isn't far at all.  There is just something about that area. Still do this day there isn't many houses out there and alot of woods. ",Clear Summer day around dusk,Logging road. The area has been logged and was mainly clear cut with brush piles around. ,
53053,4091,36467,2012,Fall,September,WA,Pierce County,listed above,Spanaway,8th Ave E,"OK, last night I went home from Walmart in Spanaway Washington, and I turned  left onto 8th Ave E, which goes from Spanaway highway 7 which is Pacific Avenue also. This street turns into a two lane country road that makes one of the borders of Joint base Lewis-McChord.   It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of  old growth woodlands bordering it. I drove home the back way again tonight hoping to pinpoint the exact location for you, but there are no mile markers nearby where I seen  what I saw. The best I can do, is it is Approximately 4-5 miles out from town, the road is largely flat and straight, but there are a few rises as you drive.   The place I was at was about 3-400 ft from the second place where there is a rise in the road. I know this because I could see the creature with a hill in the background  and some trees, and when we drove up through there tonight there was no place else that  fit those two things.   First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving  with my brights on until payday to get it fixed. I think if I had not had my brights on,  I would never have seen this creature.   At any rate, suddenly I seen the Patterson Film in real life, about 400 ft down the road  ahead of me. The creature I saw fit the same color scheme of Harry and the Hendersons,  but in behavior it was nearly identical to the Patterson film.   It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it.   When you see something that does not fit into the ordinary part of what you perceive as  your reality, your brain tries to pidgeon-hole the data into one file after another, click click click click and suddenly you come up with ""Does not compute"" At first I thought was a smudge on my windshield, but it was moving right along. Just like the patterson film.  So I went to work, and several people live near me and I decided to tell somebody. One guy had a girlfriend who seen him within a mile of my house within a month ago, and  then a week ago his father came home at midnight telling him he had seen one in the same area in the headlight of his Harley where a small creek runs under the road and the  creature appeared to be crossing the road where the small bridge was.   It's weird how this effects you. I could really see how someone could keep this to  themselves for their entire lives. However, when I shared this story, I got ""Oh yeah,  this happened and that happened,"" To ""My Cousin, My Brother, My Dad, and even a  couple of personal stories from people who grew up here.   I was always willing to give it an open mind, but the lack of physical evidence sort of  left me wondering, if I had to be honest. Now I know we share our woods with one big  sumbitch, and you better be paying attention when you are cookin up that bacon at 8 pm in the woods around here cuz I don't think he got that big eatin dandelion greens. :)  My impression, one HUGE Chewbacca/Harry and the Hendersons kinda guy, at least 2.5-3 ft thick thru the chest from back to front and if I had to estimate would be tall even for  a Sasquatch at 9-12 ft like I said it was a quite a ways up the road, but I had time to  see it, evaluate, and question it and look again, and then again after that as it looked  to the right at me coming down the road, so it was a pretty firm sighting even if I am  still questioning myself the next day.   Like I said your brain tries to rationalize anything that ""Does not Compute"" but I was  not under the influence of anything. Still puzzling and marvelling over it all. My urge  to get in a last minute camping trip just evaporated like a puff of smoke lol!  that's my experience and I sure never expected to be posting this :)    ",,nope,listed above,,"clear, dark, bright lights on",12

I and my friend had setup camp for the night along the northern edge of the lake. I woke up around 2 am to hearing very large stomping going through my camp. It sounded like ""stomp stomp stomp stomp"" and I could hear branches being broken as it was walking. I have never heard anything walk so loudly and it seemed to be moving quickly It sounded like it was heavy and was on 2 legs.. What terrified me is that i had reacted to the sound of the stomping by moving to grab my knife. The stomping then stopped and it went quiet. I felt like I was being watched. I didnt have my rainfly on over the tent. I was to afraid to look out and was trying to stay as still as I could in my sleeping bag. After what seemed like hours of waiting, I finally fell back asleep.

Loop area in snohomish county and when we got to our campsite, we saw a couple large footprints along the side of the dirt road next to were we parked, i immediately disregarged it being a bigfoot and figured that it was someone with enormous feet running around barefoot prior to us getting there. as it started to get darker we both had heard what sounded like someone yelling in a deep voice then turned into what sounded like a low tone groan and then stopped, this happened at about 9:30 pm. my girlfreind started to get scared so i told her it was probably just a bear making its sound and i lit a fire and we sat around the fire and talked for a few hours. once we we wanted to go to bed, we climbed into the back of the jeep and as i was closing the back door we heard the same sound again but allot closer to our area. after the noise stopped and about an hour went by we had heard loud rusttling sounds in the bushes on the upper part of the hill on the other side of the road and very loud footfalls and we also heard something very large splashing in the river which was i would say 30 feet from our jeep. we both shined flashlights out the windows but couldnt see anything, as we were doing that a vehicle came down the road and slammed their brakes on just passed our camp site. we heard them get out of their vehicle and started talking so i got out and went to them and asked if everything was okay, and their response to my question was that some massive hairy thing ran across the road right infront of them which they almost hit. they said oh it could of been bigfoot jokingly until i told them the sounds that we were hearing all night and they said that we should probably go then cause that sounds really creepy and that theyve heard of reports in the area of a ""bigfoor"" in the past. now thats kind of the breif rundown of what happened that night, but i am still a skeptic about it but anything is possible, i am millitary i serve in the US army and have seen allot of crazy things so it wouldnt surprise me that its real, but im still a skeptic.

I noticed a very strong sulfur musty smell. My wife said, ""Do you smell that?"" I told her that I did. In my 40 years of being in the northwest woods I have never smelled anything like it. In a few minutes, a medium piece of wood came flying into the camp. This piece of wood hit our trailer and bounced off it, and landed on our wood pile. We both were in shock. My wife said,  ""What the hell was that!?"" We both looked at each other and said, "" You don't think it was you know who?"" The smell left, but in a few minutes it came back. I asked my wife where my NIKON was. It was at this point that a rock came flying into camp.   There were major fires all around us at the time. The animals in that part of the woods were majorly displaced during this time. There is more to this story. We would like to talk with a researcher to tell the rest.

Rainier National Park, and the North Cascades.  Over the last few years I have also enjoyed the show Finding Bigfoot, but I never thought I would be writing about a personal experience.  Oh well, here I am. My employer had a vacation moratorium in place this entire summer because of a major computer software conversion, so as of the 1st of October, I was excited to finally be able to get out in the mountains for longer than a Fri, Sat night.  So Oct 7th, a friend dropped me and my 8 yr. old lab off near Snoqualmie Pass for a Mon-Fri trip cross-country and on the Pacific Crest Trail and had plans to meet me Friday at Pete Lake above Salmon La Sac.  Every day was like the movie Ground-Hog Day, a picture-perfect image of the day before.  I made my way to Pete Lake on Thursday afternoon, intent on being established there when my buddy arrived on Friday.  However, the conditions there were not what I was expecting and the low lake level made for muddy silty water pumping.  So I decided to make the 4-mile push late in the day to another lake and figured I would find a place to camp with a better water supply. From the trail-head at Pete Lake, its about a mile down to where I camped very close to the lake shore.  There were no vehicles in the lot at the trail-head, it was dusk and there was no one seen between there and our camp site.  I took the dog a short distance further down the trail not knowing how far it was to the next parking area where the boat launch is.  With nothing close that way and nearly dark, I headed back gathering some fire wood as there was nothing around our camp site.  When I got back to the camp area and started unpacking to settle in is when things changed.  I was overcome with a feeling of dread, unlike anything I have ever experienced in the back country before.  I had a baby-rattle I had attached to the dogs pack while we hiked to warn bears we were coming, and I carried it all night long shaking it constantly.  I also had a bright goose-neck LED reading light and I clipped it on a tree branch aimed back up the trail so I could see that direction.  I also made an emergency fire for my own protection, even though I figured there must be a ban because of the forest fires.  I had to have the light.  These are things I have never done before, and they seemed totally necessary.  Conditions were like they had been all week; about 50 degrees, clear, and perfectly still.  My dog started growling after dark and this continued intermittently all night. About 8, I heard a very loud high pitched scream from what seemed like across the lake.  The high pitch was immediately accompanied by a lower pitch scream and both went on together for about 4-5 seconds.  Later in the evening, I remember hearing it again, but I didnt note the time.  After my wood supply was gone, we got in the tent and I knew I would be awake all night.  Sometime after 11:00 I heard a loud rock-against-rock sound from again what seemed to be across the lake immediately followed by a 10 second or so roar of rock-fall.  Soon after this, a hoo, hoo,hoo sound came from above on my side of the lake followed by the same exact sound from another direction above (this was defiantly not an echo).  It went back and forth 3 or 4 times so I could really listen closely.  I have to say, my brain was in denial all night, as I had attributed the screams to kids probably partying on the road that traverses high above the other side of the lake (but I never heard laughter, or any other sound, or saw headlights up there or light of any kind).  I figured the hoots were a couple of owls communicating, but listening closely the sound seemed to be coming from a long way off because of the way it resonated through the valley and seemed too powerful to be a little owl.  Anyway, it was just creepy. Then at 2 am I was convinced something was happening around me when a large perhaps bowling ball-sized rock was thrown into the water not more than 20-30 feet from my tent.  I said out loud to my now barking dog well that was either a really big fish, or Then a second rock clunked off another rock on the shore line and landed in the shallow water.  She barked and I yelled to get away from us.  I was terrified.  That was it till the first hint of dawn when I un-zipped the tent to get packed up and get out of there.  The dog immediately bolted thru the tent door and headed toward the water barking.  I told her to stop which she did and I jumped out and took a look.  I never saw anything, but while I was packing up, she sat still staring south into the woods along the shore.  This is not her normal behavior as she usually wanders around smelling everything.  At one point I heard what seemed like a voice that my mind processed as a little old hillbilly man with a cob pipe saying heh, heh, heh.  I cant remember the exact sound, but thats how my mind processed it.  The dog growled and tried to go into the woods in that direction.  I again stopped her, got finished packing and we headed back up toward the trail head.  There was no one camped between there and the trail head, and the parking lot was empty.  It was about 8 AM when we started down the long forest road leading toward the other end of the lake. A family drove by and said Hi as they were heading in to take a hike, and about 9 or so, my buddy rolled up disappointed I wasnt at Pete Lake as he wanted to camp out with me for a night.  I said just get us out of here and well talk about going somewhere far away from here.

Something crossed the river and walked past my tent.  That trail is also off the Mountain Loop Highway.",Granite Falls,Mountain Loop Highway,"About 2001, I was up on Mt. Loop Hwy with my best friend.  We decided to go for a late afternoon hike that we were familiar with, Heather Lake Trail.  In fact, that was our routine exercise spot because we knew it was safe.  Before I explain that incident, there is something else I need to share...we went up there on another occasion and noticed a really LARGE kind of hut off the trail.  It was somewhat difficult to get to due to the steep terrain.  I can't even recall how we even noticed it because it was so well-disguised.  It was enormous, though.  We made it down there and explored it:  heavy amount of broken branches covered over a hollowed out tree stump, roof made of fresh branches, tons of more branches on the floor that appeared to be matted as if it was slept on, entrance was covered by more branches.  I'm 5-03"" and it was high enough to be a 2-story home for a kid's playhouse... about 7ft high.  It was amazing, but very eerie because it was obvious that it was recently built and used.  Also, there was a stinky odor (wet dog).  Within a few minutes, Cyndi and I felt like we were being watched and left the hut right away to continue our hike.  We thought nothing of it after that- didn't suspect a bigfoot at all because that didn't cross our mind.    The original story I wanted to share was one where Cyndi and I went up as the very last hikers on the trail that late afternoon.  A couple coming down warned us about it getting dark and being the last ones.  It takes about 45-50min to hike up and when we got up there, we turned around to head back down.  Before that, we both had to pee.  Cyndi went first and went behind some trees to squat.  She came out with a smurk on her face asking why I had been throwing rocks at her.  I denied doing so, but she didn't believe me even when I said I couldn't see her because I was doing last second site-seeing about 20 ft away.  Then I had to go pee and we switched places and just as I squatted a rock was thrown about my head and hit the tree I leaned against.  There was no way it was Cyndi because I knew she was behind me, not in front.  I freaked out and told Cyndi it must've been some creepy guy watching.  So, we started hollering out ""a**hole.""   It was so silent up there and we can feel like we were being watched yet we knew we were the only ones up there.  I told Cyndi let's go now and we started walking really fast and then we started running.  Parallel to us running on the trail, we could hear/feel the ground stomping and branches breaking.  We freaked out and I grabbed Cyndi and we hid behind a tree off the trail.  The sounds of someone following us stopped.  Then, BAM!  Another rock gets thrown at us while in our hiding spot.  We started screaming and ran down that mountain I swear in 15 minutes.  Bloody scraped legs and wet clothes from sliding down the small water-filled rock beds, we got to our car and cried.  We didn't know who or what that was.  No joke, about 2 years later, I watch on TV a couple describing their face-to-face encounter with a big foot on Heather Lake Trail!  I called Cyndi and now I'm convinced that's what it was.  The smell, the strange hut, rock throwing, ground stomping, branches breaking... we were being followed by a big foot.

It has 5 acres and close to a wild life preserve/park. My husband was the first to tell me he heard something weird. He said it sounded like an owl, but not an owl. I thought he was being silly and ignored it. About 2 weeks ago my husband and I were getting home from a date night (1230 am or so) and I heard the most terrifying sound. It was a shriek similar to the one the female on the Bigfoot hunter show has made (not exactly same but close enough to raise the hair on my back) .My husband said ""that's it! Did you hear it??"" I tried to stay calm and told him it was probably some kids joking around. I didn't want to tell him what I really thought. I've been woken several times since by the same scream and a few nights ago I woke to what sounded like rocks being thrown at our house. I was too scared to look out the window. This was supposed to be our dream home and now I'm terrified to go in our backyard.not sure what to do. If there is some way to get rid of it or make it move on I'd love to know how.",I did hear coyotes after.....

53031,4205,39025,1986,Fall,September,WA,Jefferson County,"From the stump that the bigfoot was standing on, the hwy was bewtween the stump and the bay that it was watching.",Discovery Bay,Hwy 101,"Hello,  I just found out about your organization from your show on TV.  I thought I'd finally report my sighting from sometime ago.  First off, I have been a military officer and I'm finally ready to retire ( just got my 20 years in the Army Guard) and am a very avid outdoors man.  The year was 1986, mid September on a weekend at about 1 to 2 hrs before evening.  It was very bright out, little to no clouds in the sky.   The temperature was fairly mild to warm.  Sunset may of been coming, it was a beautiful day.  Earlier on in the year, there was a show on 60 Minutes (or a similar show) about Vietnam Vets who live in the Olympic Peninsula that live off the grid.  The location was mountain side that overlooked Discovery Bay, in between Port Townsend and Sequim in Washington State.   We were all in my little truck driving up to some logging roads to do some target practice.  Two of my military buddies and two of our mutual female friends were crammed in my truck as we arrived to the clear cut area to do some shooting.   Just in case there was some animals in the clear cut area, I parked the truck back from the end of the road so the sound of the truck might not scare any animals.  As Kevin and Mike were fussing, getting the two girls out of the truck and trying to load up the other rifles, I hopped out of the drivers seat with my shotgun and a few rounds and ran up to the overlook.  I was very nervous as to what I saw standing on a logged stump about 50 to 60 yards away just down the slope in the middle of the clear cut.   There was what seemed to be a very large man wearing a light brown, dusty looking ghillie suit, with his back to me standing on a stump, just staring at the waters of Discovery Bay.  He (or she) was admiring the sun gleaming off the water.  I seriously thought it was one of those Vietnam Veteran hermits that I heard about on TV.  As I stood there, nervous, ...the guys at the truck slammed a door on the truck and then the thing calmly turned around to look up the hill at the sound, then saw me.  It had little neck movement, turning its shoulders with its head.  It moved its feet to turn around on the large stump.  It stared right at me and I stared right back into its eyes.   Then, as it looked at me, I saw total intelligence in its eyes.  I saw that it was not a man wearing a ghillie suit.  I saw its face very well.  It appeared to be a male.  It gave me a calm, peaceful but disgruntled look of 'please be quiet, ..you are annoying'.  As I looked at it, 'he' sized me up and saw that I was no threat to him.  I almost felt that it knew I was no threat.  It definitely had a look of high intelligence.   Anyway, it turned its back at me and continued to stare at the bay.  At that point, my heart jumped into my mouth and I hollered at the guys to get there ass over to where I was and make it fast!  The Bigfoot once again turned around to me again, making the same right hand turn and looked at me for the second time but this time it turned a little faster.  When we locked eyes, it looked even more annoyed or disappointed and maybe a little scared.  It took one long stride off the stump towards the tree line.  It didn't run but it was almost fast walking.  Then appreciating it was between 7.5 to 8' tall, and seeing that huge stride, I hollered to the guys and started running after it.  The guys then saw me sprinting after it over fallen trimmed branches, logs, over stumps with rifle in hand and they knew something big was up.   Before I got half way to it, it already made it into the tree line.  My friends never saw it.  All of us re-traced the steps of the thing after I showed them where it was standing.  We saw a few good prints.  All of us heard it snapping a few big 'loud' branches as it took good cover deeper into very thick bushes.  There was a little bit of a unique smell, unlike anything I've ever experienced in terms of an animal's scent.  It was faint but notable.   I couldn't sleep for a week after that.  I wasn't far behind in my chasing of the thing.  I was extremely bewildered at how it could make it through that very dense brush and not slow down.  Maybe it just got out of our view and sat down and hid in the bushes?  Its almost like it just 'phased' away once it got to where it wanted to go like some kind of strange spirit or something.  If it was an elk running into that brush, it would of got slowed to the point that I could gain on it, but that thing just slipped into the foliage.   Anyway, that's my one and only Bigfoot sighting.  I hope you can find this useful info.  Since I'm about to retire, I'm more inclined to tell my story without getting looked at oddly from my military peers.   You can post this if you would like :-)   Eric S.",It seemed too intelligent to shoot.,"no, but the 4 other witnesses saw the footprints, heard and could smell it as it entered the forest","Yes, various friends would watch one pick apples from an orchard.

The spot where we were fishing was accessible by logging road till it got washed out many years ago, now we have to hike a good mile and a half down a huge mountain side to get there. Because I had to work (I work nights) we decided to leave about 3pm. As soon as we hit the trail and headed into the forest we both had the ""creeps"" for lack of a better word. Wasn't long till we noticed big Cat prints either Cougar or Mt Lynx I believe, that kinda got us looking down at the ground seeing if tracks kept up trail or what. Not long after we heard branches cracking from something stepping on them, that was soon followed by loud footsteps at which time me and Kyle both came to an abrupt stop to listen. After we stopped, whatever it was would take about 3-5 more steps, then must have realized we had stopped and it would stop also, this would go on for roughly the next half mile. At one point he heard it double back at a fast pace roughly about 15-20 steps and mind you this thing was about 200 feet away and we could clearly hear and almost feel each step!!! It got way way crazier when we found a footprint that dwarfed my size 13 fishing boots...the footprint is right foot with toes very visible. Also worth noting ground was hard enough we tried to make an impression but could not. Meanwhile the print was close to a half inch maybe a full inch pushed down into the ground, whatever this was had to be way heavier than me and I'm 6'4 240. I was able to get a good picture thru my phone with my buddies boot next to it. Being that this just happened 2 days ago I believe the print can be relocated! We also found what looked like possible 2 other partial prints but cause we were so rattled we didn't think to get pictures of the partials.

53047,4231,39610,2012,Spring,May,WA,Okanogan County,,Conconully,a dirt road,"What happened to me occurred at my favorite fishing spot on the upper Conconully Lake near the town of Conconully Washington in Okanogan County. The incidents I am about to tell you about happened on 3 separate visits to this spot but they were in a row. The first time I was fishing and had been there a a couple of hours when across the lake I heard several knocks on trees. I looked for up towards the area they had came from and saw nothing.  The hill side has a lot of trees on it and is very steep and no roads on that side of the lake.  On my next trip to same location had again been there for a couple of hours when I heard a big splash from a very big rock landing in the lake several feet out in the water.  The rock came from the same area I had heard the knocking on my previous trip.  I looked the area over to see if I could see where it had come from and if anyone or thing was in the area. I could not determine where it had come from but it had to come from up the side of the hill.  I could see no one or anything else in the area.  I thought to myself that maybe a bigfoot could have tossed it into the lake cause I could not see any man doing it, as it was just too big a rock and it was thrown too far out into the lake.  On my third trip back to the same location my son Robby was with me.  I had told him of my last two visits to the location and what I had heard and saw.  We spent the afternoon there fishing without incident and were packing on our gear to leave when we both heard up behind us, rocks come rolling and the sounds of something very big moving across the hill side above us. It made both of us a little unnerved.  We did not see anything but it was not something we had heard before. It was not a deer as I have seen them in the area before and they had not had any trouble with the terrain and it could have been a bear but I have not seen any bear in that area before. What ever it was that caused the rocks to slide was big and moving at a pretty good pace. It was too far up the hillside for us to see.  Each time I was there the weather was fine and it was in the early spring. It is a great place to fish and I will continue to go there. I haven't heard of anyone else having any incidents like mine before and I have been back to same location many times since without any more incidents like I have just told you about.

I feel people would be put in harms way. ,Indianola Washington ,South Kingston Rd NE ,"I have worked as a wilderness guide for about eight years, many of which where spent in Katmai National Park and the Yukon delta. So it's fair to say I know what lives in the woods, and the behavior of the woods. I will make my story brief. My experience happened in Washington state, mid summer back in 2003. A close friend and myself decided to go shoot some ground fowl in the Indianola area of Wa. After entering a clearing some 1000ft open, we stopped to smoke a cig. I must note the air was still and damp, and I could smell death of a creature close by.  Some time during the smoke I had movement in the corner of my eye. An animal stood 400 or so ft away from me. I know what a bear looks like, I worked as a Brooks River guide. It was not a bear. It was not a person. I'm 6ft 4. It was much much larger and beefier than me. It was not someone messing around. I was armed. But I can say that animal had a stride not matched in North America. It did walk some 200ft from the left to right in my vision. I was not going to shoot it. I wanted nothing to do with it. Needless to say we exited back to the truck back to back. I have not spoke of this due to the fact it would taint my career as a wilderness guide. But note I have nothing to gain or loose, but that animal I saw was your Bigfoot.

I was so scared I could not move at first. But then I ran back into the house and told them what I saw. No one would go out to look they were too scared.

53059,4275,40371,1985,Summer,June,WA,Skamania County,,Stevenson ,Evergreen Highway," In the summer of 1985 I was 17 at Beacon Rock Golf Course in Washington state on the Columbia River just west of Bonneville dam. It was mid morning my dad and grandfather were golfing, I was playing caddy for them. It was on the second fairway, a long mostly straight hole. My dad's tee shot went into the woods and brush on the right hand side about 1/3 of the way down, I told him I would go look for it. I grabbed a 7 iron and made my way into the bushes. I was poking around, pulling back branches looking for the ball when I smelled what I can only describe as something rotten, it was really bad. I thought I had uncovered a dead animal with the club. As I continued to move brush around I looked up to see if I should go in a bit further. That is when I saw something about 10 - 12 feet away standing next to a tree. It was approx. 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall with very broad shoulders, fully covered in hair, a bit lighter brown on top and got darker as it went down, almost to a black as it got to mid chest. I couldn't see anything from the knees down due to the underbrush. I have been hunting with my dad since I was 13 and have lived in the country most of my life. I know what I saw was not a bear, I didn't know what I was looking at, but I know I had never seen anything like it. I turned to scream at my dad and grandfather, but no sound came out, I was truly terrified, I turned back to see if I was seeing things and it was moving up the hill at a quick pace, not running but walking quickly, never made a sound, other than the occasional swish of a branch bouncing back to place. I turned and ran out of the tree line never looking back. I caught up with my dad and grandfather who had walked past me up the fairway at some point, they were about half way to the green. I never said what I saw or smelled, just that I couldn't find the ball. The whole thing lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.

We were a quarter mile from the road, it was 1 am and we were standing on a large log, all three of us a few feet apart, casting. The river is approx. 100 feet across, the other side very steep, devils club, etc, going up into wilderness of the O.N.P. (Olympic National Park). The river erupted ten feet in front of us, a thunderous crack and then a soaking, knocking over one of our three lanterns. We each though one of us did it, then two more close together, ""crack-crack"", wall of water, soaking us. Then in the dim lantern light comes two watermelon sized rocks (how far could you throw one??) from the other side, two more thunderous splashes. My friend Mark said ""Look across the river!! What the @@#$ is that!! With just enough light we could see two huge figures standing on the ledge rock on the other side, swaying back and forth, eyes glowing turquoise green in the lantern light. The river was high and uncross-able from rainfall. We ran like hell, blindly down the thin fishing path downstream to one of the few gravel bars in the area. The instant we popped out on the bar, another huge rock lands in the water a few feet away. We ran out frightened to death, dove into my friends truck and sped home; we never spoke of this for years. It was the most scared I've ever been, my friend had just got out of the Navy, he was a bad a** and he was frozen in his tracks scared.  This was January 23rd, 1982.

53027,4277,40381,2012,Winter,December,WA,Grays Harbor County,Edited to preserve the privacy of the witness.,Ocean Shores,Ocean Shores Blvd,"Witness' Report: As told to Scott Taylor and Rayn Moonflower. The witness does not own a computer.  I had been helping some neighbors with a repair, and since I dont drive anymore, they took me home. It was about 2:00PM on Dec 26th 2012. The car had several people in it when they dropped me off. I was up on my porch, getting my keys out to open the front door when I heard screaming coming from the car which was still in the driveway. Wondering what they were arguing about, I turned to look at them, and saw that they were frantic, pointing to the back of my yard. I turned to look at what they were pointing at, when I saw a very large, hairy, upright form crossing a little cut in the brush at the back of my lot. There were three deer with it, two in front and one behind. That seemed strange. The deer were unconcerned. We have a huge population of deer here. I knew immediately what it was.a bigfoot. I noted a tree limb that was even with its head. One step and it was gone. I went out there and marked the limb where its head was with a piece of white rag.   The next week, on January 3rd around 2:30PM, I was out at the back of my property with my loppers. I was cutting a trail through the very thick brush so that I could get to the next street easier. There are narrow deer trails and I was on one of those. I smelled something really bad. It was like a ripe garbage can. I made my way in that direction, clipping branches, when suddenly I saw something on the ground in about 6-8 feet in front of me. At first, I couldnt see what it was, and then it moved. I was frozen in fear. I am on oxygen, and knew I could not run. This thing arose to hands and knees. It was hairy and brown, with silver gray hair on its back. It reminded me of a giant pile of steel wool. I thought it was a bear at first. It was supporting itself on its right hand and knees. The left hand was off the ground. It turned its head and upper body to look left and looked at me. My fear level was a 10! I dropped my loppers without moving. He then looked away from me, shifting his weight to his left hand. He brought his right hand up in front of him and rubbed his thumb on his fingers while he looked right, then forward as if he were reasoning out which way to go. Then he looked back at me, but his expression changed, and my fear level dropped. He looked intelligent. After a few seconds of considering what to do, he took off in the direction he was facing, straight ahead. On all fours he slithered along the ground, going under limbs and up a little rise for about 15 feet. Then I saw him stand up momentarily, and then duck down and dart away to the right. It was at that moment that I decided to run, to heck with the consequences. I made it back to my yard and about halfway to the house when I collapsed. After resting, getting my breath, and collecting my wits, I went back there. I found what I think is a hand print, and placed a bucket over it to preserve it.  After thinking things over, the next evening, I called the police. Two officers were there within minutes. They arrived around 6:30PM. They were very re-assuring. They said to not worry, and to just tell them what happened, as they see strange things all the time. I told them what happened. They stayed with me for a couple of hours. They did not make fun of me and were supportive and re-assuring.  I dont own a computer, and dont even know how to turn one on. I started asking around for some friends in real-estate to look for some organization to report this to. Eventually, someone found your number and gave it to me. I thought it was a Montana phone number. I called an left a message. ","The creature was walking with three deer, as if they were all together.

The house is on the Ocean side so critters and brush moving is normal but this night was different, it was very dark and too quiet, not even a frog croaking.  I heard an extra amount of brush rustling then normal, then a high pitched animal screamed out, which I now identify as a rabbit in great distress (I put out food for the wild rabbits). A short span of silence then something stumbled or fell and let out a deep moan.  I rain into the house to grab a flashlight and went back out on the deck. As I was trying to find the switch for the dang ancient lantern type flashlight I heard more brush moving, then 4 loud thuds on this fake wooden dock that's on the northern edge on the lot. The dock goes into the brush where fresh water collects during rain season and just ends, is about 20 feet long and begins at the edge of the yard which is also the NW corner of the deck support. Four thudding stomps then off the dock onto the lawn, two more stomps and the creature stopped directly below me standing above on the deck.  I froze, it froze and then it started smelling me! Deep long inhales, short outs, I could not see much thru the deck boards just something dark and big and frankly it was so frightening that this creature was just a foot or so underneath me below my feet. I said screw the lantern and ran for the house.

We had been talking about going up since the snow melted and we could get back up to the site. Anyway Friday July 5th we finally got the chance to go up. There was ""J.H,"" ""J. McK"", ""C.C. Jr"", ""G.C."", ""J. Mc"", and myself, ""R.S"". ""J"" brought his Night Vision Goggles. None of them had a vehicle that could actually get to the site as I had before so we parked off the main  road and decided to hike up the road and see how far we could get. So we eventually got to about a quarter up the road and my legs started hurting, I am a bit over weight so I had to stop and rest because the group was so excited and intrigued by what we may find/ see that they wanted to get to where I saw my huge sighting last summer. So after being stopped for about 5 minutes I suggested to ""J"", who had brought a wooden broom handle, to do 6 tree knocks because there were 6 of us there. So we waited silently for about 2-3 minutes and we got a low sound of one knock from what sounded like 20 or so feet off the right hand side of the road, if we would not have been quiet we would have missed it. Then we all turned to focus on that side of the road and saw 2 sets of eye shine, one a silver bluish color and the other orange. The orange one's eyes where almost on top of each other as if it was leaning up against the tree or something or turned its head in a question like manner. Then the group decided I should try to call out to them so I decided to try some whoops. I turned my back toward them just in case they could actually see me so I could make it sound as if it came from the opposite side of the road and let out a series of about 6-8 whoops each last about 5-10 seconds in length of variant volumes then ended with a loud one that lasted about 8 seconds. After about 15 seconds or so we heard a low grumble type sound, not quite a growl but very guttural. Then a short (about 4-6 second) low whoop. By now it was about 30 minutes of us staying at this site and ""J"" and I started to get very scared of something on the road ahead of us not sure how far up the road. Eventually we started to see a very bright pair of the silver bluish eye shine up in the trees moving around, we though it was a young one. All this time the 2 off to the right side of the road were still there. There is a shallow slope on that side of the road that was some where between 3-4 feet to the height of the road then they came to about our eye height so I am guessing that they were somewhere between 7 and 8 feet tall. After 45 minutes we decided to turn back to the quarry/ gravel pit. When we were almost there we heard a low moaning sound that they do, come from the left side of the road which in this area is a hill and goes up from the road about 15- 20 feet. So we stopped and they asked me to try to imitate that sound. I tried my best but it sounded to much like a moo. Anyway I then asked ""J"" to do another round of tree knocks. No response this time so we carried on back to the quarry area. I then heard some rustling in the grass from within this open area, I asked for the NVGs and as I searched the area I saw one walking in the grass. Once it noticed that we had seen it it hunkered down and moved back into the grass. I passed the NVGs to ""J"" who had been the most skeptical about the whole thing and wanted to see what I was seeing. Eventually it got passed around so everyone could see it. ""J"" wanted to push forward and surround it and possibly catch it. I opposed that idea but said lets move in slowly so we could hopefully get a better view of it in the NVGs so we got some where around 10-7 feet from it before we had a rock thrown off to the side of us, I asked for the goggles and when I saw it, it was giving the motion that it wanted us to back off. So we slowly made our way back to the car. The one we saw in the quarry area was about 6-7 feet.","We heard about 6 whoops the entire time, a total of 4 knocks, 1 howl/ moan.","There were 6 of us.

We hadn't seen any sign of life at all the entire night covering several roads off mountain loop hwy, this was no exception. We stopped at the outhouse there at Coal Lake and walked up to the lake, at the time I thought it was weird that there was no wildlife at all. I mean none, no birds, nothing. After looking around a bit we got back in the truck and headed down the hill. We drove about 1/4 mile and found a small pile of scat in the road so I stopped to look at it, that's when I got a feeling that I was being watched. I went back to the truck and grabbed  my rifle and continued to look around. As I cleared the rear of the truck and approached the edge of the bank I started hearing some thrashing below me. I got excited thinking we found a bear but the longer we sat the less excited and more uneasy I got. The thrashing didn't move unless I moved. I worked my way down the road past the front of the truck trying to see what was making the noise but couldn't see it. I did get really nervous at this point because the thrashing followed me down the road. I have hunted elk and bear in Montana and Washington my whole life and never had one parallel the road with me nor be that close without growling. I was very well armed with a sidearm and a heavy magnum rifle but I had no interest in exploring this more.

53031,4379,42304,2013,Fall,September,WA,Jefferson County,"Lena Lake, Buckhorn wilderness.",Brinnon,Hwy 101,"Last month I went on a backpacking trip in the Buckhorn Wilderness, to a small alpine lake about two hours into the wilderness; called Lena Lake. I went with my mother and we accompanied a group of people on this two day backpacking trip. When we got to the lake everyone set camp and it was time to start preparing dinner. I went down to the shore of the lake to explore while everyone was at camp. When I got there I was surprised to see tons of barefoot tracks everywhere. But what caught my attention was how these tracks were so unusual, they did not look like some random people were walking around barefoot in the mud. It wasn't exactly the size of them that caught my attention but how deep they were in the mud. Whatever it was must of been at least around 200-300 pounds or more because I'm around 130 pounds and jumped as hard as I possibly could in the mud, and I barely made an indent. Whereas the prints I was looking at were around 4 to 5 inches deep. Also what struck my attention was the raised area of the foot. I looked up Bigfoot footprints online and they described it as the mid-tarsal break. All of the footprints I was looking at by the lake had a mid-tarsal break. I looked up photos of Bigfoot tracks and one of mine looked very similar to the track photographed in the Hoh Rainforest in 2005.  All the tracks seemed to come from a family, for some were very small and others were larger. The tracks lead into the water and out from another shore of a shallow part of the lake and I followed them up into the gravel as they disappeared into some boulders and large rocks by the lake. I couldn't understand how people would walk around barefoot in the rock and gravel especially when it was a very cold time of the year. The tracks looked about a few days old because I could tell they weren't fresh, but they were so unusual and looked so like the ones online that my instincts told me that these were not human footprints. ",The mid-tarsal break in the footprints makes me believe that they were not human footprints.,Just me.,"I found another report that took place in the Buckhorn Wilderness as well in an alpine lake. It may be the very same lake, but they didn't specify if it was Lena Lake.","In the evening, the weather was drizzly with part sunshine.","Very remote area of Olympic mountains.

I was sitting at a stop sign at a T in the road. I looked to my left and saw something come out of the woods. As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror. I was too shocked and scared to even pick up my cell phone and take a picture of it. I watched it walk across the road to the other side of the woods. It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs. It was not a human as I looked for shoes, hands, facial features. It was black and hairy with long arms. It has taken me so long to say anything to anyone as I never knew where to report it to. Plus I didn't want people to think I was crazy. It never looked at me  But just stared straight ahead. I told my husband about it and he didn't know what to think.

53031,4386,42408,1982,Fall,November,WA,Jefferson County,,Lake Quinault,NFR 2433,"    I was hunting late Elk (doe) up in the Olympic National Forest in late Oct or early Nov.   I was hunting alone on an old logging road I'd picked because it went into the mountains the farthest. Due to my job (ARMY), I arrived late, just before sundown just as a couple were hauling up the last piece of an elk doe his wife had shot that morning.   He was still cussing her because she watched it cross the road in front of her and waited until it got to the bottom of the ravine before shooting it.  Well they left and I spent the night in my truck.   All night it snowed lightly, which is great for tracking. I was parked at the end of NFR 2433, I arose before dawn and just stayed in the back of the truck, I had a clear view down the road for about half a mile. I hadn't seen anything all AM when suddenly I saw what I thought was another hunter step out into the open on a curve in the road about 1000' away. He/it looked at me, walked to the edge of the road overlooking a 500' drop to the valley floor & it just froze there, it looked like it was scanning for game. All I could see besides its outline was its head occasionally scanning.      What struck me odd about him at first was no sign of a rifle, he was all black, and very big, even at the distance we were apart.   There being know one else around I figured he'd walk over to me & BS for a while, but he just stood there motionless for a couple of hours! I was starting to creep me out the more I watched him, because I started noticing little things like I could see no signs of a weapon, no bright orange hunting colors or anything that I could differentiate as clothing. I consider it inappropriate to point a high powered rifle w/scope at someone, so I never scoped it out.     As there was nothing else to see, I watched him for several hours, and seemingly he never moved!  Finally he took one giant step over the edge going down into the canyon. Its this move that caught my eye, I figured he was going to just sit on a boulder down there.   At this time I still thought it was another hunter.   I figured what the hell, I'll offer him a cup of coffee so I walked slowly down there.   When I got to where he went over the edge, there was nothing there.   That is when the hair stood up on the back of my neck & I started looking for tracks.   The corner he had been was in the sun & all the snow had melted, but only a few yards away, to the south the road was still in the shade, NOT ONE SINGLE TRACK!!   That meant it could only have come out of the deep woods as there was still an unbroken blanket of snow further down the road. The only way he could have got there was down the mountain.   And that meant it wasn't a man.    This really creeped me out, I very cautiously crept back to my truck & left the area. Never went back.    I now know what I saw was a Squatch, not a man.   I wonder to this day if the smell of the slaughtered elk doe from the day before may have attracted him.",,,,Morning,"Pine Forest, steep mountain",15

Route 109 halfway between Hoquiam/Aberdeen and Ocean Shores Washington. I was driving back from Hoquiam to Ocean Shores where I live when a deer ran across the road heading south about an eighth of a mile ahead of me.  From experience I know that if one deer crosses the road there is a good chance that another is right behind it and so I slowed way down.  Instead of a deer, here comes this guy that makes it across the road in three strides at a dead run.  I came to a complete stop, somewhat in shock...like ""what the HELL am I looking at?"" This guy (yup it was a male, no question about that..)stops at the top of the roadside berm, turns around and looks right at me.  He gave me a grin that was CLEARLY a threat, turned back around and vanished into the roadside brush. So I got to see a Sasquatch up close and personal.  My window was down and I was no more than 20 feet from him.  His face was human looking except that he had no chin and he had a somewhat heavy brow ridge.  The nose was a human nose and was more european than african looking.  The eyes were black, the skin was grey as was his hair and he had more or less human teeth...what was left of them.  His teeth were in terrible condition.  When he ran, his palms were down, not thumbs up like us, and when he stood his palms faced back rather than thumbs forward like a person.  The arms looked a bit longer than a human but not more than half a hand length longer.  Also since it was around one in the afternoon and I was looking south at him I could see the shape of his head through the hair in the sun.  The hair sticks way up and makes him look like he has a pointy head but really the shape of the head is human.  My guess and it is only a guess,  is that he was about 7-8 feet tall.  I didn't have time to take a picture.  It all happened so quickly. ","As I said in the writeup, the hands are turned inward more than a human and the arms are slightly longer.

Both occurred within a mile of each other yet were decades apart. Having read the report from a hunter near a lake outside of Packwood I wanted to submit this as his encounter and mine are very similar and may be the same creature.  The first encounter was in the mid 70's. The location was Chambers Lake SE of Packwood and close to The Goat Rocks Wilderness. It was early spring with the access road to the lake buried in heavy snow. We had walked in approximately 3 miles leaving my dads car at the creek. There were no human tracks leading into the area. Only the weather worn tracks of what looked like a forestry snowcat.   We fished for brook trout from the logs near the camping area. We had caught several when we heard the sound of shifting rock on the slope across the lake from our location. As the slope was buried in several feet of snow it had to be something large to displace the rocks.  Maybe ten minutes later something let out a horrible screaming howl from the tree line that borders the lake directly below the slope. It was incredibly loud and forceful. It scared both my dad and I. It then sounded like it was tearing up the brush and limbs. So my dad said we needed to leave.  My father was a judge and not easily intimidated but he was visibly frightened. He grabbed our rods and took out his pistol. He said 'come on' and started walking without even reeling in the lines. We hiked up the snow covered access road and down the logging road. My dad kept looking back behind us as we could still here the thrashing sounds until we were 1/2 mile away.   We finally got to the car and left  The second encounter was in 1998. It occurred approximately 1 mile from the lake. My friend and I had just arrived to hunt elk in the area between Chambers and Walupt Lake. It was November.  We were truck camping on a gravel site that overlooks the valley. It is on the same ridgeline that leads to the slope behind Chambers Lake. It was evening and we were sitting beside a fire discussing the next days hunt.  Suddenly there was that same horrific screaming howl coming from the treeline approximately 100 yards from our truck. The creature was very loud and was moving closer as it vocalized. We could hear what sounded like logs or limbs being thrown in our direction. We quickly got into the truck and spent the night in the cab. We did not here further vocalizations but also didn't go out to listen either.  Let me note that I am a lifelong hunter with extensive knowledge of animal behavior and identification. I am also a well educated naturalist that could identify most every Cascade animal by sound. This was not a bear, cougar, elk, porcupine, wolf, coyote or bobcat. I would doubt it was a human as it was obvious that we were hunters and the distance was within east range for either of us.   This was the exact same noise I heard with my father two decades earlier and within a mile of the first encounter. In subsequent years I have hiked the game trails along that ridgeline and they connect between both locations with well worn paths. In fact the truck was parked across the path as it transects the gravel site.  It appears as if this is a creature that lives in that area and doesn't want people infringing on its territory / food supplies (we were fishing and hunting during these events).  I spoke with the BFRO investigator a couple years back as he investigated a neighbors sighting near Eatonville. But felt I should submit this report in the event that others may have run into this creature near Chambers Lake. By its behavior I would be surprised if these were singular events. ",Both encounters within a mile of each other.

After I had fed the horses and closed up the barn I went to tend to the fire as I was standing there is when I heard a call, the closest thing I can compare it to is a howler monkey/ whooping crane mix type call with a low (almost subsonic) growl or rumble that was mostly felt, not audible.  The first call I didn't quite pay attention to, however the second call made my hair stand on end, and it was close (I would guesstimate within 100 yards). It was dark and because of the fire all I could see in that direction was darkness but I felt that I was being watched and possibly being called to. The call was not strained as in trying to carry distance but just to be heard.  I was frozen for a moment then I turned and quickly headed to the house when I heard the call one more time.

Mount Pilchuch was the nearest mountain in the range.,Granet Falls,Mount Loop Hwy. ,"August 1974 I and my three friends Tom, Byron, and Jay went camping with their parents who slept inside their camper while we slept on the ground with a plastic tarp draped over us.  It had been raining the day before.  Around 2 am I was awakened by an eerie screaming.  It sounded like a woman was being murdered.  It freaked me out.  The screaming was across the Stillaguamish River which was about 50 meters from where we slept and into the forest on the other side.  Across the river was a steep incline into the rustic forest and beyond that was nothing but wilderness all the way into Canada.  The screaming became louder and louder as the thing that was screaming was getting closer.  I heard it walking down the steep hill on the other side of the river, and then I heard it walk up and down the other side of the river, screaming all the more.  It was very loud and very scary.  It gave me the impression that it was angry.  Angry at us for being in its area and it wanted us out.  That was my impression.  I was scared to death and I did not know what to do.  Then, suddenly, the thing walked across the river towards me!  It came to my side of the river and began to walk up and down the river bank screaming all the louder.  Then it stepped on a fallen tree that was on the river bank and I heard a snap as the weight of the thing broke the log as it stepped on it.  Then the thing walked up to me and my friends and came within 10 feet of us and screamed some more.  I thought it was going to kill us.  Just then I noticed the terrible odor that this thing had.  It was overwhelming!  It was so strong it made my eyes water.  I was petrified.  I was too scared to move, to speak, to do anything.  I really thought it was going to kill me.  It was lasting forever!  This thing was standing over top of me, screaming, smelling horrible, and scaring me to death.  Then he started to simply walk away.  It went back to the river and walked across it to the other side.  Then it climbed up the steep hill and into the forest screaming all the time.  The screams became farther and farther away.  When it was a good distance away I started to believe that it wasnt going to kill me.  I then asked my friends, Tom, Byron, Jay, did you guys hear that?  They all three jumped up and yelled at me yes what the hell was that?  It seems they were just as terrified as I was and were frozen stiff with fear.  The entire episode lasted for approximately 25 minutes.  What did I see?  I saw nothing because it was pitch black dark.  I heard and smelled everything.  It was as real as it could possibly have been and we are convinced that it was some kind of monster.  It walked on two legs just like a human.  I have been shot at, artillery shelled, sniper shot at, have had a hand grenade tossed at me, survived an ambush, and IEDs while in combat.  I have been attacked by a 12 foot shark while scuba diving.  I have been face to face with three adult man eating lions that were pets of Saddam Husseins son.

Only about 100 yards to my friends house but there was a barbed wire fence halfway. We jumped the fence and I looked back as I went over. What I saw still gives me goosebumps.

We could hear the creature throwing the trash cans and stuff at the house. When my friends dad got home, we went outside to check out the damage.

Then one night I came around the corner driving north on Snohomish Ave. towards my road coming home with a friend and right before my road there was a swamp, I came around the bend and saw eye shine so I slowed to a crawl so not to hit what it was. Then I inched closer and it came across the road, I thought it was a pony at first then I saw its size was disproportionate. Its back end was taller than the front.on all fours. It turned and looked at us right before it went into the darkness and I thought its face reminded me of a sloth. I still didn't know what I'd seen. It wasn't dark brown. It was a light color like grey or maybe white. Then I pulled forward and my friend and I rolled down the side window and tried to see where it went and we smelled a strong sulfur smell, but we couldn't see anything and we got scared and went home. I tried to look up if we have some species of giant sloth in Washington. Now days I've been better educated about Bigfoot from watching shows on TV and I'm very sure that is what we saw that night. My friend was convinced it was Bigfoot that night but I wasn't sure because it was on all 4's & wasn't brown or black. Now I know, that its the only thing it could've been. I think it was running out of habitat and with many other wildlife was driven east thru that neighborhood. It's unknown if it is there still as I moved a long time ago and haven't felt stalked since.","Something or someone made a rope out of pieces of this & that like dog leashes, bungee cord, old phone cords etc. & they tied it to a tree & threw it over my house when I had a hole in the roof where light shined in. My friend thought he saw someone on my roof before I had found the weird rope the next day. Then I mentioned it in town & heard another person in my neighborhood had a similar incident. ",,,The calls were mostly at night or early morning late evening. Saw the creature at night.,Swamp on one side & a horse pasture is where the sighting occurred & the calls were heard in a partially to heavy trees with underbrush & sticker bushes spaced intermittently in 5 acre tracks by rural housing.

53077,4516,45360,2014,Spring,June,WA,Yakima County,"OK to post online: Location was at Bumping Lake, Upper Campground site #37. Very end of the campground loop.  And on Swamp/Cougar Lake trail.","Yakima, WA",Chinook Pass SR 410,"Let me begin by stating that my mother Renae Sampson is a member of the BFRO and has gone on multiple expeditions, is fairly knowledgable about Bigfoot activities and sightings, and has shared her stories with me. I am somewhat of a skeptic, but believe there is always a possibility of discovering new creatures on our planet, but until this past weekend I had never experienced anything first hand.  Growing up in central and western Washington, my whole family has always enjoyed the wild outdoor spaces whether camping, day hiking, fishing or just exploring old mountain dirt roads. This past weekend June 7-8, 2014 was no different...   We made camp at the upper Bumping Lake campground using 2 small tents and a picnic table tent. The weather was in the upper 70's to low 80's during the day, we had 3 young children ages 4-9, and 4 adults age 37-62. (Whether that's notable or not, I don't know- but I added it in case.) My brother and his family joined us only for the day leaving around 5pm. We rode bikes, played in the water, ate lunch, hiked around the campsite on animal trails, normal camping activity with kids. One notable strange thing happened happened around 6pm...  My 4 year old son needed to use the restroom and we decided to walk through the small island of trees at the end of the campsite paved loop. We startled a deer in there and I remember thinking ""that's strange to see a deer in here with so much human activity around the campsites"" I wanted to try and take a pic with my iphone and tried to walk a bit closer. My son stayed right at my heels, also being curious if we could get closer. I don't know why, but I always call wild animals ""baby"" and spoke to this deer: ""it's ok baby, we won't hurt you"" etc. (And I honestly never would, no guns or any type of weapons for my family)   So we move forward, the deer slowly walking away a few feet, nibbling some leaves, me moving forward, Deer looking back at me, deer nibbling leaves, the deer never being more than 20' away from us, until we emerge from that small island of trees, cross the paved road into an empty campsite near the restrooms. It was almost as if it wanted me to follow, it kept looking back at me, but never running off. My son looks up and says, ""I don't want to follow that deer anymore, Mama"" and I try to coax him along a bit more. He was adamant and did not want to enter that part of the forest. I follow the deer a bit more trying to get that ""one great nature photo"" and then I lost the deer over a small rise. I even crouched low to see if I could spot moving legs-nothing. What is interesting about this is that my son is very outgoing, adventurous and always wants to lead the way. Was some instinct holding him back? (Whether this is notable or not, I included it anyway)  After dinner, my mom, son and I went for a drive up the dirt road (1800) all the way to the end and back. Got back to camp about 9pm, made a fire, sat around and told stories, watched bats flying, watched for shooting stars. The night was calm with not much of a breeze to notice, few clouds in the sky. The moon was in its waxing gibbous phase and visible in the southern sky straight up from our campsite. I put my son to bed in our tent, then stayed up with my mom at the campfire till midnight. I simply couldn't keep my eyes open any longer and quickly fell into a deep sleep. Here's where it gets interesting and something I will never forget...  Maybe its the cool night air (approx 54F) or the glass of wine before bed, but I had to wake up and go potty. As I lay trying to convince myself to get out of my warm cozy sleeping bag and don my slippers to outside behind the tent, I hear off in the far distance toward the South part of the lake a ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" and my brain races to identify the sound. By the time I realize I am hearing rocks clacking together I hear it again, in a definite pattern ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"". Now I am wide awake, on alert and must pee now! I have to say, I did not much want to get out of my tent at this point. Nevertheless, I did, and quickly went potty behind my tent and hopped back into bed. I remember thinking ""what the hell is that?"" I grabbed my headlamp and noted the time on my watch as a few minutes past 2am. I wanted to remember this and tell my mom in the morning. I would say I listened to this clacking occurring repeatedly every couple of minutes for approx. 10 minutes and somehow fell back to sleep.  Here's where it gets freaky! I'm fast asleep and become aware that there is the sound of stampeding animals right behind my tent. Still in a haze of sleep, my head on my pillow up against the wall of our tent, I feel what seem to be fingers touch the back of my head in what I can only describe as a ""hard petting"". I feel the end of my tent beyond my feet on the inflated bed my son and I are sleeping on LIFTS UP! And then its placed gently back on the ground, like floating down! I reach out to touch my son and he is facing away from me with his arms and hands under the covers. He had not touched me....what did?!  I hear something brush the side of the tent! And then, I hear my mom's voice in a loud shouting whisper: ""Jennifer!!"" I am awake and alert and scared at this point and try to call out to her but my voice won't come out. I am barely able to utter a weak mumble sound.  I hear the clacking rock sound closer now, in the near distance south of our tent in the ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" pattern, with a responding ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" from further away maybe south-west, maybe even from the other side of the lake. And then the closer sound again this time, rapidly: ""CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK""  I have to tell you I was completely petrified with fear at this point, could not move or speak. Somehow, like a miracle, I fell back to sleep.  Again, with that night chilly air I woke with the need to pee. I woke up thinking ""Something weird is going on here"". I could still hear the occasional clacking far off now, in the southern distance. No longer feeling petrified with fear, I don my slippers, quickly potty behind the tent again and dash back to bed. I notice the sky is still dark, full of stars and the moon positioned in the south western part of the sky right above the mountaintops. I did not check the time, but imagine it was around 4-5am.  I don't remember sleeping well, filled with fright and thought ""next time we're sleeping in my Explorer"" and then it was 8am. I could hardly wait for my mom to wake so I could tell her what happened. I rose before Mom and my son and walked around our campsite looking for any sign of a visitor. No Bigfoot footprints. My tent was still firmly staked down. Couple of fresh deer tracks on the trail behind our tents. WHAT THE HECK??!!  Mom woke up and I recount my story to her of the night's events. She states she was not awake at all during the night, and doesn't remember calling out my name. The funny thing about that is that I've gone by ""Jen"" for 20 years, and only my parents still call me ""Jennifer"". Weird.  We pack up camp with the intent of going to the other side of the lake for a hike along the Cougar/Swamp trail for a spell before we headed home. We wanted to get to the Boulder Creek crossing and were curious if my 4 year old son could make it. He did, and we had fun taking pics along the way, had a snack break, met some folks on the trail on the way back, not too hot, not too breezy...all in all a nice day.   When we were about 15 minutes away from our cars at the trailhead, we heard a sound. A sound my mom and I have never heard before. We were in a thick wooded portion of the trail: close to the water on one side, and fairly straight up elevation on the other- meaning the hillside rose steeply upwards. I do not think either of us would be able to easily climb up this land covered thickly with Kinnickinick, Bunchberry, ferns, and many many trees growing closely together.   This is where the sound came from...directly above us! Hard to describe, but sounded like this: ""HUMPF"" like coming from deep within a large animal, kind of guttural, but not a growl. And it was loud. And close. And no other sounds like the animal moving or walking through this thick vegetation. We all stopped and looked at each other wide-eyed. We looked up into the woods a bit but could not see anything through the thick plant life. I was a bit on edge and thought, ""let's get out of here!""   We continued the hike back to our cars and I remember thinking to myself, ""that was weird"", and what a weird night I had just experienced and why isn't my mom talking about this more?? She's the Bigfoot fanatic in our family! Didn't she think that was strange? Maybe she was meant to forget? Or not notice? I understand Bigfoot may have powers beyond our knowledge or capabilities. You never know...  So, that is my story to the best of my recollection.  It scared the hell out of me. I literally felt paralyzed. I am intrigued. I will continue to go camping, and maybe...just maybe have another encounter-if that's how you would classify this story.",,"Myself, my mom Renae Sampson, and my son",My mother Renae Sampson is a BFRO member and has gone on multiple expeditions over the past 3-4 years.

As soon as we stopped and turned off the motorcycles we heard what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a stick.  We initially didn't think much of it as we were not familiar with the immediate area and assumed that there were people near by.  Two of us walked closer to the intersection to see if there were other motorcycles or vehicles parked down the road. We found none.  After several minutes, hearing no other sounds, I picked up a stick and hit a tree two times.  Within three seconds we heard two or three very loud tree knocks.  At this time we got on our motorcycles and left the area immediately.  The next day two of us returned to the same location to see if we could find a trail or a campsite in the area where we heard the knocking.

Adams,Cougar,503,"My girlfriend and I had been walking midday, 230-330ish, when we decided to walk down an overgrown old logging road. About a half mile down the road a meadow opened up on the left hand side and we decided to start walking through it. I had kind of started getting a bad feeling but attributed it to the fact that we were walking through an area that looked nice for a bear to take a nap, and we had heard bears were nearby. I asked if we could continue walking. Maybe another 75-100 feet walking through the meadow parallel with the road she had asked if she could practice her bigfoot calls, sure I thought, midday, perfect to practice. She had let off 3 quick calls and we waited for maybe a minute before we kept walking. Then she came upon the ants. These ants were having a war, but I was too busy thinking of that bear I might run into and wanted to keep walking. But instead took the opportunity to just look. Just look at my surroundings. I was staring off into the treeline for a minute or two, when through the trees I saw something big and fast move from my left to right without making any noise. In that short amount of time, I am fairly certain that I had seen a hand. But it was mostly the texture of the hair that struck me. Very straggly, knotted, long but not being picked up away from the body as it ran. I tried to keep my eyes on it but it disappeared as quick as I saw it, before I saw another flash of it through the trees only this time looking bigger in width. After that I didn't see it again. I radioed to our main camp to let them know what I had seen. And we sat down. Just looking into the woods, trying to listen for anything. When a deer walked down the meadow from the direction we had come from, stopped maybe 20-30feet from us before it took off screaming. Some more of our fellow campers arrived and we went a little further into the woods. I did not see anything else the rest of that day.","Just the deer. We had made noise, I don't believe he was unaware of us, and for the deer to walk up that close on us and then get spooked at take of running and screaming towards the woods was bizzarre.","The one person that was with me at the time, was looking at ants.

We heard the vocalizations again at about 11:00 pm Saturday night and this went on for about 45 minutes, then again at about 4:30 am for about 10 minutes.

I had some stacked up in a box. To the north and behind my house, the neighbors dog was barking like crazy from inside their fenced off back yard... There's thick barrier of brush between me and the next lot facing west so I couldn't really see the dog. I grabbed the two small pots and stood up and yelled at the dog to ""shut up"" just then the bushes in front of me started thrashing like crazy and deep growl/grunt/exhale emanated from behind them. It was surreal as sound seemed to penetrate right through me, whatever it was, it wasn't happy.   Instinctively, I started to cover the distance to my shed about 35 feet and while I was on my way, I could feel/hear the ground pounding as ""whatever"" was moving for cover in the brush to the south. It was like ""boom, boom, boom, boom then it crashed into the woods and there was loud sound of sticks/branches breaking... I ducked to the shed and just stood there, confused as to what just happened. I waited for what seemed to be a few minutes, grabbed a sledge hammer for some protection and was just about to make a break for the house, when the bushes and branches behind the shed started snapping, again; it was like a buffalo was charging through them... So, I stayed put and I was getting kind of freaked out. Then there was silence for a few minutes and I made the dash for the house. Once inside I grabbed my Mossberg 500 loaded with ""00"" buckshot and headed back out on my back deck. There was nothing to see and even the dog was quiet... I thought about looking for tracks but, I reasoned it out that whatever could make the ground shake like that would be best left alone. I'm a cautious person by nature.

My son and were planning to spend 2 nights and daughter and her son, just for the day. We set up camp, ate lunch and just enjoyed the day at the lake and surrounding area. Many hunters were leaving due to it being the last day of Bow season for Elk so we watched them being packed out by Mules and Horses.  Beautiful day in the low 80's I would say. My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp. At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn't bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring.  September 15 Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob's side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon. When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents. By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn't believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn't want whatever it was to know I wasn't sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out ""Go Away"" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left.

Rainer. We parked at a forest service gate and walked in about 1 and a half miles to our spot, Where we have been many times before, its all old growth timber and really thick with old stumps and moss and what not, anyway, when we walked in my wife thought she heard an ax or something pounding on a tree. She said did you hear that? I was excited and finding mushrooms so I blew it off, and said come and pick this patch. An hour or so had passed, when I heard snapping and crunching about 100 yards away or so. And then we both heard thump thump thumping of what we concluded was a big rock pounding against a tree, now mind you, we are in the middle of pretty much nowhere, not a sole around. My wife and I stood in awe, and she said that sounds like wood knocks. My heart sunk as I watch a lot of bigfoot documentaries. I am an avid hunter and no all the sounds a forest or animal makes. Three minutes or so had passed from the tree pounding and crunching when all of a sudden SNAP, a tree or big branch we estimated around 5 or 6 inch in diameter snapped 20 feet behind us. We both jumped.as it was so loud and close.at that moment we ran. I said lets go, heck with the the mushrooms, as we were running past a lot. It was the scariest most unsurreal thing that's ever happened to me. 42 years in the woods and I never. I do not like to tell this story to my friends and stuff.as they laugh.

As I started back up in the direction of the car I heard 2 loud wacks of wood on wood about 6 or 7 seconds apart and about 300 feet above and to the right of me.  Thought maybe hunters but had seen no signs of campers, no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports.  Reached my car and got the camera battery and was ready to hike back out when I noticed that at the opposite end of the berm about 10 feet from where I had crossed earlier that some thing had crossed it and had slipped. I got a little excited thinking maybe a deer and a possible good track. What I found set me back a bit and had me starring for a bit. I have been all over the Cascades, Olympics and have been from Compo to Monument 78 on the Pacific Crest trail four times. Have heard a lot of strange and different sounds and have later been able to say bird, Wolf,Cougar, Bear, Elk, etc. This I don't know. If it was human, as an Investigator and Fugitive recovery agent it would not be someone I would take down. If it is an animal, it is one I have never seen or seen tracks of personally.  After several moments the Investigator in me kicked in and I photographed the prints I found and cast the one that appeared the best defined. Not sure how the cast will turn out being on a slope and not having any ring to assist in the casting. While the cast set up I searched about for other tracks but the ground was very firm everywhere except around that berm. Collected the cast after 45 Min's and decided I would try to look for my tracks elsewhere. I know that it was hunting season, but had seen no one camping heard no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports from hunters that morning or for the rest of the day in that area.","Yes, for the first time in my life I had for a moment this urge to jump in my car and get out of there, real fear and having been face to face with cougar and Bear as well as being shot at I have no fear.

Sep. 6, 2014. We were in a little cirque just down the trail from Lake Ann. From the bluff high above us (to our northwest) to a crag on the other side of the highway (to our east), there was a weird vocal exchange going on for 5-10 minutes. It weren't no bird. It wasn't a wolf howl... I'm trying to recall. It was rather high pitched, but it also varied... there were a variety of sounds. Two bear had been sighted up the trail at Lake Ann itself, but we didn't see them.  We ran into two other hikers just after the exchange. They had also heard it and thought it strange. I just don't think it could have been human. For one thing, the points from which the exchange took place were so inaccessible, not good campsites. It was starting to rain. Night was falling soon.

(Investigator) First report:  Growl/howl heard today 16 Nov 2014 while hunting outside Winlock Washington at 2:42pm.  While hunting, I heard yelling mixed with a growl/scream within 200 yards of my hunting location. This is the same area three of us heard the same thing in November 2012. This time, within minutes, I was upwind from the screams, then I recorded the sound of trees breaking and the sound of foot steps ""Pounding"" the ground.

Went back out to look for physical evidence of my first encounter. What happened next spooked me very bad, making me somewhat sick to my stomach. As I follow a wide trail into the thick tree growth, I heard noise to my right, some distance below me. I stopped, listened, and began to pull my digital recorder out while holding my digital video camera. I never got the chance to turn on either. Within seconds, to my right I watched the top of the pine trees (15-20 feet tall) shake violently. Followed by the loudest, harshest scream I NEVER want to hear EVER again.

My dog and I were both staring quietly for about 10 minutes and heard nothing else.  After hearing the sound I used my flashlight to search 180 degrees in the direction of the sound.  My dog was with me, he has a strong prey drive though he obeys very well, he heard it and did not move a muscle only stared in the exact direction that the sound came from.

After being on-site without artificial illumination for over an hour, at 1 AM we still could not see our hands, legs, etc. If/when we observed/heard anything interesting we would signify that observation to the remote FLIR observation post by playing the song Jingle Bells on the harmonica.  That song was only to be played when some form of contact was made.  The two of us positioned ourselves roughly facing each other to facilitate a 360 degree field of view.  We talked about our plans for the upcoming hunting season, recapped some past events, joked, laughed and played various little ditties on our harmonicas. At approximately 1:00 am we heard the sound of a stick breaking a short distance directly behind my partner.  This was followed a few minutes later by two or three soft knocks, believed to coming from the same direction.  Approximately 20  30 minutes later my partner advised to look behind me. I initially turned to the right (saw nothing) then to the left and when tightly twisted around in my chair saw what appeared to be a floating red ball (with a slight tinge of orange).  The ball appeared to be in close proximity to the forest floor as it illuminated the ground in front (fan shaped pattern) with enough light to silhouette some ferns (estimated distance of ground illumination at 14-16 inches).  The ball moved slightly to the left and right and up and down (somewhat akin to a sniffing motion) then we saw what appeared to be a large index finger, again silhouetted by the light emanating from the source..  My partner started playing Jingle Bells (with some vigor) and I attempted to talk to the red ball in reassuring/comforting tones.  My partner made it about half way through another song (neither of us can recall which one) before the red ball gradually dimmed and went out.  We also observed what appeared to be the finger tip, and the first and second knuckles.  The finger moved slowly in our direction and toward the forest floor prior to the light source fading out.   The two of us remained in the dark and marveled at whatever it was that we had just experienced and wished that the two men in the remote outpost had either been with us to see same or had some form of experience on their own.  We started playing more songs on the harmonica followed by a minute or two of silence, followed by some casual conversation followed by another tune.

The next morning, Sat. June 14, 2014, we decided to drive up Baker Lake Rd. to look at the other campgrounds. We pulled into the Swift creek campground (formerly Baker Lake Resort) and paid for space 34. We parked our truck in our campsite and then took a walk above the lake shore. We came to an area that had a picnic table above the lake shore. Over to the right of us were a few people swimming in the swimming area. I sat on top of the picnic table with my feet on the bench (my son was over to the left of me, taking close up pictures of some flowers on the ground) and I was looking across Baker Lake to the other side of the lake with my binoculars. I was looking at the tree line near the shore directly across from me from left to right. Something caught my eye near a tree. It looked like a head next to one of the trees. I didn't see the whole part of a body going all the way down to the ground. I saw only the upper area of a body near the head and it seemed to be peaking out from the left side of the tree. My first thought was, it is watching the people over to the right of me swimming. I watched it for a few minutes trying to figure out if it was part of the tree, or a head with a face. I watched through my binoculars for a few minutes and sometimes would look from left to right of it and then back at it again. For a few minutes I kept seeing this head next to the tree and then I looked away and then back at it, and it was gone. That's when I realized that it was a head because it disappeared. If it was part of the tree, it would still be there. I told my son that I thought I saw a head near a tree and he didn't pay much attention to what I had said. He kept taking pictures of flowers. I can't definitely say it was a Bigfoot because I only saw a head, but a human would probably not be across the lake peaking out from the side of a tree. This didn't look like a human head. I have always had an interest in Bigfoot and I do believe they exist. Up until now I haven't seen one.

A friend and I were camping on Mica Peak in Spokane County WA.  We decided to go for a quick hike just before dark.  We were walking an old logging road.  As we came around a right hand bend, we saw the outline of a man standing next to a small pine tree. The tree was only about 12 feet or so tall and Christmas tree shaped, but fairly sparse branches.  The ""man"" was standing to our right of the tree.  It was around 30 yards from us.  At this point it was getting too dark to make out much detail of the thing, but it was about 4 feet shorter than the tree, dark and wide.  The tree wasn't moving, but the ""man"" was swaying slowly from side to side.  We backed up slowly till we were around the corner out of sight before we turned and got back to camp as fast as we could to start a fire.  We were camped near a creek in a valley.  That night after sitting by the fire talking and playing guitars we went to bed.  While laying in the tent just about asleep, from back up near the logging road we had hiked, we heard screaching.

I wanted to find a place to shoot that was off the road and away from any trails, the river, or possible campers. Found a spot that didnt have a car for more than a mile each way. Pulled over and loaded up about 10 magazines. Spent about 15 minutes getting everything ready on the tailgate of my truck. Heard absolutely nothing but birds chirping.  I hiked down a ravine to the left of the road about 150 yards and shot off some rounds for about 15 minutes. Finished up and walked back up to the car where my girlfriend had been waiting. As soon as I came out of the ravine and onto the road we both heard a LOUD cracking / snap noise from the top of the wooded hill that was to the right of the road, the opposite side of where I had been shooting.  We both looked at each other wondering what it was, our jaws dropped. It wasnt a tree breaking because we didnt hear anything hit the ground. There was also no wind less a sporadic slight breeze. We heard the noise approximately 6-7 times and there was about 30 seconds between each one. It was very loud and very, very close. The time between each one was also very consistent. My girlfriend and I both said that we could hear it coming form the top of the hill maybe 100 yards from the truck. We could also hear something moving around. Not twigs and branches snapping but it sounded like bark rounds being stepped on and ripping. A strange noise, it actually sounded like something ripping bark from a tree too.  I grabbed my cell phone and walked up the hill to where the sound was coming from. Filmed about ten minutes. I was filming up and to the right of the hill for a good 6 minutes. As soon as I walked a little closer to the top of the hill and started filming to my left another cracking sound rings out, startled the hell out of me because it was so close. The camera actually shakes when the noise starts from me reacting. This was just about seven minutes into filming. I heard the sound of bark or something again, like it was peeling off a tree. I couldnt help but think that the sound was coming from up in a tree. I got it on my phone and you can hear how loud it was, and how close. I would guess whatever was making the noise was about 50 yards away.   Returned to the car and left. I thought it was very strange that this noise didnt start until after I made all the noise shooting. When I made it to the area where the noise originated I could see my truck. Its like whatever made the noise waited until it saw me get back on the road. The noise it made was so loud I am perplexed as to what it was. It sounded like a large branch being hit on a tree and snapping. I cant think of any animal that makes any noise that loud. Ive spent countless hours in the backcountry and camping and have never heard anything like it.   As much as I wanted to climb the next 50 yards to the very top of the hill I couldnt bring myself to do it.

We started out exploring many of the roads in the area, and as we travelled down one road we encountered a tree that had fallen across the road but was lodged in the trees tops on the other side of the road. We were able to drive under it after we determined that it seemed safe from falling and blocking us in. We drove a short distance further and went through a sharp right turn and found another tree across the road the same way. So we decided to back up a few feet and take a smaller side road and turn around. Once we were on the side road we decide it may be a good road to check out, however we wanted to walk up the road to make sure we could turn around, or see if we could tell how far up it went. The road was smaller than the previous we were on, and neither of us had any previous knowledge of this area.  	After we got out of the jeep we walked about ten feet and heard a few quick knocks which sounded like a big stick hitting a tree, almost like someone knocking on a door. We continued walking and while talking about the noise, we then became distracted by some old broken equipment that was left by the loggers. We thought it was odd that it was left because it had some scap metal value. At that time we again heard the knock behind us, and on the same side of the road as before. At that point I took a couple of pictures toward the noise, but while looking at the display screen on the camera I was using (Canon PowerShot A720 IS) I did not see anything. As our attention was focused on that area and we moved closer, we heard another sound to the left of us also on the same side of the road. It was a massive snap that sounded like at least a 6 inch thick log breaking. It was not just a quick snap, we could hear the log snapping in sections like when you cut down a tree. At that point we decided that we needed to leave and walked back to the jeep trying not to look like we were fleeing. At that point we backtracked up the hill on the road we came in on and looked down on the area. But we could not see any people, car, or anything else that could have made the noise.

My dad and I crossed the river a little after nine and started to go West. We did a few tree knocks and nothing was heard or seen. We decided to backtrack and go East for about half a mile. We kept doing tree knocks and still nothing. I began to feel an incredibly unsettling feeling, sort of like severe anxiety. I belted out a call, specifically a call thought to have come from child sasquatches. Around 7-10 seconds later I heard what sounded like a really heavy rock clunking against a tree. My dad and I became quite excited, so I tried a couple whoops and got nothing. We decided to call it a night and headed home at around ten pmish.","When we were in the area of the sighting, I had an unsettling feeling for about ten minutes surrounding the tree knock.",Me and my dad.

53065,4685,49664,2015,Summer,August,WA,Stevens County,Please call me for this information,Clayton,Whittier Rd,"My husband and I live in the back woods of Clayton, Washington. We were driving around our property which is the side of a large heavily wooded hill/mountain. We were trying to find a place to build our cabin. We drove to the top stopping about halfway to look over the edge of what we call the pixie stix. A bunch of trees that had been fallen by previous owners stacked on the side of the hill like pixie stix. We noticed something had been moving logs and stumps around. Probably a bear though we saw one stump out of place for a bear. It had been pulled straight up out of the ground tap root and all still intact. No sign of the rocking motion that a bear does to remove roots. No claw marks. So we looked around for bear tracks and really didn't find much. We went back to the truck and continued to the top of the hill removing trees and branches with the chainsaw to get through. When we got there we removed some more branches and scoped the area for our cabin all the while there was something staying just out of visual contact but walking around behind us on the neighbor lot. We left when we were done. We went back down the hill and started up another road that my husband had built with our dozer a few months earlier, as we started up the road which is not that long, I was startled when I was looking at a tree that I didn't remember was there and it turned and quickly moved out of sight to the left. I yelled at my husband asking him what that was? he said ""what?"" I asked him if he saw it, he said no. The branch about 8-9 ft above the ground was still moving rapidly from where the head, I assume it was the head, hit it (I saw that happen). He stopped next to where it was and we could not see anything. We continued up farther on the road and got out and I was talking to him and he said to hush. He had heard something about a minute or two later just as he literally started  to say ""ok I heard a ""woop"" just once. Again he was talking so I did not hear it. He wasn't believing that I saw something. So we looked around this area for another possible cabin site. After about 20 - 25 minutes we went back down to the bottom of the hill (home). That night we started hearing things. This time hubby heard it too. Later that evening when we went to bed and lights were out there was banging on the side of our cabin and then a short time later things were hitting our cabin. Not rocks really don't have any around so it had to be sticks. My husband is a believer now. He was scared. I'm nervous to go outside when I'm here by myself. The next day I did go out and look for footprints around our cabin and found a huge print behind our cabin but it was an older print. It looked like a huge flat footed huge toed person. I showed my husband and he started looking in the area and found another it looked about the same age. So my husband has been leaving food out for it but we don't know what is taking the food.  We think maybe due to the fires here in Washington they are on the move but we also have been hearing strange howl/growl sounds that are very loud for months. Our cat would always be in the same area as the sounds as if it was talking to our cat. Yesterday something went after my chickens and so there was a lot of commotion and then I kept hearing branches breaking and woop woop sounds.   What do we do?",It is all in the report,Just my husband and I,No. We don't want to tell our neighbors they will think we are nuts,The first incident was between 6 pm and 7:30 pm that night started around 9 or 10 pm the chicken incident was around 4 pm,Heavily forested pine trees and under brush on the side of a large hill.,"30, 31, 1"

It was about 8:15pm in late November 2014 so it was dark, chilly, and clear outside. I had just gotten home and walked up to my front door and was about to push my key into the lock when I heard, what I can only describe as, a hooting noise like Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot in rapid succession. I paused and turned around slowly and walked to the edge of my doorstep listening closer and it happened a second time Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot. Following the second vocalization, all of the dogs in town began barking and howling incessantly. The noises did not sound very close, but it was extremely loud and sounded like it carried over from the mountain just south of town.   I waited a little longer, but heard nothing more and so retreated to my apartment.  It sounded extremely ape-like and I have never heard anything like that before or since. The closest resemblance to those noises that I can find are in vocalization clips found on The Gorilla Foundation website www.Koko.org/vocalizations, only the vocalizations I heard had more scream to them and were much louder and very powerful. The sound went right through you and came from something with a huge chest. This was no coyote, elk, owl or otherwise, none of those can make a vocal this powerful. No one else was around at the time. ",None,No other witnesses,"Not from locals, just on BFRO","8:15pm.

I told him to go back to bed because he was dreaming. within minutes I heard the whispering as well. I grabbed a flashlight and left my bedroom which is on the second floor of my house. My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The ""whispering"" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard.

We were heading through an area where a small spring crossed under the old road. The forest was very dense on one side of the road and clear cut 30+ years prior on the other side so there was alot of brush, but still quite open. Just then about 50 ft into the dense thicket above us we hear a very loud breathy yell followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree. We were so close that we could feel the percussion in our chests from its yell, and the knocks echoed for miles. We both checked to make sure that our rifles were loaded not knowing what the noise was we make our way back to our spots we had chosen to sit until dark.

53047,4735,50659,1970,Fall,October,WA,Okanogan County," Moses Mountain, Moses Meadows, Omak Washington, Okanogan County ",Omak,HWY 155,"Ok, My great great uncle owned a ranch (long story) on the Colville Indian Reservation in Okanogan County just outside of Omak Washington. Our family would buy beef from my uncle on a yearly basis since I was a year old so I knew the ranch and the acreage pretty well. The ranch has since been sold and is dilapidated, but there are people living there. The ranch is located just west of Moses Mountain and incorporates Moses Meadows as part of the ranch. My first encounter of which I had no idea what I had seen was when my brother and I were at the ""log playhouse"", just east of the main ranch house. While we were acting like cowboys, I was at the west side of the log playhouse, and seen what I thought was a bear, just the back mind you, going over a slight ridge in the road, which, I believe was about 50 yards away, I yelled bear and we both took of to the ranch house located about 50 yards to the west. We both told our great uncle about what we had seen. Well my uncle went to investigate, when he came back he spoke to my uncle and my uncle and him went to see what he had seen. When they both returned they ""privately"" spoke in the meat cutting room of the ranch house, after which my great uncle suggested we stay inside for the evening and play games or whatever, he didn't even allow me or my brother to go with him to feed cattle that evening like we always did with him. Later the next year I had heard through my mom and dad that my uncle had seen some huge ""foot prints"" by the road when he investigated my bear sighting. Remember I have been riding horse, fishing and exploring this ranch for nearly 14 years by this time. When I was old enough (15 years old) I had asked my great uncle if I could work there for the summer, (1977) since I was of age at that time for ranch work he was more than welcoming. At the time he had 2 other hands there besides me. One time I, and another ranch hand, went up Moses mountain when my great uncle and aunt went to a party or something and wanted to get some rabbits or grouse we had been traveling for a bit when the ranch hand shot a huge rabbit, we gathered it in his truck and proceeded up Moses Mountain, he then shot a grouse on the left side of the road at that moment I caught a glimpse of the back of what I thought was a bear out of the right, at the same time he looked over at me after shooting the grouse and his eyes widened like a guy being electrocuted, mind you this is a 2 lane dirt road uphill, he turned that old willys around in short order and hauled ass, and I kept asking WTF what are you doing?. When my great uncle and aunt returned he told them what he had seen and my great uncle was very inquisitive on what he had seen and where he had seen it. I was in AWE, We all headed up to Moses Mountain, my great uncle insisted everyone stay in the truck when we arrived where the ranch hand said he saw something. After my great uncle searched the area (rifle in hand) he asked that anyone who needed to go outside, in daylight or dark to take someone with them, then we all headed back to the ranch.I need to bounce back a bit in time, my great uncle was a great coyote caller, he could call them in to 30 feet of where he was standing, back when I was a boy (5 years to 14 years old) he would call them off the porch of the ranch house, and then you could hear them from Moses Meadows, they would get closer, he would howl, and they would get closer yet. As I am telling this memory other things come to mind so bear with me. One time in particular my uncle did his howling (1973 or so) and a low tone howl, followed by a sort of sharp type up ooooooppppp followed, my dad said jokingly, "" sounds like a coyote with a calf in its mouth"", my uncle then grabbed a rifle and headed to Moses Meadows, about a mile away, he said he was going alone! no shots were fired and my great uncle came back to the ranch house. October 1974 I will never forget this, my great uncle is doing coyote calls from the front porch, my dad, brother, mom and aunt are laughing at the variety of calls being made back to my uncle. When all of a sudden a very loud and definitive type howl comes from the back of the ranch house, definitely not coyotes, followed by 3 huge grunts, the fence is 100 feet from the back of the ranch house, not much of a fence, but that was my judgement of distance. My great uncles eyes went totally wide and white, then both my aunt and great uncle said they would like us inside. 1977, summer, July. So I began working on my great uncles ranch, we all went to Bill's Hill directly behind the ranch to fix fence, at about noon that day, just after lunch while I was pounding in a fence post I looked up to ask my great uncle a question and I seen 2 trees, pine trees, that were at least 20 feet tall sway, I was looking I believe east and he west, the trees were 20 feet inside the fence line to the south, at the same time my uncle had evidently seen the swaying trees and came directly to me and stopped. Once there he said, ""you have to ranch with them, and live with them, they mean no harm, just leave when they ask and come back and finish your work"", at that time we both heard a uuggh ugghh (loud, like someone yelling), the tree to the right of the fence line moved a lot, 20 foot tree bent or swayed nearly 75 degrees, then crashing through the woods, you could actually see where an animal was moving, a large animal, these trees and the brush on Bills Hill at the time were very close, and the brush was very dense, I challenge anyone to copy that. I think my great uncle knew, hope he did!!. I aint lying County",,,,see what I wrote,,
53053,4736,50678,1997,Summer,June,WA,Pierce County,FT. Lewis,Ft. Lewis Washington,,While serving in the Marine Corps I was stationed at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on the USS Carl Vinson. We went to Ft. Lewis Washington to conduct some day and night patrols. I remember the exact day because we listened to the Mike Tyson fight on the radio earlier in the day while in the field where he bit off Holyfields ear. While at Ft. Lewis during a night patrol we got off of the path we were supposed to be on and ended up in some deep brush that was thick and hard to get through. I was the point man on the patrol and carrying a SAW which is a fully automatic machine gun and it was loaded with blanks. While busting through the brush I encountered something that was very big and shaped like you would think bigfoot would be shaped but only saw it in the dark with no lights except for the moon. This large thing and myself were within probably ten feet of each other and it scared us so badly that I opened fire on it with the SAW and the blank rounds to run it off. It ran through the brush on two legs taking huge steps each time and busted through the brush like it was nothing and disappeared over the hill in seconds. Ever since this day I have always known that it was a bigfoot that I saw that day. This was in 1997 before computers and google so I had heard rumors afterwards that Washington was a hot spot for bigfoots. I never knew until now when I ran into this website that there is more sightings of bigfoot in that area than anywhere else in the US. I googled to see what county Ft. Lewis was in and was very surprised when reading through the stories from that county that there was several other sightings on the base such as mine. I don't tell many people this story unless they talk about bigfoot first because as you know most people who have not encountered something like this themselves will not believe you anyways. ,,Several but unknown now who they were,just on this website,Some time during the dark of night under moon light.

We have herd about some weird things and encounters up there so we decided that we were gonna go see what was out there. I can't say I was expecting anything to happen but I was open to the idea of it. As we were driving up, we pulled off and were walking around on a game trail. I located an interesting footprint. I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving. As we walked down this road, we kept hearing movement along the way. We had the feeling that we were being watched. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us. We were very worried and my friend shot 3 warning shots into the air. We started speed walking back and continued to hear movement in the trees. We got back to the truck and got out of there. When we got almost back to pavement, we pulled off and just relaxed. It was night by this time and we were all in the truck.  After a few minutes we started hearing movement again in the bushes. We stayed aware but didn't overreact like before. After about 6 minutes, something hit the truck. We flipped on out light bar and got out to see what it was. There was nothing around the truck that could've hit it except for a nearby stick. My friend threw the stick back in the woods and we all got back in the truck.  It was about 5 minutes later in the same location when something hit the truck again. Like before we turned the light on and got out. We looked around for the object and it turned out to be the exact same stick. This is when things got weird because he threw the stick back in the woods and got back inside. Then it happened again and as we're outside, we threw the same stick back and we were still looking around as we continued to hear movement. Then as we were still outside, I saw the same stick fly out of nearby bushes and hit the hood of the truck. That's when we knew that we had to leave. This had all of us very upset and honestly frightened for our lives. At first I was open to the idea of a ""Bigfoot"" but after this night, I was convinced.

We had just finished eating a steak and baked potato dinner around the campfire and were talking when we heard a loud ""bang"" sound that sounded similar to when you set a large round log on top of another for splitting.  It was only estimated to be about 50-60 yards away and very loud.  We are all experienced woodsmen and the noise was enough for all of us to grab our spotlights and guns and face that direction as we had never heard anything like that before.  After about 5 minutes we sat back down and were discussing the sound when it happened again just as loud.  At this point we discussed all three sleeping in the truck to be safe that night.

I thought what or who is that, I could see that it was very tall over 8feet and it had dark hair the head was smaller than the shoulders but it had no neck. When we made what I want to say is eye contact it took a step back and got parallel with the tree so I couldn't see him but I knew that he was there.

My husband and I were snowshoeing out from my parents property towards Antoine Peak conservation area around 12:30 pm. We had gone for about 45 minutes away from the house, seeing lots of wildlife along the trails including deer, rabbit and moose. There were lots of tracks along the way as well. We came upon a trail where all of a sudden the deer trails we had been following, swerved off the main trail and up the hillside. Up ahead was a single set of tracks that appeared to be a bi-pedal animal of some kind and there the smell was something awful.   We weren't sure what to make of the tracks at first so we just continued along the trail. I immediately noticed how far apart the tracks were and became very aware of what we COULD have been looking at. I had my husband try to  match his stride to those of the tracks, and he came up  VERY short.   We didn't  come prepared with tape measures or anything like that, but my Husband is 5'9"" and he could only get to about half of the stride length.  We  continued to follow the trail of tracks for several hundred feet and they suddenly turned and,  what looked like, jumped off the side of the hill towards a clearing where there is a pond in the summer months.  At the time there was about a foot of snow on the ground and the following day, another 6+ inches fell.

I was hunting elk with a muzzleloader. I jumped what I thought was a group of elk from a dense cedar seep thicket. Continuing north up a small canyon as it began to snow more  heavily. I heard what sounded like chimpanzees huffing. I've been a hunter in these mountains my whole life and have never heard anything like this in the woods. It became clear to me that there were 3 separate individuals communicating with each othe back and forth. Two on the left side of the canyon, which was my side and another on the right side. I tried to catch a glimpse of whatever was making the chimp huffing and chattering but was unable to see anything. The storm became worse and it was getting later in the day.

53019,4862,57244,2016,Spring,May,WA,Ferry County,Witness does not want to share exact location publicly.,Kettle Falls,Hwy 20,"Event:  My hunting partner and I arrived at our favorite camping/hunting spot, known to hold turkeys year after year.  Upon our arrival around 6:30PM, we noticed previous campers had left garbage, a cooler, and cooking utensils/pots/pans in a pile. Two logs, resting in small pine trees above the pile were cris-crossed in a ""teepee"" fashion above the garbage pile. We found this was unusual as many years in a row, this particular spot was always maintained - i.e. fire pit always cleaned/put out, no trash, barbed wire access gate always closed.      After driving for 6 hours to arrive there, we didnt put too much thought into it (other than being irritated that we were going to have to remove the trash left behind) as we were both tired from the drive, and wanted to set up camp.  My partner has a ¾ ton 4wd pickup with a camper on the back, which we didnt remove from the truck bed, but left on.  After getting the truck unloaded, and camp set up, we cut up some downed firewood, built a fire, ate some snacks, drank a single beer each while planning our strategy for the next mornings hunt, then retired to the camper for the night.  At 2:43 AM, we were both jolted awake by an extremely loud bang on the back door of the camper.  My immediate reaction was to ask my partner What the F*** was that?  His response was chambering a round into his pistol.  My first thought was I think someone threw a rock at the camper while looking out the side window  all I could make out was the silhouette of the trees, with a half moon and stars.  After approximately 10 seconds or so he had turned on all outside flood lights, and the interior lights and he opened the back door.  After finding/observing nothing outside (no rocks) I noticed that the side window blinds had fallen down and I suggested that possibly the noise we heard was the blinds falling down.  Although being jolted awake, we both thought that could be it, and drifted back asleep.  We both slept lightly (uneasily) the remainder of the night.  We awoke at approximately 5:00am, and hunted until about 8:00am or so and returned to our camp for something to eat and drink.  After having time to reflect on what had happened in the middle of the night we both agreed that whatever happened, the window blinds falling down was a by-product of the bang not the cause of the noise we heard. I cant even begin to describe how loud or forceful the bang/slam was.  We can even remember the door latch vibrating from the impact.  We began to attempt to recreate the noise by banging the sides of the camper and hitting the awning supports off the back of the camper, with no luck.  We could only attempt to recreate the sound and impact by slamming an open hand on the rear of the camper, but it still didnt quite do it justice.  No dents, scratches or marks of any kind could be found on the camper anywhere including the roof.  No activity the following night, and left Thursday AM.  Given the lack of any tracks in camp, the presence of a cooler (containing food, beer, energy drinks) garbage sacks with 2 empty beer bottles and food wrappers we thought we could eliminate bear activity as bears are opportunistic feeders  thinking the cooler or garbage would be easier access?  Noise from an animal milling around garbage/cooler vs. slamming the door of the camper?  In an area that holds multiple species of animals including whitetail deer, moose, black bear, cougar, coyotes, wolves, we just couldnt think of any animal that would have the ability to have done anything like that.  Not to mention the way in, as well as the day we stayed there was a conspicuous absence of turkey/animal activity or even sign/tracks.  Normally hunting our 5 mile square area, we see at least 10-20 deer per day, have seen bear (3 times in 6 years), have had a cougar encounter 300 yards from camp in previous year.  While not successful every year, we at least see and get responses from turkeysnot this year.  Woods were quiet unlike every year we have been there previously.  We considered the people aspect, but if you are approaching a camper during hunting season we thought the last thing you would want to do is announce your presence with the likelihood that the people inside had firearms (which we did).  If the intention was to steal then camp chairs, full cooler, generator, nice plastic totes should have been taken.  All the above detail is provided to confirm what my partner and I are thinking, which is why we are submitting to this site.  Our thought is that a single or perhaps group of Sasquatch are in the area, and were upset that we were in their hunting area and tried to make us leave by a heavy open handed slap on the back of the camper  to explain lack of dents/scratches etc?  Perhaps previous campers left in a hurry due to garbage/cooler/cooking utensils left behind?  I would be interested to talk to an investigator to provide additional details regarding this event.  I dont want to share the exact location in this report publicly, as it is a place that while probably well known to a few, it isnt to a lot, and would like to keep it that way. But might help an investigator better understand the area and help debunk or provide validation to our assumption.  Thank you",Unusual stick structure found upon arriving at location.  Belongings from previous campers left behind.  Gate which is normally (always) shut left wide open.  Suspicious lack of any bird/animal activity.  ,"Myself and my friend.  Sleeping.

53037,4871,57484,2017,Spring,May,WA,Kittitas County,Cooper Lake Washington ,Roslyn,NF-46,"Me and two other friends arrived at a campsite near Cooper Lake Washington we settled for a campsite that was a couple of miles away from the lake because we couldn't make it past the snow. As we pulled into the dirt road that brings you to the campsite there was a tree covering the road into the site so we moved the tree and proceeded down to the campsite. We found as we got there that the previous campers have left their gear and it seemed as though they were in a hurry but we didn't think much of it other than that they were rude and disrespectful for leaving garbage and stuff laying around. After we got camp set up and got a fire going it started to get dark and down about a hundred feet of elevation in a two hundred yards away we heard a noise that none of us had ever heard before sort of like a really rapid yodel or tongue trill. The girl I was with was immediately frightened and hid behind me and my other friend said guys don't get too freaked out it's either like a wolf or a coyote and we listened again as it covered that 200 yards distance in about two seconds. Became much louder and four or five times vocalized this yodel I almost couldn't answer it from fear, but I was able to let out a scream. After I screamed it became silent and then behind us something hit our truck, sounds kept happening around us and we started to try to see what it was. This noise was very loud and very close and quite obviously directed at us. After that we heard wood knocks through the night but no more Close Encounters as I stayed awake most of the night in fear with one hand on my knife and one hand on a flashlight. This was amazing and intense and absolutely true I was definitely skeptical about the existence of Bigfoot before this trip and now I have absolutely no doubt that they are real.",The previous campers obviously left in a hurry leaving their tent and garbage and firewood behind.

We were renting a cabin on Lake St. Claire near the Nisqually Indian Reservation.  One afternoon we decided to take the kayak out. We were on the lake for about an hour, it was dead quiet except the occasional bird or splash from a fish in the lake, when we heard this loud mournful yell that echoed all around us. My wife froze and looked at me and said ""What the hell was that?""  I was trying to make sense of it and it didn't sound like the howl of a dog. It sounded more human like a mid to upper range of a bass singer holding a long mournful note but more guttural at the end, and LOUD very LOUD. Like I said it echoed all around us so it was impossible to get a fix on direction. I told my wife I really didn't know, to wit she said ""Time to go back"" and we returned to the cabin.  When we got back to the cabin instead of going inside I turned on my phone hoping to catch it on video.  I would let the camera go for a minute then stop and then record for another minute. I hit pay dirt on the third try.  The recording is a little thrown off by the cabin inhabitant next to us trying to start a jetski or boat but it starts immediately after the engine is cut off again.

53031,4880,57781,2016,Winter,February,WA,Jefferson County,The sighting occurred approximately 6.7 miles east of Hwy 101 (according to Streets 'n Trips).,"Bogachiel, WA",The sighting occurred just east of NF-2999 on Upper Hoh Rd,"My name is Tim. My wife Nan and I live between Newberg and Wilsonville, OR. On February 24, 2016 we decided to take a couple of days off and drive up to the Olympic Peninsula. We drove up to Olympia, WA and took Hwy 101 route along the Hood Canal to through Port Angeles to Forks, where we stayed the night at the Forks Motel.  Early on the morning of February 25th (a Thursday) we drove south on Hwy 101 to Upper Hoh Road and east to the Hoh Rain Forest. It was a beautiful clear and dry day, which was unusual for February on the Peninsula. After an enjoyable walk through the Rain Forest we headed back west on Upper Hoh Road. There was very little traffic in either direction and we pretty much had the road to ourselves. Approximately halfway back to Hwy 101, where the road once again comes close to the Hoh River, we had just cleared a corner and were at the beginning of a straight stretch of road which I estimate to be about 1/4-mile long before there was a left-hand corner.  At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road. It appeared to be 7-8' tall and covered in dark hair. We both looked at each other in astonishment with that ""Did you see what I just saw?"" look on our faces. Without making comment of my own I asked Nan to describe what she had just seen, and her description was exactly the same as mine. When we got to that spot where we had seen the creature appear from the woods we stopped and examined the site. The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north. The trees were just as thick on the south side of the road, but we could tell that we were very close to the Hoh River. There was no trail whatsoever coming out of the woods or going into the woods on the south side of the road.  Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river. Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a ""Professional Skeptic"". Yes it most certainly could exist, especially here in the Pacific Northwest where there are still enormous tracts of land that are virtually unexplored, but I would prefer to see proof of it myself prior to confirmation.  I am now a confirmed believer, as is Nan. We never told anyone about it, and it wasn't until last night when we were watching a rerun of your show where you did an investigation in the Olympic Rainforest that we were reminded of the event. After the show we decided that I should send an email to you to apprise you of our sighting. ","We have visited the Hoh Rain Forest before, but usually in the summertime on weekends. We were both very surprised at how deserted both the Hoh Rain Forest and the road going to and coming back from the Rain Forest was. During the entire incident, and even when we stopped where the creature strode across the road, we saw no other vehicles or people. It was totally quiet!",My wife and I were the only two witnesses. I was driving and Nan was the passenger in the front seat of the car. She was also looking forward down the road at the time that the sighting occurred.,,"It was early afternoon; probably about 2pm.

The Jim Clark Dude Ranch is out of business.,Marblemount,North Cascades Highway,"This sighting happened on a summer vacation trip with my mother who is now deceased. The trip was July 1973 outside of Marblemount Washington State. We were staying at a camp called Jim Clarks Dude Ranch (no longer in business). The facility had cabins, and activities, one of which was horseback riding on their fenced in property; I dont recall how long the ride should have taken. We were assured the horses knew where to go so we would not get lost! I believe we left around in the morning, just my mother and I.  The surrounding woods and property consisted of Alders, Evergreens, local trees and lots of underbrush, berry brambles and a barbed wire fence which was 4 or 5 feet tall, 3 strands   It was a clear, sunny day, no clouds and no wind. I could hear the river and birds chirping. The horses were walking along the well-worn trail until we came around a small bend that followed the property line, and then the horses stopped, fast! We were questioning what the heck was going on as the horses would not respond to any of our urging them to go. One horse made a chortle sound and the other responded then stopped making any noise, looked to the left and stared off into the distance. The only sound you could hear was the river, there were no birds chirping anymore. Within a couple of seconds I heard a crack which sounded like a tree branch snapped and simultaneously the horses (still looking left) looked a bit right and through the underbrush I could see the back of a tall being (Bigfoot) that stepped out and  moved a tree aside to continue through the woods. All I saw was brownish reddish hair and the creature had its right hand on the tree then put its left hand up and moved another tree and then you could not see it anymore, it was gone. I saw the back of this creature which was at least 5 feet above the top wire of the fence!  The horses waited probably a minute but it felt longer and then they galloped all the way back to the barn.  Mr. Clark said that we got back fast and in a hurry, my mother just said yeah, she wanted to get to fishing. She would not talk about it, ever. I never forgot it and did not know what it was at that time!   ",I am not sure if the Sasquatch saw us but if he did he was not interested.

I was the last person to walk through the field as I approached the tree in the center of the field I heard noise from the west side of the field. I hid behind the tree and started scanning the wood line and made eye contact with what at the time I had no idea what it was. It stood at what I would guess anywhere between 7-10 ft. in length it was well concealed by the woods so I couldn't get a clear shot of the body however the fur was of a dark brown/black color. Soon my fight or flight kicked in and I ran over to where my friends were waiting for me.

There was a small stand of alder between me and the forest where I had collected my firewood and materials for my lean-to and bench. Before sun down I caught about seven cutthroat trout out of the pool next to my camp and pan fried them. Shortly after sunset I began to hear what I would describe as an axe handle being struck against a tree in the forest to my south. It would rap out three distinct strikes and then move through the forest and repeat striking at different trees. This went on about an hour and well into pitch black. The forest in that area is as rough as any in the Pacific Northwest and would be terribly dangerous for a man to attempt to navigate in the darkness. About 30 minutes after the end of the tree strikes, I had settled down and was just relaxing when a pine cone came bouncing through my campsite coming from the forest and stopping just short of the creek.

There is a marsh area next to the county road at the bottom of the private property. A dirt access road to the property meets the county road across from the marsh.,"Hunters, WA","Lessig road, a gravel county road","My husband and I owned 32 acres in rural Stevens county for almost 10 years. The property had been logged several times but still had a good but not dense, mix of Ponderosa, Larch and Doug fir. We camped there almost year round in a travel trailer while we were building a cabin. We dug and lined a large pond for irrigation which attracted lots of wildlife and had planted a small orchard and garden.  In 2013, I decided to camp for a few days by myself and work on our cabin and garden. It was mid-July and a very hot, dry summer. During the first two days as I walked the 50 yards or so to and from the trailer to the cabin, I felt like I was being watched but chalked it up to the wild animals or birds. The third day, I came out of the cabin to go make lunch and there was a hairy animal standing next to and somewhat leaning on the shed behind the trailer. I thought at first it was a person because it was on two legs and how it seemed to lean on the shed (like a human). It was hard to tell because the shed was in the shadows behind the trailer and the trailer. I yelled Hey! youre trespassing! This is private property!! The animal turned and ran a few steps, dropped to all fours and ran off behind the shed and disappeared. It could have been a black bear but it looked so human-like.  On the third day, after working all day in the cabin, I turned off the radio, closed the door and headed to the trailer to make dinner, eat and retire at about 10 p.m. We always carry guns when we are at our place and I put my rifle on the table when I went to bed. Because it was still hot, I left all the windows open in the trailer that night.  About 2 a.m., I was startled awake by a series of knocks on wood. There were four measured knocks, four different times coming from four different directions. The first set of four knocks sounded very close and could have been about 20 feet away from the trailer. It was a slow knock, knock, knock, knock. There was a pause of about 60-90 seconds before the next set of knocks, which sounded in the opposite direction of the first. It was much further away this time. I couldnt tell you how far. The third set of knocking was the same cadence but closer and again, from a different direction, maybe 200 yards away. The last set of knocking was the same as the others, from a fourth direction and possibly a 500 yards away. I was wide awake and my heart was pounding. My rifle was on the table and I was so scared I was paralyzed and could barely breathe, afraid I would be heard. I couldnt even move to get up and get to the table! I laid in bed listening for more noises but must have fallen asleep as the next thing I remember, sun was streaming through the windows, birds were singing and it was 6:30 in the morning!  The next day I went over to my nearest neighbor who had the next lot over and asked him if he had heard anything. He hadnt but suggested the neighbor down by the county road (a half mile away) might have been hammering. That neighbor hadnt been seen at his place for more than a month! Then, on August 21, 2017, my husband and I were in Baker City, Oregon to see the eclipse. A small fair was being held in the town park and we were wandering around looking at the crafts, food, etc. We came to a Bigfoot booth and I told the man about my story. He then played a recording he had made in the Cascades a few years back and there in his recording was my exact experience four years earlier! The same number of knocks, the same cadence and spacing.

Early this morning, probably about 2 am, several of the scouts and their parents were awoken by a series of what they described as whoops.  My wife described three whoops as being VERY close and a short time later, maybe a few minutes, another series of whoops farther away as if the animal was moving away. She said it was unnerving to the point that she wasn't going to leave the tent the rest of the night.  She described the sound as nothing she has ever heard before.

The incident occurred on the last night of our stay. We were packed and ready to leave around 3:30 am but stopped to sit for a minute on a screened-in porch to have a cup of coffee before we headed to the airport. As we sat down, I heard something that sounded like what I thought was a man loudly yodeling not too far off in the distance. I asked my partner if he thought it sounded like someone who had been drinking. The sound changed to a very loud call starting with a long whoop! followed by a long, anguished-sounding howl/cry (about 10 seconds long). For a second, I thought maybe someone was being harmed because the voice had a very human male quality to it, however it became quickly clear it was not human. After a minute or two, we heard a very similar whoop/howl/cry for the same length of time (approximately 10 seconds long) coming from a further distance away. My partner and I stood at the door listening to these calls go on for a couple of minutes, trying to determine what we were hearing. This was not a familiar sound to either of us. We closed the porch door to shut the sound out because we were both completely shaken by it. I didnt even want to go load our bags into the car. On our way out of town, we thought about calling the PD to see if they had any reports but because we had to get to the airport to catch our flight, we decided against it. Since arriving home, we have listened to many recordings of different animals to see if we could rule anything out, but we cannot find anything like what we heard. My partner and I both have experience living and recreating in wooded, natural areas and are accustomed to hearing coyotes, wolves, mountain lions, foxes, owls, elk, deer, etc. I lived for many years in Pierce County and consider myself very familiar with it.

By the time we got there the campground was full. We kept driving and stopped at the first logging road that had a suitably flat spot for camping (we sleep in the back of our SUV). It was a short dead end logging road in a recovering clear-cut. We set up camp and went to sleep.  Around 2:30 a.m. my wife awoke to our pet rabbit scrambling around in the driver's footwell. The rabbit had gotten down there and couldn't get back up. As my wife reached up there to rescue the bunny, she felt something firmly touch her leg. She described it as a firm press and then deliberate, downward motion. At first she was confused because we were inside the car, but then she remembered that we kept the sliding rear windows open slightly for ventilation. The spot where she was touched was pressed against that opening (we built a sleeping platform in our car that puts us near the level of the windows).   She heard nothing super obvious, but immediately afterward she thinks she heard a couple of extremely light footfalls.   We stayed mostly silent for about an hour, just listening for anything, but heard nothing else. I finally mustered the courage to peek out a window, but couldn't see anything.   The next morning we found very large, muddy fingerprints on our car, near where my wife was touched. We have pictures of these prints which we would be glad to submit. In the photos you can see where I tried to recreate the prints with my own fingers. I have medium sized hands and the prints are MUCH larger.   We looked around a bit taking note of things. On my wife's side of the car was only a fairly narrow strip of road, and after that was dry, crunchy grass and brush. Whatever touched her had to be able to walk along that narrow strip, otherwise we would have heard it in the dry brush. It also had to be tall enough to reach the window. We feel these factors probably rule out four-legged animals.  We considered the idea that a person could have been messing with us, but there are some issues with that which make us skeptical. First, we feel a person wouldn't have been so quiet. Second, we find it hard to believe someone trying to scare us would have simply touched her leg, left prints, and called it good. More than likely a person would have taken things farther than that. That would really be showing a lot of restraint for a prankster.  Last, the prints would have been a VERY large person. One who also though to get their hands muddy beforehand.

As soon as we took off our helmets we heard a loud howl/moan sound that lasted 8-10 seconds. We looked at each other in shock. Another howl followed about 8 seconds behind it and then we head a loud bang on a tree in the opposite direction.   It was like a super loud woodpecker just pecked once. A few seconds after we heard a large tree branch break in the direction of the howl and then heard a third howl. Two more loud wood pecker sounds then followed with about 5 seconds in between.   The scream seemed like it was from a mile away, but in the dense trees it was likely much closer. The wood noises and loud break sounded like they were within 50 yards or so.   Then it was silent for about 5 minutes and we started to get ready to leave and the howls started again, but seemed like they were twice as far away.

I was up looking for oyster mushrooms in the hills west of Baker Lake Rd by Grandy Creek.  I have had several experiences in the fall time over several years.  Anyway, as I was walking in on a wooded hillside and happened to look down and saw an impression in a mossy patch that looked like an old sasquatch track. The ground is not good for impressions except for the mossy patches.  It measured 15 inches long. It was broad at the toes, and had a wide heel,  There was even a rise, in the middle of the track, as if  from a mid-tarsal break. It may not be a track, it may be a track. If a track, it had been there for some time, as it had small debris sitting in it.    I was up there this fall,and the possible track was still in the same condition so it should still be able to located.  BTW I got a good haul of oyster mushrooms that day.   I have heard deep rhythmic grunts, followed by a tree shaking in the creek bottom. My dad and I heard this breathing that was loud and angry sounding.

Sometime after it got dark and we were sitting outside talking when all of a sudden we heard multiple (around 3-4) wood knocks. We knew it was too much of a low hard sound to be a woodpecker. A minute or less later we heard from behind us two distinct knocks. This happened for a few more times.   We silently would point into the direction we heard it coming from as it went on for about 4-5 minutes. I finally had enough of it and started yelling the only thing I knew in the woods. Hey Bear!  My wife tries to hush me so that it could come closer. I demanded no and kept yelling.

53027,5010,62714,2018,Fall,November,WA,Grays Harbor County,,Humtulips ,Donkey Creek Rd,"November elk hunting in the Colonel Bob Wilderness in the Olympic National Forest. First day of modern elk season, high above the Humtulips River area. As I was setting up my truck tent for the night on a remote spur road I heard what I believed to be elk movement in the gulley/ravine below me. The area is a good elk hunting location and I have had success there in the past. It was too dark at the point to pursue any bull so I decided to make a cup of coffee, fire up my lantern and do a little reading before crawling into my truck tent for the night.   It was a few minutes after I sat down that I heard a tree in the high timber above me being moved. It sounded like it was being pushed or shoved until it crashed to the forest floor. I am familiar with timber and have spent my entire life running chainsaws and around logging. The tree was large and there was no wind or weather. So I rationalized it as just a weakened tree in the forest that possibly a bear or other large mammal just happened to rub against until it came down. But what happened next unnerved me unlike anything I have ever experienced. About five minutes after the tree incident, I head extremely loud limbs breaking, like fir or hemlock limbs literally being snapped from a tree. The echo of this resonating through the deep timber and deep into the ravine below me. It seemed to be around 100-120 yards above me to my north. Then I heard the same thing in the ravine below me, and another smaller tree snapping and crashed. Then I heard a very odd sound. I have tried to describe it to my family and all I can compare it to is almost a primate like sound, and it echoed through the timber.  At this point I packed up and drove the 7.5 miles back out to the gravel forest service road. I have never been as unnerved as I was. I had the overwhelming sense of being surrounded, and could not rationalize what I had encountered. I have spent my entire life hunting and camping in the backcountry of Washington and Oregon. I am a big game hunter and hunt alone much of the time. I am familiar with big game in Washington. I have no explanation for what I heard. ",Went back following day,No,Always.

The area my boyfriend's cabin is at is near Caldwell Lake, WA.  The main thing I want to tell you was that Dec. 2018 we were snowmobiling during a very cold snowy day out Dry Canyon Road...very primitive area...a few people have cabins in the area and people hunt this area but we are about the only people snowmobiling this road.   As we ride our sleds we stop to take breaks and enjoy the beauty. We had stopped a few times, taken our helmets off to rest and enjoy the beauty. When we got to the big caves and stopped, my boyfriend said,""Listen"" and there it was...wood knocking. We would here it down the road a bit, up the mountain and then you would here a response from across the road where a creek flows and it is dense brush, maybe a hunting trail. We were sure it was not trees creaking from the weight of the snow...We had not heard this sound. I got really full of anxiety and wanted to leave so we did. I have been sort of scared since this and have quit looking.",Up the road in a flat forested area I became aware of 3 trees that did not look right. It looked like they were pushed together to form a point at the top. The beginning of me being observant of the bigfoot.I walked back in there to check it out while my boyfriend sat in his truck and did not see how they could have gotten this way. That was probably Sept. 2018. A deer scared me from across the road and I bolted out of the forest then winter came. It looks like the trees are not in the same shape now put we can't get the truck back in there to look at it yet till the road drys out.,Myself and my boyfriend. We were snowmobiling up Dry Canyon Road. He had a remote cabin in this area and we spend lots of time here. Very primitive area.,"I googled bigfoot in that area and found a few sightings at or near Sullivan Lake, WA. Two summers ago there was a bad fire lasting many days. I knew if bigfoot was there they would need to move away from that area, possibly near the Dry Canyon Road area or move on north towards Canada. That was one of the things that made me more aware. We have not seen sights at the cabin...just Dry Canyon Road...but...we have not been looking to hard. I am really sort of scared of what might be out there and don't want out good times in the forest ruined.","Snowing, cold, overcast...probably early afternoon","Heavily forested...mountain ridge, damp area, big, big rock caves. Lots of forest and small creek. Large pond up the road...ducks,beaver, deer and moose in the area.",
53015,5022,62996,2006,Summer,July,WA,Cowlitz County,,Cougar Washington,just going up to Mt St helens,"Hello .The year was 2006, July.  The time was eight thirty PM. We were driving back from Mt. St. Helens, Washington. It was a sunny day so we went to see the mountain that day. We were driving down the road along side the Toutle River which was to the right of the van. We were in my family van at the time. We been driving some time on the road. I had my RCA video camera fully charged ready to go. I was in the back seat of the Ford Areostar van and my daughter in the seat in front of me. She was about 8 years old then. When out of the corner of my eye I spotted a large brownish red gray ... what I thought was a bear at first, standing in the Toutle River up to its middle calf.   It had to be 9 feet tall. It was in the water about 5 feet from the bank. The sunlight was shining on this creature. It was massive in size stature and girth. You could see the arm muscles, back  dorsal muscles, leg muscles, buttock, and thigh muscles. It was facing back side to us. The head was the size of a five gallon bucket, massive. I was so shocked at what I was seeing. It was no bear at all. It had massive shoulders. You could see all the muscles through the dense hair. It was amazing .This was the elusive Sasquatch.   It looked like a giant massive hairy man with massive arms they were long. It had to be a male. It was looking down as though he was fishing or looking to find something to eat. I was so amazed at what I was seeing I said, ""Hey Meg look at that."" That is the name of my daughter. She saw it too. To this day she still remembers what she saw and believes it was a bigfoot.   I told my brother in law, he was driving my van at the time, to slow down and pull over, I want to video tape something real important. He said he did not believe me. He wanted to get back home. It pissed me off so bad. I WOULD OF HAD THE VIDEO OF THE Sasquatch! It was a once in a lifetime thing if your lucky to see one.   If you ever get a chance to see one you will never forget it. It's always in my mind. I painted a picture of it. It turned out well. This is a true story I stake my life on it. Hope to here back from you soon. Sorry about my spelling.

53077,5024,63077,2019,Summer,June,WA,Yakima County,Silver beach near Rimrock lake,Silver beach Washington ,Highway 12,Heard at least four howls in the morning between 4-5 am at silver beach camp grounds. The sounds were about a mile away but could here clearly in the morning. Thought was wild life or maybe a person. Then looked up a video on YouTube of people using a parabolic sound dish recording Sasquatch vocalizing sounds when I arrived back home. Was able to recognize the sounds from the video to what I had heard. It was a terrifying sound. The best way to describe it was a howl sound between a man and a ape.

53073,5048,63451,2017,Winter,January,WA,Whatcom County,Exact location has been kept confidential in order to protect the privacy of surrounding property owners.,"Everson, WA",Private,"I was living in Whatcom County 5 minutes from the small town of Everson, WA. I worked on a dairy farm out in Custer, WA. I had to be work at 6:00 AM to feed calves, however, I did my best to get there a half-hour early just in case a cow had a calf in the night so that I could tag it, Vac it, tube it and move it before the other calves woke up for their morning feed.   I got out of bed at 4 AM and got ready to go, ate a small breakfast, and left the house at 5:05 AM to head for the farm. As I started down my road I got a funny feeling. I came to a Stop sign and got ready to turn when I caught sight of movement in the headlights. At first I thought that a deer was preparing to jump over the blackberries and onto the road until I focused on what it was I was looking at.   The creature blinked and reached up its hand to grasp a limb of a tree. It was sickly skinny! Its elbow joints protruded, and I could see the clavicle bone and the shoulders had a dip between where the arm connected to the body. I could see a massive rib cage and a sickly sunken stomach on this animal. I could see the tops of this animals pelvic bone protruding. It had a very clear thigh gap. The sides of the head were sunken in on either side and the face was gaunt with high cheekbones. The animal leaned against the tree it was holding onto for support. I was shocked and scared, but I knew what I was seeing was real. So I tried to take in as much as I could. The animal didnt seem too keen on moving. He just stood there staring back at my car like deer in the headlights.   It was anywhere from 85 to 89 tall and about 3'6"" wide (I came back and measured a week later based on the tree branch it held on to). It was covered in dark medium length fur with patches of gray around the face and peppered throughout the body. Its head road low to the shoulders with very little neck showing, and its eyes glowed yellowish greenish white in the headlights. Its head had a high cranial ridge, making it look pin headed for lack of a better word. Its arms were very long with the fingers of the creature just above the knee. Its eyes were forward facing and quite round and deep set with a broad, protruding forehead. Its nose was flat, with a thin lipped slightly protruding mouth like a gorilla but not as angled with the mouth. Its face had deep set wrinkles.   Thinking back now I believe this poor animal didnt have the energy to run. He just stood there staring back at me. I finally decided to turn onto the road and head to work. As I hit the gas going towards this creature he startled and bared his teeth at me. I know from documentaries that when a monkey bares its teeth it is a sign of aggression.   The thing that struck me is that its mouth was missing a bottom canine and the rest of them were worn nearly flat. The other teeth were chipped with a few broken close to the gums and nearly gone. I hit the gas at that point because I was turning left and had to go right past this animal within about 10 to 15 feet of it.   The reason I didnt report this sooner was because I was worried how people would react, and also I wondered what this animal was doing there in the first place. After thinking it through, it hit me. There was a chicken farm in the area. I truly believe this Sasquatch was older and starving to death. It happened to be a really awful Winter, with the most snow that part of Washington had seen in 20 years, with several ice storms, and heavy snows and with temperatures plummeting into the low teens. I think it had come down from the foot hills into the town outskirts to try to snatch a few chickens as an easy meal. I think I surprised him, thinking that no humans would be out that early in the morning.   A week later I saw the chicken owner while I was walking my dog. I asked how their chickens were and they told me that the week before, they believed that a few coyotes had gotten in and had snatched two of their hens that were sleeping in the outdoor shelter.  There is a thick dense forest that goes on for miles straight up into the mountains. It is home to deer, black bear, coyotes, and the occasional mountain lion.  I was born and raised in Montana. I hunt and fish and I have seen a lot of animals both wild and domestic. I am also a huge animal lover and have watched countless documentaries on every animal you can think of. So believe me when I say that I know animals and what I saw was not cougar nor was it a bear. I have seen them both in the wild, in zoos, and on documentaries. I would not miss identifying a bear for what I saw.",The branch he was hanging onto was broken clean off. The branch was a good 10 feet off the ground.,Just me.,I learned later that Whatcom County is a protected wildlife area for bigfoot and other species. ,"5:08 AM it was cloudy, and moonless. We were due for another heavy snow that day.",Heavy mix species forest and moderate sub division a river is only a mile from the location,21
53015,5061,63748,1991,Fall,October,WA,Cowlitz County,"Under power lines near Lexington, WA.",Lexington,Off Westside highway,"When hunting Elk by Black powder near the Lexington area near Kelso, WA in October of 1991 my wife and I were parked off a  Lexington road and were walking up the 500kv type power lines about three of four ridges in when we stopped for a morning break to view and scout the open areas under the lines. The open areas are about sixty to eighty yards wide cleared from side to side,  About 100-150 or so yards ahead of us on the next ridge (the power towers were on ridge top to ridge top) we seen a bipedal figure come out of the tree line and just stand there frozen and stare out at the clearing not moving at all for what seemed to be three to four minutes. We were very perplexed as to what was going on and if it was a person not dressed in hunting orange. Most people dont remain still for that length of time. What was it doing?   All of a sudden it took off and graciously walked across the clearing of this hill top and to the other side very quickly with long strides and then lost into the other sides tree line.  After calming my wife down as she was real excited as to what we believed we had just seen, she almost yelling ""Terry its a bigfoot , its a bigfoot."" We very slowly proceeded down the hill side and up the other to see if we could find and tracks. When we got there it was very obvious that tracks were out of the question as the hill top was the old graveled road that had in the past been used to install the towers, a hard pack ground. But what we did see was on the west side that it had disappeared into, was covered in black berries about five feet high and an obvious path right through them up the hill side. Needless to say we did not proceed up that trail. The other side that it had come from no tracks were noticed also hard pack. My wife was very ready to leave the area and we did.  Observation: Color was a light almost oak colored not black from head to foot, from that distance it was hard to judge height but I would guess around seven feet maybe more. Time around 8am.

53059,5090,65464,2020,Spring,May,WA,Skamania County,"The summit of Silver Star Mountain that we hiked to via the Grouse Vista Trailhead. Coordinates: 45.747963, -122.238859. See environment section below for more details on the location.","Yacolt, WA",SR 4109 (we arrived via L-1200),"My girlfriend and I both had Friday off, 5/15/20, and decided to go do one of our favorite hikes up to Silver Star Mountain in Skamania County, Washington. We live in Portland and go up to that hike at least once or twice a year. We regard it as one of our favorite hikes in the area due to its proximity to home and its sheer beauty.  I was born in rural SW Missouri, and then spent my formative years growing up in Colorado. I am an avid outdoorsman and spend a large amount of time backpacking, hiking, camping, snowboarding and surfing in the wilderness (as well as my girlfriend). I went to school for/work in environmental science and have years of experience collecting data in nature, including animal tracking and navigation.  We left around noon and arrived at the Grouse Vista Trailhead and began our hike at 1PM. The hike is around 6.8 miles roundtrip and can be challenging on the way up due to the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the top of Silver Star Mountain. The trailhead was filled with cars, although most of the foot traffic we encountered was on the way up as others were headed down. We like to hike in the afternoon for this very reason. We are both active/fit and didnt stop on the way up except for once when nature called.  Near the top, we encountered some snow (as was expected), but not nearly as much as the year prior. We finished the hike and were at the top of Silver Star Mountain. It was overcast with patches of sunlight, but no wind or rain and was generally pleasant. During that time, we were alone on the craggy peak and only a handful of other people were on the ridge to the south. The mountain is surrounded by valleys carving through the landscape on all sides.  My girlfriend is in the medical field as was on call that day. She was digging through her backpack for her work phone to check voicemails (we had very limited service). I was rummaging through my pack for snacks. It was during this time that I heard the first series of very strange noises from the closest valley to the north. It was a distinct and loud whoooo-ooop whooo-ooop. The first whoooo segment of the noise was deep, with second ooop part having an extreme pitch change that I could not correlate to a known animal. I ask my girlfriend if she heard it, but she was preoccupied with her phone.  It was around this time that a couple of other hikers showed up with their dog. We wanted to sit out on the rocks overlooking the views, so we moved slightly further down the ridge from them to a rock outcrop and ate some snacks and took photos (I can provide these photos for reference). In between conversation, the noise happened again from the same spot in the valley to the north. It was about 15 minutes from the first one. It was loud and filled the entire valley, giving me the feeling that it was a rather large animal. My girlfriend heard it this time and we both looked at each other puzzled. The other hikers behind us were carrying on conversation and didnt seem to be paying attention to the noise, but their dog had kept going to the ridge and looking to the direction of the noise. We waited in silence to hear it again, but never did. We decided to head back down the trail.  About halfway back down, the trail passes beneath Pyramid Rock. We had always wanted to scramble this rock to see the views and felt energized that day to do so. Pyramid Rock is comprised of loose talus and can be dangerous to climb. We picked our line going up the north side of the rock, which was rather steep, and came to a shallow cave toward the top. It was probably 20 feet wide and 20 feet high, but maybe only 10 feet deep. There were remnants of a campfire here, as well as a 4-foot wall or blind made of stacked rock around the entrance. After making it to the top, we decided we were hungry so we high-tailed it back home.  Upon returning home, I decided to check BFRO for reports from Silver Star Mountain and found Reports #13115, #1652. These reports are from the exact area we were in. The photos included in Report #13115 were taken from the top of Silver Star Mountain where we were sitting and heard the noises.  I would also like to note that the first few seconds of the Berry-Morehead Whoops and Knocks audio here on BFRO are nearly identical to what we heard that day.",We had noted that there was far less snow this year than the previous year when we last hiked it (exactly one year prior). We did a quick scramble up Pyramid Rock on the way down to catch some views and found a shallow cave with a primitive campfire and blind made of stacked rock at the entrance.,Myself and my girlfriend both heard the sounds. We had just finished the hike to the top of Silver Star Mountain and were resting on a rocky outcrop overlooking the valleys to the east. We were eating some snacks and celebrating making it to the top.,"Prior to the hike, I had read the latest Skamania County report on BFRO (Report #65295) which is roughly 30 miles from Silver Star Mountain as the crow flies. It wasn't until we got home that I found the two reports (#13115, #1652) from Silver Star Mountain. The photos included in Report #13115 were taken from the top of Silver Star Mountain where we were sitting and heard the noises.","It was around 2:20-2:30PM according to the pictures I took at the top of the mountain. The weather was typical for the springtime in the Pacific Northwest. Overcast with patches of sunlight, fast moving/low hanging cloud coverage. We were unable to see Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams, Mt. Rainier, and Mt. Hood which are normally visible from the top of the hike in clear weather. There was no wind or precipitation.","Silver Star Scenic Area is undoubtedly gorgeous. Silver Star Mountain itself is a craggy inactive volcano with lots of loose/jagged rock and cliffs and is roughly 4,300 ft in elevation. There are trees below the mountain, but not on the mountain top itself. Flowers were starting to bloom and things were very green. Areas not vegetated with coniferous trees were mainly covered in grasses and boulder fields. There are streams and rivers flowing down from the mountain into all of the surrounding valleys. When you sit on top of the rocks and take in the views to the east, the next prominent ridgeline is Little Baldy Peak. There are valleys on either side (north and south) of this ridge that connect Silver Star Mountain and Little Baldy Peak. The north valley is where the sounds were heard. I can provide photos I took at that exact moment for context and would be happy to markup a map of where the sounds came from (roughly the headwaters of Star Creek).",15

53073,5098,65641,2018,Summer,August,WA,Whatcom County,[Near the confluence of Kenny Creek and the North Fork of Nooksack River],"Welcome, WA",North Fork Road,"My husbands parents, uncle and and three others bought a piece of river property in 1972.  It has been used continuously since then, mostly by Uncle.  We use it once in a while as does my SIL and her family and one other familys grandkids.  Although the road is right next to the property, the property sits about 30 below it in river bottom.  There is a creek at the north end of the property, about 200 feet from where our rig was parked.  That creek runs out to another creek that is part of the river and creates an island that used to be part of the property.  It is very secluded.  The summer of 2018, my sister-in-law and her (adult) kids had been camping out at the property on several occasions, cleaning out trees and undergrowth, as they had bought trailers and needed to do a bit of landscaping to get their rigs in there.  My husband had a load of crushed gravel taken out there in 2009 that we used to put in the fire pit area and bolster the ground as we had a trailer at the time and needed a place to set up camp without sinking into the mud up to our axels.  We had spent almost every weekend that summer out there.  There was still quite a mound left, so SIL used that gravel to cover the area (nobody had used that area of the property on a regular basis for about 9 years at that point).  She also made a sweet little walk-way from the fire pit to one of the camp spaces about 40 feet away.  On the weekend of August 18-19, 2018 we were camping at the property.  One of my step-sons was up visiting from Texas and my husband wanted to have a BBQ for him and our daughter-in-law with the family.  We took our motorhome out to the property on Saturday afternoon and met my SIL and BIL who had gone out the night before in their rig.    We stayed up talking til about 9:30PM.  Then right after dark I went into the m/h, my husband came in about 30 minutes later, his sister went into their trailer about the same time, then I heard our BIL go in about 10:15 PM.  I had a window open as it was a pretty warm night, and the shade up about 5 and their door was open, so I could hear (and see the flickering light) that he was watching a movie, as was I.  Our rigs were parked about 70 apart with a few scraggly, leggy plants and the large fire pit area between us, but otherwise an unimpeded view.     My husband had gone to bed at the back end of the M/H.  I sat up at the dinette until about 12:15am, finally deciding that I was sleepy enough to go to bed.  I closed and locked the window and the shade, made sure all the doors were locked, got into my jammys and got into bed.  My husband was sound asleep, as was our 6 month old Golden Retriever puppy.  Within 3 minutes my brain was settled enough to begin dozing off.  Suddenly  BangBangBang!!!    It sounded like 2 baseball bats being slammed together, about 3 seconds apart!  It seemed like it was coming from the rivers edge, or closer? 60 feet, 100 feet away.  I didnt know.  Pretty close!  My eyes flew Wide open staring into the pitch black room!!  I KNEW instantly what that was!!! 15 seconds went by nothing, so I was closing my eyes.  Then  BangBangBang!!!    It sounded like it came from up the creek, maybe a hundred yards.  I dont really know..  on the island?  Oh Sh.., there are Two of them!!  15 more seconds went by (yes!  I was counting!!  My Navy training kicking in)  BangBangBang!!!  The closer one again.  Another 15 seconds  BangBangBang!!!  Up the creek  My heart was pounding so hard, I was afraid that it might literally explode!!  Caught in the pitch black woods in my fiberglass box!!!  Are the doors lock?  Are the shades drawn?  Did I close all the windows?  Can they rip the doors open?!  Would they smash in the windows?!!!  Would the family find us dangling from tree branches tomorrow afternoon?  Did B hear it and shut their door?  It was so loud!  He must have heard it!!  I cant call him, we have no cell service down in this gawd-forsaken hole!!!    Next thing I knowits 8AM Sunday morning..  How the heck did that happen?!  After all that banging and fear I thought I would be awake all night!!  Nope, I fell right to sleep!!!  Strange thing for me to do in light of the fear and emotion running around in my little chicken brain!!!  I peaked out the windows..nothing.  Oh!  Theres my SIL sitting at the campfire.    I put on a pot of coffee and walked over to visit her for a few minutes.  I asked her if she heard any noises last night.  No, she didnt, but she sleeps like a log she said (so does her brother).  Well, that is strange.  I KNOW that happened before I fell asleep, I KNOW IT!  I had only been in bed a couple minutes.  I wasnt even asleep yet!  So, I headed back over to our rig to start breakfast.  And THERE IT WAS!!  MY PROOF!!  That I was not insane and hearing things!!    Half way between the fire pit and our door, right at the edge of the little gravel walkway was a lone footprint!!  About 15 long.  About 6 wide at the ball, the dirt was mounded at the metatarsal break and the heel was square.  I had seen that same foot 17 years before, out on the sandbar, when it was only about 4 long!!!  OMG!!!  I was thrilled to pieces!!  But freaked out at the same time!  I went to the rig, grabbed my cell phone and took 3 good pictures.  Im so glad I did too!  Later that afternoon, people started showing up and I showed it to everyone.  I took my nephew over to look at it and my golden girl followed us, we were looking at the footprint, when she decided to lay right down next to it (for a tummy rub) and wiped it out with her tail!!!  Oh man, that was horrible to see!  I knew they were there, but now I have my own proof!","Memorial Day weekend 2001, first time I went to the property I found a strange little footprint about 4"" long, sunk into the dry sand about 2"", which looks suspiciously similar to the big one I found in 2018.

53033,5099,65650,2015,Fall,October,WA,King County,I have the exact location of when we first heard it. It was by the little cove area on the trail. I have no idea how far up the trail but I would be able to find it again.,Mt Si,Little Si trail,"I was hiking at Little Si in Washington State with a friend who was visiting from out of town. It was pouring rain so we left our phones but we went anyway and started our hike sometime in the morning.   We got to an interesting little part off the trail where a little waterfall was pouring off from a cliff above, maybe like 20 feet up. We turned back after that spot and started heading back but while we were walking we heard what I first thought was an alarm, but it sounded organic. At the end of the alarm was a very strange vocalization like an ape mixed with human. The alarm sound happened over 10 times and at the end of each sustained holler was the strange vocalization.   After the second or third alarm sound and vocalization I started making the sounds back to whatever it was. My friend and I both listened intently trying to identify what the sound could possibly be. We ruled out human right away because whatever was making that sound had a huge lung capacity and we both immediately knew it couldnt be human. As we listened, and I kept responding, the way the mouth moved made us also rule out a wolf or coyote. It sounded like it had lips...I know that sounds strange but we both said whatever was making the sound had a mouth like a human or ape. I responded three or four times before I realized what else it could possibly be.   Amy, we gotta go. NOW I said. She asked why and I said, I think Im hitting on a Sasquatch. We have to get the hell out of here. I know Im making it sound like a joke, but I grew up hearing about Sasquatch stories and I never thought they could be actually real. So I was a little joking when I told her I was hitting on a Sasquatch but the sound was so large, reverberating through the mountainside, I also thought whatever that is sounds like its getting closer and the only thing it could possibly be, however unlikely, was a large beast with lips like a human or ape. So, we ran. We ran the rest of the way down the trail and got to the car where our phones were. We didnt see anyone else on the trail.   When we got our phones out I googled Pacific Northwest wildlife sounds to try and find out what it really was. We looked up wolf, coyote, elk, and anything else we could think of. So I finally said, We have to look up Bigfoot sounds...its the only thing left. She looked at me and nodded. She didnt grow up hearing any stories of Bigfoot because she is from the Midwest. I found a few recordings and immediately the hair on our arms and neck stood straight up. This was 5 years ago but just writing this Im getting goosebumps all over again.   I was at an art sale today in Leavenworth and a man was selling art. We bought a painting with a Sasquatch standing behind a tent and it reminded me of this story. That artist doesnt really know much about Sasquatch but said since painting them hes heard countless first hand stories from people out there and so I shared mine with him. It made me want to see if there was anyone else who would want to know, and my brother sent me here. Anyway, thanks. It feels good to get this experience out to the right people. Im still skeptical but cannot deny what I heard, and I still have no explanation for it. The vocalization  I heard was very similar to the Sierra recordings (forgot the name of the guy who recorded them) but the sustained big barreled alarm with the sounds at the end was a bit different than those recordings.   I was going to change the date because it happened on October 31st, and I thought no one would believe me. But it is what it is. Also, we were so freaked out that I left a note warning other campers and made an email address asking if anyone else heard it, to contact me. No one has (I havent checked it in years, however).   ","We heard cracking, like wind knocking trees down in the woods but I thought it was from the wind and rain.

53009,5103,65667,2020,Summer,June,WA,Clallam County,"On June 22, 2020; I was parked just outside the Swan Bay launch site at Ozette Lake on a logging road. About a 1/4 mile from the launch site heading east take a left onto the logging road into the clear cut. I parked approx a 1/4 mile in and my RV could be seen by the road. ",Old Royal,Hoko/Ozette road off Hwy 112,"I was accompanied by my wife and 15-yo son. We has built a fire and when the sun had set I mentioned to my wife that Sasquatch's are known to answer howls. I am on the BFRO site 4-days a week to track sightings and am a firm believer after reading Dr. Meldrum's book: Sasquatch-Legend Meets Science. I made a howl like the 1994 Moaning Howl Ohio call recording on this site. I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice loudly. I cupped my face and let out a howl. Its was answered.   I was facing east and let out a howl every 30-60 seconds that was answered progressively closer. Astonished, I kept it up and the return was always closer. My wife fled to into the RV in fear. My son would not come out. I was not in fear but in hopes of seeing a Sasquatch. I did not have my cell phone with me to record the sasquatch returning howls. I grabbed my .44 magnum revolver (just in case) and a flashlight scanning the trees in hopes to see a illuminated red pair of eyes. As soon as I had my pistol in my hand there were no more returning howls. I was never in fear but in awe. There must have been 10-12 howls and returns. With the first reply. I would guess that the Sasquatch at least a mile away and with the last, maybe a 1/4 to an 1/8 of a mile if not closer.   On 6/30/2020, we returned home and I had my wife and son listed to the 1994 Ohio howls. They were shocked that that was what they had heard.

53031,5111,65807,1977,Fall,October,WA,Jefferson County,South on Hwy. 101 ,Forks,Hwy 101,"My sighting happened over 40 years ago & until this time Ive never written or reported anything about it. Except for relaying my experience to a few family members & friends, this is the first time Ive told my story. I am 69 years old & I believe its time to tell my story.   Im sorry to say that time has invaded my memory & I dont recall all the exact details. I believe it was fall of 1977. My boyfriend & I were on our way to Kalaloch Lodge from Seattle for the weekend. I believe we left after work on a Friday, took the ferry to Kingston & then traveled south along highway 101. The incident occurred somewhere between Forks & Kalaloch. It was very late, very dark, a clear night and with few cars on the road. My boyfriend was driving & we were quiet, each in our own thoughts.   I love animals and Im always on the lookout for animal sighting. I happened to notice something that looked like an animal coming up ahead on the right side of the road in the shoulder. I didnt mention it to my boyfriend, instead I was concentrating on the approaching animal & trying to figure out what it was. As the creature came into focus, I noticed it was about 4 tall, standing perfectly upright, long arms, long legs, very thin with long brown hair covering his entire body & face. He was standing still but waving his arms across his face. As we passed him, I looked out the side passenger window directly into his face & he looked directly into mine. I gasped with surprise & disbelief! Unfortunately, my boyfriend did not see the creature & asked me what was wrong. I cant put into words what happened at that moment. I saw something that didnt fit into my realm of knowledge, beliefs or experiences. I was scared to death & scared into utter silence. I was afraid to look back  did it jump onto the car? Was it running behind the car?   Immediately, the description that came to my mind was a monkey man. It wasnt until we arrived at Kalaloch Lodge that I told my boyfriend what I saw. Once Id had more time to calm down and think about the experience, I wondered if it was the headlights on bright that could have caused the creature to freeze & wave his arms in an attempt to block the lights from his eyes. For years after this experience, whenever I re-told my story to friends or family, I always referred to the creature as a monkey man. It was not until years later when I first viewed the Patterson-Gimlin video of the Sasquatch that I thought  this is what I saw, only smaller. I do believe what I saw was a young Sasquatch. I cannot be certain what I saw that night, but what I know for absolute certainty is that what I saw was not any known Pacific NW animal.

53063,5124,66003,2020,Summer,September,WA,Spokane County,"Sound/howl seemed like it was a couple blocks away, perhaps closer to 7 Mile Road and near the Spokane River.  ","Nine Mile Falls, WA",291,"Heard: at approx 2:15am my labrador retriever started barking at something outside.  This is not unusual as we live on a closed golf course which is adjacent to Riverside State Park and we often have varying types of nature near our home.  After letting the dog out to relieve himself I returned to bed.  Outside temp was approx 55-60 degrees and we had the bedroom windows open.  Our bedroom faces the closed golf course.   What I heard next was a loud howl.  At first I thought it was a police car or ambulance traveling on highway 291 that had turned on its siren, but then the sound simply went from soft to loud to suddenly stopping. So, it was not a siren.  I listened intently to try to figure out what was going on and about 2 minutes later I heard a similar but more faint ""siren"" sound.  This was not a coyote or a wolf, nor was it the sound of a neighbor's dog.  The sound was different and as I said, it sounded like a siren with only one whooooooo.  I noted the time (2:20am).  It sounded like it could have been a few blocks away (I thought around 7 Mile Road).  I have been checking local websites and facebook groups to see if anyone else heard it, but so far nothing.  I can't be the only one to have heard this.  Perhaps a person was making the noise as part of Big Foot hunting??    The other thing I'd like to report is that we feed birds and squirrels in our yard.  Approx 6weeks prior we had our squirrel feeder torn off the tree at night.  We heard a crash outside and couldn't identify anything that particular night but the following morning we discovered the feeder's lid which is crewed into the top on a heavy hinge, was ripped off.  We jokingly said maybe we should look for Big Foot prints or hair in the area.  Anyway,  the howl was definitely something not of the ordinary.  Thank you.","Perhaps of note is that the golf course had recently been mowed for fire safety.  The course closed Sept 2018 and no maintenance was performed since.  Weeds had been very high with LOTS of deer (and moose) traveling around and through the course.  Course was mowed at the request of homeowners due to fire concerns, so there was a significant change to the 90-acres that was the golf course.","I was home alone, so no other witnesses.",Some locals have said that there were sightings near the river in more slightly remote areas than my immediate neighborhood.  I believe in 2018 there was a sighting in neighboring Stevens County.,2:20am,We live in a forested with the Spokane River only a 1/4 mile away. ,02
