06039,6,83,1988,Fall,October,CA,Madera County,The sighting took place at the end of a road leading to a trail head that leads into the back of yosemite park. The road starts 500 ft from Bowler campground going north off of beasore rd.,Bass Lake Ca.,Beasore Rd.,"Early in the morning before light my friend and I decided to hike up a ridge and sit down where we could see a lot of area hoping to see a deer that we could bag. We parked in an area just below the ridge where when the sun lightened up enough we could easily hike up to the top in about 20 minutes. As it got light enough to see the top, we noticed someone already on the ridge wearing what seemed to be black of all things. He had no light, and no gun, and we wondered where he came from because we had been camped there for 11 days, and no one had come by that whole time. We watched him dig around in some brush for at least 30 minutes, pausing occasionaly for long periods to just stare in different directions. We joked that it was probably a hunter from L.A. because anyone would be crazy to wear just black during deer, and bear season. Then he began to walk down the hill right for us, now we never left the truck yet, and he would walk a little ways and the stop and look around just as if he was hunting, but with no rifle. He walked just like a human, so at this time there was no reason to think it was anything but a man. After a little while it was getting light enough to see even better, and he was still walking straight for us. When he was about 50 yards away we both at the same time realized we were not watching a man, but this was a Bigfoot! He walks like a man, but he was not a man. He had jet black, shiny fur, with a reddish color around where his eyes were. At this moment I was ready to run clear home in one leap! I had to see this thing up close, and he had not noticed us yet, so I tried to open the door of the truck real easy so he wouldn't notice, but that old ford truck was anything but quiet, and he heard the latch release and took one good look before breaking into a run. I tried to bring the scope up to view him closer, but this guy could really move, and I could not get my eye into the scope before he got behind a tree and nev er came out. It took all the nerve in my body to walk over to the tree, but he was not there he flat disappeared. My friend was hollering the whole time not shoot, and thought I was crazy for trying to go find him, or a track, or something. All I know is I have different kind of respect for the back woods now, and I give a lot of room between me and large objects. I was brought up in these woods camping, and hunting every year and only heard of such things.",,Just two of us sitting in a p/u waiting for a little light.,"The man I was with was my fathers best friend, and he told me later that day that was the fourth bigfoot he had seen in that area, but would deny it to his grave for fear of ridicule. He has since past away when he was hit unexpectedly by a semi truck. He told me was hunting with his son, watching him zig zag up a hill around noon,in 1970 when a bigfoot walked between him and his son the whole time the bigfoot never took his eyes off his son. He felt that it did not intend any harm so he did not get alarmed. The fist time he said he was parked in the same place, and he was in his camper again around noon reading a book when someone walked by and waved to him through the side window. He didn't hear anyone drive up so he thought he would go out and say high. There was no one there, and then he realized the window was at least seven and a half feet above the ground, it could not have been a mere man.",5:30am to 6:45am The weather was clear and the sun was not quite shining directly on me.,,

The only people I told were my dad and uncle who were deer hunting with me at the time. I had left our camp before sunrise so I would be deep into the woods when the sun came up. I had just come out of the tree line into a clearing when I got a feeling something was watching me, I thought it was probably just deer but as I went across the clearing out into the open I felt really strange like something just glaring at me. I walked east into the sun and wind to the edge of the bank where there was still paches of snow on the ground because this was early October in X3B deer hunting zone. That's when I saw half a foot print in the snow.  It looked like the heal of a human foot only this one was about 8 inches wide. Then around 6 feet towards the edge of the bank was the front half of another print with five toes only they were big around like a man's bare foot would have been after the snow melted around it, but they were not from a man and the tracks were fresh. I looked over the edge of the bank and the side was all flat rock shail that looked like it had been recently disturbed. About 100 yards down was thick timber and as I looked down into it I felt like something was looking right up at me. I felt chills big time right then and felt like I needed to get away from there. Thats all that happend but I really think there was something down there that either saw me or heard me at least half a mile away because I was hunting with the wind in my face.","Nothing heard seen or smelled, very strong wind blowing that morning on top of the mountain.",There was only me.,none.,"Early morning with the sun just coming up. very cold wind, cold enough to freez the tears from your watering eyes.","At the top of the mountain overlooking the edge.

06017,21,147,2000,Summer,June,CA,El Dorado County,south of South Lake Tahoe,,,"At our home south of South Lake Tahoe, we have been hearing tell-tale screams for the last three months. I have several recordings of these screams, and have been in coordination with three of the curators involved with the BFRO for northern California. Suffice it to say that almost nightly, we have been witness to a resounding number of screams/wails which have not been attributable to coyote nor other ""known"" forms of animal call/sound.  The sounds have occurred from 9:00pm through 7:00am in the morning on a consistent basis.  I have made several recordings, mostly from my bedroom window. We have made several all-night forays into the forest in an attempt to capture the sounds. My brother and I have made extensive backpacking trips into the wilderness surrounding this area in an attempt to pin down the most likely locations for activity, and we feel we have narrowed it down very well (based upon our normal reception of sound and habitational demographic...) I have found tracks in this area which i have photographed as well as ""beds"" with torn branches/etc. which may very well be attributable to bear activity, although the screams at night are definitely not.  Areas in question are well off of the beaten path. Description:  A mournful wail. Sounds like a locator beacon (like a sonar ""ping"") usually answered by another of lower pitch, and both seem to converge at some point--after which both cease to sound.  We (my brother and I) have noticed coyote howls interspersed with the ""other"" sounds.  We have thoroughly explored the areas surrounding our location, some of which our dogs refused to enter.  We've camped out all night with bait, only to give up and head in to hear them after we've been tucked away for a good thirty minutes--leaving us dead tired with no ""substantial evidence"".

06105,22,160,1972,Summer,July,CA,Trinity County,Papoose Lake in the Trinity Alps Primitive Area.  14 miles from trailhead up Rattlesnake Creek.  Papoose lake is a large lake in a glacial cirque and is easily located just below Thompson peak in the Trinity Lake.,Junction City,299,"     A tremendous storm came in off the Pacific.  My friend and I took shelter in a plastic ""tube tent"".  About Midnight we heard a large animal walking around our camp.  The animal had two legs, not 4.  The animal had soft feet, not hooves.  The animal was walking through brush and the forest floor.  The weight of the animal was breaking branches, that, from the sound, were at least one inch in diameter.  The animal walked around our campsite screaming for most of 4 hours.  The screams were blood curdling, and almost human, but louder and unlike any animal I am familiar with. I have hiked the Trinity Alps all my life.  I know the trails and the environment intimately.  Better than Luther Linkhart who wrote the book on the Trinity Alps.  This was not a bear, I have heard and seen dozens of them and chased lots of them out of camp.  This was not a deer, I have seen hundreds of them and had them step over me at night when I camped on a trail.  This animal had two legs, the difference between a 4 legged and 2 legged gate is easily distinguished.  This animal was very heavy and was breaking large branches as it walked, but it had no hooves.  This was not a mountain lion.  I have had them follow me and have heard them scream.  Mountain lions do not snap branches. We were in the only stand of trees for a mile in any direction.  The animal took shelter in that stand of trees and spent the night with us, walking around our camp and screaming all night.  I am certain it was frightened as the wind was breaking large branches and there was a lot of lightning and thunder.  At some moments it was no more than 20 feet away, but it was too dark to see that far, and no way were we going to turn a flashlight on it.  It was truly frightening.  I was 16 at the time, but I was used to facing down mountain lions and chasing bears out of camp with a spoon and a plate.  This animal was terrifying. I found this page as a link from an SF Chronicle article.  When I loaded up the scream sound from Ohio, that was it.  Except, when that scream is from a frightened animal 30 feet from you no recording could ever do it justice. In the morning we looked for prints or sign, but a wet forest floor over granite is the wrong surface, and we found no sign.  We headed back the 14 miles to the car at top speed. I have hiked the Trinity Alps on over 300 trips during my life.  I have never gone back to that lake.","The weight of the animal, the volume and pitch of the screaming.  I believe the intense storm drove it to seek shelter near us or it would never have spent so much time in that proximity to humans.",My best friend at the time was hiking with me. He heard and felt everything I did.,"     The Trinity Alps are full of stories.  The animal lives there. I know this report is absurdly old.  But the sound you have from Ohio is it.  Put on headphones, go into a dark closet with no light, and run 100 watts through your headphones and it will come close to the real sound. I have continued to hike, fish and hunt that wilderness area for the last 28 years since then, and have had no other contact.  No prints, no unusual scat, no sounds, no sightings.  There are a million places an animal that size could live in the Alps forever without contact.","Midnight to 4 am  during a severe storm.

My ex and I had thrown our mattress in the back of our truck, which sat about 1.5 feet lower than the canopy windows. The dream I had frightened me, because the face I was seeing was not human. I woke up in a sweat and happened to be facing the window in the canopy in time to see a large dark form moving away from the window, toward the front of the truck and out of my view. I sat up and cautiously peeked out of the canopy window to see this VERY LARGE,dark, hairy figure moving quickly up the hill into the forest from the campground. It walked upright with the gait of a human, it moved through the trees giving me an estimate of it's height at about 7ft. I remember loosing my scientific detachment at that time and as the ""thing"" disappeared further up the hill, I shook my ex awake and through a choked and somewhat hysterical description explained that I was very frightened. I couldn't calm down, and he decided it would be a good idea to leave. We quickly got out of the back of the truck and noticed a very dank and musky smell. This scared me even further and we loaded our things and drove out of the camp. I wish I had been in a better frame of mind during the event, however the memory of the face I had seen, apparently in the half awake state( and still see in my mind) was not condusive to rational thinking. It was vaguely humanoid with large protruding brows, the eyes were dark and intense. The nose was a strange mixture of gorilla and human. The mouth was severe and somewhat turned down with fleshy lips. The facial hair was not on nose, eyes or mouth. The head was conical shaped, with a pronounced saggital crest. The jaw was not prognathic. Frankly, it scared the s*** out of me. I must state that I am a student of anthropology at Portland State University, and have never (outside of immediate family members) discussed this with my colleagues. I have always been fascinated with the ""legends""  but perhaps I never believed them truly until that moment. My family is amused by my story but think perhaps I just had a bad dream. Doubt it.",,"I was the only observer of the ""thing"", however my ex-husband can verify my extreme fright and the weird smell.","I was not aware of stories in that particular area. Of course I knew about Patterson and Bluff Creek, but I had never considered ever being a witness.","The incident occered in the early hours of the morning, approximately 4:30-5:00 am.

I was startled to see something that was dark brownish and vertical,(since I would have clearly seen any horizonal part of it's body,from my vantage point.)I yelled for my friend,""Hey!Al!Come here!"" Unfortunatly, he was tired and very uninterested...""Whaaaat?...""Come here! What the Hell is THAT?!!"" At my yell,the thing looked up at me.

You can then go west on highway #2, untill you get to Mt. Waterman.  The Caynon's name is Cooper Caynon.",San Gabriel Mountains,Highway #2,"Dear Sirs: This early 1970s sighting was not of my own. I was a boy when my brother-inlaw of that day and one or two of his hunting friends had an excellant and fairly long term sighting, both via their eyes and through high powered rifle scopes.   However I can relate some of this information to you and even put you in touch with two of the possible three people, can't guarantee they will talk with you about the sighting, but one never knows. In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.   What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it, but could not because it looked to human!   Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior.   Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall.   They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don't remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear.   About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company.   Don still lives in Baldwin Park, CA but maybe moving to San Diego, CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related.

When it saw our vehicle approaching it began to run from the center of the road to the other side into the trees as we passed. The general motion was from right to left heading west to east toward the lake form the campgroud area.  The strange thing was that it was clearly not a bear or any kind of four legged animal. It had a distinkt two legged run as I would expect a human to have, but was covered with hair (or fur) that was much longer than that of other furry animals and had a rust colored hugh to it. It ran slightly bent over and had medium hight (5-6'). It happened too fast to make out special features like feet, hands or the shape of the head. I could only see the running form of the body.  The first thing that I thought was that it looked like a big foot, but was hesitant to suggest that to my wife. She in her exitement pointed to it and began to say ""look at the bear"" but stopped up short. I told her that I didn't look like that to me.  She was the one who suggested that it  really looked more like a Sasquatch, and at that point I know that we had both seen the same thing.  A few reflections: 1. I would prefer to believe that it was just a prank by some fun seeking camper, but it was very real. This animal did not run or move as I would expect a human to run or move. What we saw was not a prank. 2. I can't think of a reason why anyone would go to that much work to fool a motorist for no apparent reason. 3. I have been a bit of a sceptic until yesterday, but we saw what we saw. I've been unable to find any other expanation for it. 4.

During this camping trip we went to that higher campground and thought about camping, but changed our minds","Foresthill, CA",Foresthill Road,"I was camping with my father and my brother at a little spot that we had ""discovered"" last year and had camped out a few times. We had arrived early in the afternoon, set up camp, I shot a can or two with my pistol, ate dinner, and had settled in for the evening (it was about sunset), and we had heard this fairly high pitched ""moan"" or wail, that continued off and on throughout the evening. It seemed to be coming from up the hill at first, and if I had to guess, within 300 yards. Well, as time went on, we heard  the noise move down the hill and down the side of the mountain, which is extremely hard to traverse. My dad and I kept speculating as to what it was, as he had hunted bear, deer, and elk, and could not place what it was. We thought, from the tone, that it could have been a lost animal, as it had a mournful tone to it. It had a very resonant quality to it, like it was a good sized animal. Anyway, the noise seemed to move along the side of us, and then we would hear it back at its original location rather quickly. I briefly thought that it was a large bird that kept flying back and forth, but it finally dawned on my dad that there was two sounds; they seemed to be calling to each other; that unnerved me, and my father and I went to take a look with our spotlights and me with my pistol and camera (I always carry a little disposable camera in case I see a bear or deer). We walked up the hill, (on the dirt road), maybe 50 yards and saw nothing; when we got back to camp, I jumped in my truck and drove up the hill maybe 3-400 yards and saw nothing; I did not get out of my truck to look around as I was highly agitated (read:pretty dang spooked) I turned around and kept flashing my spotlight down the side of the mountain occasionally and went past camp down the hill on to Foresthill Road and drove up the road a little ways before turning around again and heading to camp. My dad and brother reported that they had heard nothing and it was quiet for awhile. I sat around the fire and watched the tv that my dad had brought with him; my brother was tired and had gone to bed fairly early. Everything seemed fairly quiet until I went to go ""number one"" by a big pine tree across the road and as I was juggling with the belt that was holding my pistol in its holster, I heard that noise behind the tree and it seemed like it was maybe 30 yards down the hill, it startled me, to say the least, and I ran back to the relative safety of the campfire holding up my pants with one hand and my pistol with the other, much to my dads amusement. Needless to say, I did not venture from camp the rest of the night. We continued to hear the noises until we went to bed, around 0330 or so, I remember hearing it around 0345 and yelling to my dad (he slept in the back of his camper, my brother and I in my tent, 15 ft away) ""there it is again!"", but he was sleepy. I finally drifted off to sleep shortly thereafter and no noise was heard again. THE ""NOISE"": Resonant. Very similar to the ""Howl"" on your website, but of a shorter duration, 2-3 seconds or so each time.  A note about my father and brother: my brother was very tired from working the night before and he drank quite a bit of beer on this evening; he may have also thought that I was trying to ""spook"" him as he does not go camping much. He was disinterested and does not remember much. My fathers curiosity was piqued, but he was not agitated or spooked like I was; his philosophy is that humans are the most dangerous creatures out in the forest,and this was an animal, though he was not sure what it was and still doesnt. Also, he states that I heard brush or sticks being broken, but I cant recall stating that. I would not have even wrote this in until I had read the reports from the Tahoe area, which described such a similar noise, and is only about 60-70 miles as the crow flies from there.  ","About a week or two before, I went up with a friend and we had thought we had heard those noises,( along with a big bullfrog like noise that I have never heard but that time,) but they were distant and did not last very long. My friend commented that it sounded like a woman with a lowered tone, screaming. I had gone up there a few more times after those two times,once by myself, but heard nothing.

My brother 15 month's older and a friend my age.  I am now 53 years old.  We lived in the country outside of Eureka California.  We went fishing at the end of our rural Rd, Ole Hanson Rd.  As kids would do we wandered off in the woods and found an old logging road that we decided to walk up.  About 15 minutes up the road we heard a noise in the woods on the other side of the road, we huddled together and waited to see who was there. We saw a creature on the other side, in the trees.  We began to run back down the road and the creature kept pace with us although we knew due to the size it could easely go faster. it stayed in the brush and trees and when it would get ahead of us, it would stop and watch us but never came across the road just followed and watched from across the road. When we reached the center of clearing on Hanson's property we stopped and looked back.  It was no longer there.  About two years ago I asked my brother if he remembered the incident, thinking it was something I had just imagened, and he said, just as wided eyed as that day, yes it was real.

06105,117,533,2000,Summer,August,CA,Trinity County,"We were at a campsite located at Three Forks, which is near the source of the Mad River.  We were just off the paved road about thirty yards.","Ruth, California","Three Forks, near the Double AA Ranch","I am not sure I have anything to report, but cannot quit thinking about an experience I had this August 2000 in the Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California in Trinity County.  I grew up near there so am not easily ""spooked"" by nature's noises.  While camping with my family, my husband and I heard this very strange noise off in the distance.  It was weird enough for me to ask him, ""What was that?""  He did not know either.  Having grown up in the mountains, I ruled out coyotes (we heard a pack of coyotes every other night we camped but not that night), foxes, and mountain lions.  I do not (or should I say have not believed) in the legendary Bigfoot.  My father was a timberfaller for nearly 30 years and never experienced any Bigfoot sightings, so I am not sure what to make of this strange sound.  To give you an idea of the indescribable noise, my husband's first impression was it was a bear that got hit by a car, although we did not hear a car for three days.  But after listening to the taped scream from Del Norte County, CA, the recorded sound was very similar to what we heard except it went on for hours.  I had my husband listen to it this morning and did not show him what it was, just had him close his eyes and listen to the recording and he agreed the sound we heard this summer was similar to the recording.  I am trying to rule out the Bigfoot possibility, that is why I am going to your organization.  This all happened on a full moon which further adds to the spookiness.  It lasted from about 10:30 at night until about 3 am.  It started to the left of out camp (no other campers around, as we do not stay in campgrounds) and got closer.  When it was directly across from our camp (all the while traveling along the rocky river bar) the noises stopped.  But what is strange is our four dogs started acting scared and started to dig to get inside the tent.  They whimpered, and having a Jack Russell, black lab and two dachshunds, acted out of character.  The did not bark at the noise which is what they would have done had it been an animal. They acted afraid.  Then the noise started on the right of the camp for quite some time, then started getting closer again. Again ceasing when it was across from our camp sight.  It went off to the left and quit about 3am.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and I don't think I want to ""see"" what mande those noises, and like I said I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.  I would like to find a simple answer to the sound.  As a side not, I had a video camera with me, but was too afraid to get out of the tent and go to the truck to get it!

My best guess is the noises were coming along the creek area, which is very rocky.

06105,134,596,1998,Fall,October,CA,Trinity County,"Mud Springs: a hunters campsite with a freshwater spring, near the intersections of USFS roads 29N73 and 29N32 and 29N48 (they all meet)...  (40 DEG 21' 30"" North / 123 DEG 08' 30"" West) on South Dubakella Mountain.",Platina,29N73 USFS Road,"On Thursday, 10-30-98, at about 1230 hours, I arrived at the Yolla Bolla District Ranger Office of the Trinity National Forest.  I had planned a solo five-day backpacking trip to the area of  Post Mountain and Mud Springs (40 DEG 20' 00"" North 123 DEG 13'  00""; West) within the Trinity National Forest.   I had just relocated to California from Hawaii and was eager to get back into the forest.  I had seen a sensationalized Bigfoot story on a local Sacramento TV station, about a group of hunters that had an encounter within the Trinity National Forest, near a landmark called Mud Springs.  I grew up in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, so I knew of Sasquatch while growing up, and was always interested in the phenomenon.  I planned my trip carefully: because of the time of year (Fall), my relative unfamiliarity with the region, and because I was making the trip solo.  Solo backpacking trips need to have a carefully laid itinerary in case of problems: so rescuers have a means of finding you.  ARRIVAL AT RANGER STATION  When I arrived at the ranger station, I was pleasantly greeted by the staff, signed into the visitors log and provided them with a copy of itinerary and emergency contact information.  Being a former police officer, the conversation between the rangers and I was very relaxed - we talked shop for a while.  When they noted my destination on the itinerary, the rangers asked if I was going into the area in response to the Bigfoot sighting.  I told them I was interested in what was seen, and asked for their opinion of the sighting.  All four of the rangers stated that Bigfoot was just as real as the bears, deer and cougar within the park.  Two of the rangers said they had been up to the location and found a set of tracks.  They also stated that finding tracks, is not all that uncommon, and that there have been casts of the tracks made in the past.  CHANGE OF PLANS & WRONG MUD SPRINGS  I then learned that many there are two locations within the park called Mud Springs, and that my itinerary was for the wrong location!  The rangers told me that many visitors were going to the wrong location, and that they had not corrected them.  I laid down my map, and the rangers helped me plan a new itinerary for my trip.  To the correct Mud Springs (40 DEG 21' 30"" North / 123 DEG 08' 30""; West) on South Dubakella Mountain.  The plan was now to spend the night in the hunter's camp, and leave my vehicle there.  The next day I would set out on foot.  It was already too late in the day to set out.  I would never make it to the second camp, before nightfall, and trying to find a safe place to camp in the dark is not smart.    ARRIVAL AT MUD SPRINGS  I arrived at the Mud Springs campsite, on 10-30-1998, at about 1400 hours.  The site had obviously been used by hunters.  There was a 4""diameter wood pole lashed between two trees at a height of about 7-8'.  It was obviously used to suspend the deer for gutting and skinning.  There was a large fire ring that had recently been used, and the normal debris that idiots leave at campsites: burnt tin cans, nylon cord, etc..  THE SPRING  After setting up my tent, and gathering wood for a fire, I walked over to the spring that was about 30-40 yards away.  I was very impressed by the amount of water that was trickling from the spring, and by the abundance of animal prints, droppings and scat.  This is obviously the main watering hole in the area.    Early autumn is typically the driest time of year.  Streams, creeks, rivers and lakes are at their lowest levels.  The water from this spring only flows down from it's source about 50 yards before disappearing into dry sand and rocks.  My impression was that if all the other animals come here to drink so does Biggie.  And with the hunter's campsite so close to the spring, that may be why Biggie was displaying such aggressiveness.  That spring might serve as both his hunting ground and his water supply.  Both of which are valuable to a nomadic creature.  THE ENVIRONMENT  The whole area was extremely quiet, even in late afternoon/dusk when many animals begin to venture out.  I saw only two ravens and a couple blue jays, the entire time I was there.  No squirrels, no deer, and no noise.  As many of you know, the forest has solitude but is far from silent.   BEDTIME  I had made a small fire that evening.  I do not normally make a fire when backpacking, but because I had a fire ring available, a plentiful supply of deadwood and it had been years since my last trip, I decide to enjoy one.  I turned in at about 2150 hours, and was asleep within minutes.  AWAKENED BY SNAPPING BRANCH  At about 2230 hours/10-30-1998, I was awakened by the sound of a large snapping branch.  It was not a branch falling, and the branch gave a cracking noise that made it sound like it was a thick branch.  Even though my eyes snapped open with the sound, I just laid in my sleeping bag listening.  I didn't move.  Then with my head close to the ground resting on my ground pad, I heard it.  Not the clop of hooves or the padding of paws, but the dull, vibrating thud of footsteps!  I nearly defecated in my sleeping bag.  I was keenly aware of what I was hearing, and I could feel the adrenaline in my veins.  The footsteps where to the northeast of my tent, when first detected.  My hearing was trained in that direction because that is the same direction I heard the branch snap too.  I estimated them to be 10 to twenty feet away, judging from the vibration and sound.  Two more steps and the thing making them, was in front of my tent, about 5-10 feet away. Then the footsteps faded to the southwest with two more footsteps.  I was laying there scared to death, thinking about what I was going to do, when all of a sudden, my pots down at the kitchen moved and clanged together!  I was not imagining anything now, and knew it was not a dream!  I grabbed my headlamp and illuminated my tent, trying to drive off my visitor.  After I waited about two minutes, I looked out my tent and saw nothing.  I pulled on my boots and walked to my kitchen area.  There I found my nested cookware pots unnested, and spread out.  What ever unnested those pots had thumbs!  GONE WITH THE WIND  That was all the evidence needed to convince a former policeman and combat hardened Marine that he was out of his element at the moment.  I had only been chased out of a campsite once before, and that was by a mama grizzly and her cubs in the Silver Skagit Valley of Washington State.  This was far more terrifying.  A HAIR IS FOUND  The pots and pans were sitting next to my backpack.  I left it outside the tent near the kitchen, and bear-bagged my food in a tree about 50 yards away to prevent bears from coming into my camp.  The backpack was brand new, and did not have any food odor in it.  And since there were no squirrels or evidence of rodents, I just left it on the ground propped against a log in the kitchen area.  The pots were about 2 feet away from the backpack.  After dropping my tent, and rolling up my sleeping bag, I went to put them in the lower portion of my backpack.  When I reached for the Velcro closure there was a big hair stuck to the Velcro!  The hair, which is in my hands now, as I write this, is approximately 5.5 inches long, from root to tip and dark brown in color.  As you get closer to the tip of the hair, the color changes to reddish/orange.  It is somewhat course in appearance, about 3 times the diameter of a human hair.  I collected the hair and placed it in a Ziploc bag.  HEADED BACK TO RED BLUFF  I threw everything in my Ford Explorer and drove all the way to Red Bluff, before I finally calmed down.  It is not something I will ever forget.

06109,140,615,1997,Winter,November,CA,Tuolumne County,We were located in Eagle Meadows.  Do not recall the specific directions to this particular site.,"Strawberry, California",California State Highway 108,"My husband and I were hunting in Sonora. Our location was Eagle Meadows which is above Strawberry, California off of California Highway 108. It was a sunny, cold day.  We dressed in our camoflauge and began our hunt.  We were deep in the woods had climbed down a hillside of boulders and into what looked like a perfect hunting area.  Forest on either side of a meadow approximately 300 yards wide. We found pine trees to sit under (they had low branches) to await our perfect buck and so put on our skunk scent. My husband was approximately 10 feet away from me.  We each had views across the meadow.  But I could not share his nor could he share my view for there was a clump of trees and bushes about 100 yards in front of us and positioned between the trees we were under.   About 20 minutes into the hunt we heard branches breaking across the meadow.  My husband quietly told me to be aware of bears.  To stay alert.  It was approximately 10:30/11:00 a.m. when I looked back across the meadow and saw something that wasn't there 3 to 5 minutes ago.  Immediately, I thought ""Could it be a Bear?""  I rationalized if it was only shadows from trees, a dead log with light coming through?  But none of my theories fit. The image I saw was black.  The sun was shining from behind it so the front looked black.  Then I thought ""It must be a Sasquatch.""  I saw most of his head, 3/4's of his chest area and down to what could possibly be the waist.  The rest was hidden by the trees/bushes.  After totally analyzing the figure, the blackness, I thought if it is a bigboot it must have eyes.  I brought my small camouflage binoculars up to my eyes slowly and looked across this meadow.  It was then that fear and anxiousness prevailed.  For I saw two yellow eyes watching me very intently.  I have never been so scared.  I was afraid to move an inch.  I continued observing for about 15 minutes and he stood there and watched me too.  We were both very still.  I was wondering if he would move, why he was so intent on observing me?  Then my instinct told me to move and get out of there.  I motioned to my husband that I was going back to camp but did not tell him why.  My fear didn't allow me to speak.  My intent was to leave the area as quickly as possible. I high-tailed it back to camp.  Up the stoney hillside and through the woods all the time looking over my shoulder.  Later when my husband came in I asked him if he saw anything unusual?  He said he didn't.  So the Bigfoot didn't walk across the meadow or my husband would have seen him.   The Sasquatch found me.  I was there under that tree first, minutes before he came into the area.  I honestly believe without a doubt that this was a Sasquatch.  I do not believe that it was a dangerous threat to me or it would have advanced towards me.  I do not believe it was a bear because a bear would not have stood still for so long.  I wonder if these creatures are just as about us as we are of them.  If only I could go back to that point in time.  I would have slowly moved across the meadow towards it, to see what it would have done and to investigate farther.   My husband said, ""What would you have done if it charged you?""  I said, ""Run and scream.""  My point is, how will anyone ever know the truth if they don't cautiously and tamely approach one.  Would love the opportunity to go on a real sighting and/or search.  The opportunity to see a Sasqatch in motion would be awesome.",,I was the only person to see this Bigfoot.,No have not heard anyone else's reports. ,A cool sunny day with clear skys.,It was a pine forest.

06009,142,629,1968,Fall,,CA,Calaveras County,,"Railroad Flats, Calif.",,"In the late 1960's my father and I went deer hunting in the area of Railroad Flat, California We arrived late one afternoon and set up camp,then we decided to go seperate ways and scout the area around camp for sign of deer. I climbed a small rise and came to an open area with a wide path running along the top of the hill. I proceded to follow the path for a short ways but I had an uncomfortable feeling. I didn't see any deer tracks so I returned to where we had camped.            The next morning I discovered it had rained lightly during the night leaving the ground muddy.I climbed the rise to the path where I had been the day before. When I came to the path I immediately saw large foot prints, they were very deep in the mud and about 14 or 15 inches in length. They were shaped like human bare feet. They were heading down the path that I had followed the day before, some of the foot prints were on top of the ones that I had left the day before. I proceeded to follow them down the path, when the path sloped downword the prints slid leaving elongated prints. The path continued on along the ridge top but the tracks suddenly took a left turn heading off of the trail and down the side into the trees and underbrush, needless to say I didn't follow them.

06003,234,802,2000,Spring,April,CA,Alpine County,"Hwy 4 to Ebbott's Pass road was closed for winter conditions. We had mountain-biked four miles up the road, then taken a trail west up another 2000 feet to some mines. The trail is impossible to see if you are driving by fast. ",Markleeville ,Hwy 4 ,"I have to say, I was looking for just such a thing, being that I have an interest in the phenomenon (for lack of a better term). The ground was rather hard-packed with sand by the river-crossing areas. While passing a patch of mud from a spring I examined it and found the definite impressions of a five-toed human foot. I really couldn't believe it due to the odds of me actually wanting to see it (trying to be objective here). I checked for claw marks, such as a bear would leave, and found none.  The footprint had pine needles covering most of it. Upon inspection I found the rest of the footprint was also there, down to the heel, and it measured approximately 13-15 inches in length. My brother and an Indian friend of ours, John, cleared away some of the needles to get a better look at it. (we were joking that John had some friends out there that wanted to make sure we had a fun time.) We took, I believe, two photos of this print with my hands pointing to the front and back of the track, but with the sun dirctly overhead, and not really a professional camera (although , I guess, Pentax is good enough for Steve ). I'm not quite sure how they'll make out.   I was now determined to search the rest of the trail, and made sure that I went first so as to not let anyone else disturb other potential tracks. Right away in a sandy spot ahead I discovered another one, followed by more. One of the tracks was half the size of the first, and it almost appeared to be three-toed in places. We took shots of at least one more good one before heading up further to the summit. Being that there are open mines up there, I was a bit elated that we may perhaps be entering a ""hangout"" so to speak. nothing else was seen or smelt or felt (at least not at that time) apart from a set of indiscernible tracks going straight up a snow embankment on the other side of the canyon.   Upon returning, after summitting and checking out mines, I lagged behind to study the ground again. I found better traces in the waning light than I did earlier, including some tracks that were better than the first set. They were very clearly humanoid and large, with at least two sets again (large and small). Unfortunately, my brother and my friend had used up all of their film (not to mention they were way down the trail yelling back at me to ""hurry up""). Upon staying back, and realizing I was alone, I finally got the jitters. Could've been my mind and the events leading up to that, but I felt I was being watched and I felt the need to bolt down the trail.   I wouldn't have reported this at all apart from the fact that I figured this may be helpful for any geographical data-basing you may be doing (migration patterns, whatever.)   Also, this may or may not be related, but on a trip to Mt Lassen about a week before, my girlfriend, brother and I were the only people on the hill there (hiking up another closed-for-winter road, the loop). along the way we kept hearing a vibrating ""whoop whoop whoop"" that would seem to come from all directions. We chalked it up to being a bird, but the low vibrations could be felt. Interestingly also, the sound ""followed"" us. For whatever that's worth, perhaps there have been similar reports from the Lassen area.",nothing else unusual,"my brother, our friend, and myself hiking, exploring mines, mountain-biking.","we are relatively new to the area.

Talk about being petrified, because I sure was!!  I have lived around farm animals for most of my life and I know about what size this creature was, by just the sound.  It was bigger than a bear; besides bears can't walk on thier rear-legs for that long.","After I had ran to my friend's tent, I told him about what happened and asked if he heard anything.

06023,250,827,2000,Summer,July,CA,Humboldt County,There are a couple of lagoons a little after Trinidad when heading north.Right before getting to those there is a road on the left and the spot was about 1/4 mile after that road where the flat spot is on both sides of the road.,Trinidad,On Hwy 101 North,"On July 13 or August 17 of 2000 about 7:15 p.m. my  boyfriend, my 2 moth old baby, and I were headed back from Eureka, CA to Crescent City, CA. Somewhere past Trinidad and right before the lagoon we came around the corner on a four lane highway. Up ahead around 50 yards away a tall dark brown almost black ""man"" with long hair all over ran full stride across the highway. His arms hung long and the top of his neck seemed somewhat hunched over. The first thing that ran through my mind was ""What's a man doing running across the road right here?""  I thought this because we were completely out in the middle of no where.  Then I yelled, ""That was bigfoot!"" My boyfriend turned to me and said, ""shut up.  You're playing with me.""  I told him that he saw it with his own eyes.  By this time we had passed the point where he ran across the road into the forest, so we stopped and turned around.  We drove back to the point where he had re-entered the forest and stopped.  Peering into the thick forest it became too spooky for me and I drove off. I noticed where and when he chose to cross the road was very unique.  He waited until there were no cars except for ours which caught him off gaurd just comimg around the corner.  And where he crossed was flat.  It was the only place throughout the woods that didn't have a little hill on either side of the highway.  Some of the people I have told of this ask if it was a bear, but there is no way it could have been at the speed he ran.",,My boyfriend and I.  We were just talking about nothing on our way back home.,"About one week prior to our sighting, he was sighted around Cave Junction, OR by a family on a hike.  I guess the dad went off the trail momentarily to relieve himself when he saw bigfoot.  I think there was also a really strong odor that the whole family smelt.  There is an article in the Crescent City Triplicate newspaper.  It may be on record.  About a week after our sighting I heard he was spotted down by Sacramento.",The sun was just about to go down.  It was a clear day and a little dimmer than normal due to being in the forest.,Almost in the redwood forest.  Heavy pine forest and really thick.

My incident occurred while I was hunting in Round Mountain Calif., about 25 miles from Redding.  I was rifle hunting for deer in zone C1 on Roseburg land and had been up in that area for about three months scouting archery and at this time rifle.  My friends and I had camped up in this area off and on all this time, but on this day I had went to the mountain myself since my friends were done hunting for the year due to not seeing any bucks.  I however thought I would give it one more try.  It was late Sept 2000 early morning around 7.00 am and I was driving up a dirt road that I had been up and down many times before when I noticed a very old skid road covered in bush.  I knew that there was a large draw behind the bush because I could see just the top of it, so I parked my truck and started to walk up the skid road. There was a small creek on my left as the bush started to clear and I could see up the draw so I stopped to hunt for a while. At this time I was about 150 yds up the old road standing by the creek.  I looked down to the dirt on the creeks side and saw what looked a lot like a persons footprint but immediately knew better this track was easy 17""long and 6"" wide.","After seeing the first prints, I saw a small dirt mound with prints.  I seemed to me that it tried to get out of the area fast, like it saw me.",,In this area there are many sightings that have been reported.

06103,256,849,1968 or 69,Fall,November,CA,Tehama County,"After reaching Payne's creek, my father would drive even farther.  It was usually late at night when we would finaly arrive and I was usually asleep.","Payne's creek, Ca.",Old logging roads,"     My parents and I used to go deer hunting every deer season, (usually the 1st. of November) up around Payne's Creek, Ca.  We always went with my girlfriend Darla's family. It was a lot of fun.  My friend Darla and I would go for long walks in the woods.  We loved to see how many animals we could find.  We'd see everything from chipmunks to rattlesnakes.  We saw a lot of deer, too.  Probably more than our fathers ever saw.         We usually walked up an old logging road for a couple of miles and then we would turn around and go back to camp.         One time, I think the year was around 1968 or 69, we had invited another friend, Shirley, to come camping with us.  All three of us girls were in our early teens.  Darla and I decided to take Shirley out and show her where we always took our walks.        We walked and talked for along time.  Seeing all kinds of animals along the way. We were laughing and just having a good old time, like teenage girls do.    We ended up walking a little farther than we normally did.  Then we decided to go off the road and walk down the hill a little bit.  We came to a creek and we started walking on the rocks to cross it.  The creek was about 8 to 10 feet wide, so it took several steps to get across.       After we got across, we saw on one of the rocks, a big red lizard.  None of us had ever seen a lizard like that before.  It kind of scared us, so we thought we'd better start heading back.        That was when we saw two hunters walking up the hill, the same way we were going.  We stopped and let them go ahead of us.  They said hello, and went on up.        Because we had walked so far, we started to feel like we were lost.Then we really started getting scared.        I've always had a good since of direction, but I was getting a little worried, too.  Then I remembered that we had walked up and down two hills and when we got to the top of the third hill, we then walked down the north side of the hill to the creek.  I reassured my friends that I knew exactly where we were and that we would find our way back just fine.       That was when I saw it.  I didn't know what it was, I had never seen anything like it before.  It came down the hill about fifty feet to the left of where the two hunters had just gone up.  It stood two feet taller than the men we had just seen.  It's whole body was dark brown, like it was covered with fur.  At first I thought it was a bear, but It didn't walk like a bear.  It walked like a man, upright and swinging it's long arms.  I remember the top of it's head looked flat like it had a top hat on, the kind that Abraham Lincoln would have worn.  It moved quickly and quietly and in no time at all, it had come down the hill and crossed the creek.  The same creek we had taken several steps to cross, it crossed with just one step.  It disappeared into the trees so fast, that I was the only one to see him.  I was so shocked that I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there with my mouth hanging open until he was gone.  But I never felt afraid the whole time.       When we got back to camp, my dad had just came back to camp from hunting all morning.  I told him all about what I had seen and he said that he had been on the other side of the creek around the same time that we were there, which was around 12:00 PM.  He said that he didn't see anything but he heard a loud sound like a large wounded animal breathing real heavy.  The same sound that he had heard several years before on another hunting trip at a place called Brush Creek.  Then he made the sound for me.  It gave me chills.  It sounded asthmatic, like loud moaning breathes.  He admitted to me that he was very afraid both times he had heard it, even though he was standing there with a deer rifle in his hands.       A few years later, my family and I were watching T V and a program came on about Bigfoot.  It was suppose to have actual footage of a real Big foot.  I had heard of the legend of Bigfoot, but I always thought that it was just that, a legend.        When I saw the footage,  I got those same chills all over again.  I jumped up and yelled ""That's it, that's what I saw!""  It looked just like what I had seen, except they said that the one on T V was a female because it had breasts.  The one I saw didn't and it looked taller, too, so I'm guessing it must have been a male.       It's been over 30 years since I saw whatever it was I saw, and I can still see it as clearly in my mind as I did then.  Whenever I tell this story to friends, they always laugh and joke around with me like I'm making it up or crazy or something.  I just tell them, ""You don't have to believe me.  I don't know what it was I saw that day either, but I do know that I saw... something!""",My father heard loud moaning sounds around the same time and place that I saw it.,"I was with two other girls, but they didn't see it.",,"12:00 pm  cool, sunny day in November.",There were a lot of trees without leaves.

Outside of Sonora Ca. about 30 minute drive.,Pinecrest,Highway 108,"We were camping in tents with our horses tied on a rope between the trees. In the middle of the night I was awakened by a terrifying scream kind of like a woman screaming and then I heard what sounded like my horses were loose and running up the hill. I ran out of my tent to where the horses were and shined my flashlight. All my horses were tyed up and staring up at the top of the hill very upset. We didn't hear or see anything else so we went to bed. The next morning there were footprints going up the hill like whatever it was had two large feet with a big toe. The next evening at dust we tyed our horses up in the meadow. Our camp was about 300 yards away when we heard a loud sound like the horses startled something, we looked up to see some huge thing running extremely fast across the meadow away from the horses in a cloud of dust. We ran over there and one horse was so scared it had jumped over another horse while they were tied up. So we tyed the horses up in the orginal spot and never heard another thing on the trip. We stayed a week and we felt very stange like something was watching us. There were no animals in the area no birds, squirrels etc etc. We were in the middle of nowhere and we would hike around our camp and there would be stacked rocks little bunches all around the area and the next day they would gone. This went on through out the week and one day we smelt this odor that was so bad around our tent when we came back from a ride but we never saw anything else. This went on for two years that we returned to the exact camping spot. Then one year we were camping and we didn't feel that same strange feeling we had that someone was watching us, there were birds squirrels insects all kinds of signs of life.

Forrest,Alturas,Hwy 299,"In 1974, I purchased an arce of land in northern CA in a place called California Pines, a very remote area bordered on 3 sides by a national forest (Modoc Nat. Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead.   Along about 10 or 11 pm, the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am, I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond, I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached, the moonlite was very bright, I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion, because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me, he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself, I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks, but all I found was crushed cat tails, an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down, and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping.

06017,323,1055,1993,Spring,April,CA,El Dorado County,The north end of Aloha Lake in Desolation Wilderness ,Twin Bridges,Highway 50," First I would like to say that I'm very reluctant to tell this to anyone. I didn't report this because I thought the park service would think we were nuts, and I new of no other source that would take it seriously. I also didn't think the location of my sighting was one where other sightings had accrued until I used your sightings map.  It was April 1993 when I went hiking in Desolation Wilderness with two of my friends for a bachelor weekend. We started out at the Horse Shoe Falls trailhead at Twin Bridges off of HW50 and hiked up to Lake Aloha. It was very hot going up the falls so we were very surprised to se all the snow at the top (that year we had some late snowstorms). We were disappointed because the lake still had a lot of ice on it, but not enough to walk on. We tried to walk around the lake but the deep snow and steep sides male it unappeasable.   We set up camp at the south end of the lake 200 yards west of the trail near a picnic bench. We were the only ones up there that fare in except some one that went up the southern slope of eastern mountain. There was no other tracks going around the lake and to my knowledge the back way in was to far to hike in those conditions.  Trevor and I woke up early  (near sun up) to try to fish in one of the unfrozen spots near the bank, but it had frozen over that night. We were looking over the lake when we noticed some one on the other side of the lake walking around. We watched him because we didn't think there was a way around the lake and were curious how he got there.  That's when it walked by the picnic table across the lake and we noticed that it was a lot larger than we were judging were the table came to on it's leg compared to were our picnic table came to on us (I'm 6ft and Trevor is 6.1ft). That's when we got out the binoculars and took a better look. We couldn't ses any detail of its face but its whole body looked dark brown to black.  We were arguing about what we were looking at because we didn't want to believe what were looking at. At first we thought it was a bear but it walk to well on its back feet. We thought it was a hiker but it was not quite walking like a man (judging the long strides by the bench, we could not walk like that comfortley) and how easily it moved across the snow.   We went over to the tent to wake up Rob and show him but by the time we got back, he was gone. About 15min. later a lone hiker came down the southern slope of the eastern mountain into our camp and we asked him if he saw any thing on the other side of the lake and he said he watched some thing walking near the lake and then leave out through the north west side. We asked him if he saw any way we could get to that side and he said he could not see a way over. We told him about what we saw and he noticed the same thing (but not the same detail) we did.   The sighting was about 10 minutes or so, and has left us a lot to think about. I don't know if it was a Big Foot or not, but after watching the famous video of the Big Foot walking, I noticed that that's the strange way we saw the ""thing"" moving.   ",,3,,6am aprox.

06093,324,1058,1984,Summer,August,CA,Siskiyou County,,"Forks of Salmon, CA",,"Dear BFRO,  I had an interesting and very frightening experience back in 1984. I was backpacking with two friends in the Marble Mountains Wilderness in Siskyou County, Northern California. We were camped by a lake in the southern portion of the wilderness about 20 miles from the Klamath River east of Somes Bar and north of Fork of Salmon.  It was just after dusk and we were settling down for the evening, having spent the day hiking and fishing. We heard the sound of a tree limb break about 50 yards from camp. At first we thought we heard a black bear attempting to steal our food, which was in a nearby tree hanging in a bear bag. When we approached the tree, a friend noticed two amber-colored eyes staring at us from the woods up the hill. The eyes were reflecting the light of his flashlight. We watched it and it watched us for about a minute. Assuming it was a bear or deer, I tossed a rock in its direction, hoping to scare it away. The eyes then rose vertically several feet, as if the animal stood up from a crouched position or reared up on its hind legs. Realizing this was a large animal, presumably a bear, we paused a moment and then I threw another rock at it. This time the creature began walking down the hill toward us on its hind legs, taking alarmingly large strides. I am an environmental engineer with a pretty good background in wildlife biology and had encountered bears many times in the past. I had never seen a bear walk on its hind legs like that - down a hill strewn with fallen trees and large rocks. This thing was very agile and moved quickly toward us. Alarmed, we ran back to our campfire to alert another friend.  After a minute or two, my buddy again caught the eyes in his flashlight just outside our camp about 30 feet away - just outside the area illuminated by our campfire. The animal then proceeded to observe us for about 3 hours, circling our camp, but always remaining far enough away from the fire that we couldn't clearly see it or photograph it. It took large strides on its hind legs and stood approximately 7 to 8 feet tall, judging by its height relative to trees it stood by. The thing kept circling around watching our every move and would not leave, despite our shouting and noise making. It was extremely unnerving because we were about 12 miles from our car in the middle of a very remote wilderness, in the pitch black darkness of night, with no weapons to defend ourselves. Had this thing attacked, we were more or less defenseless with no help for miles around. Interestingly, it kept its distance and was not really threatening us. It seemed more curious than anything else. I felt more or less like an animal being observed in a zoo exhibit. Usually, a bear will enter your camp and sniff out your food/kitchen. This creature kept its distance and remained walking on its hind legs the whole time, which bears do not do. The animal's demeanor seemed more curious than menacing.  The thing never made a sound, which would have helped us identify it or confirm our fears that it was not a bear and was indeed a bigfoot. In desperation, I threw some camping fuel on our fire, which released a huge ball of flame and a blinding flash of light. This must have scared the thing away, because when the fire subsided, it was gone. The next morning we checked for footprints, droppings, and any other sign that could indicate what it was. I suppose the hard, dry ground wasn't suitable because we didn't find any discernable tracks, which was really dissapointing. Thus, I can't prove with photographs or casts of footprints that we really saw a bigfoot, but, aside from a large and very agile bear, I can't explain what it was. This was a really intense experience and is the honest truth!   My buddies and I have vowed to return to that lake with battery powered spotlights and better camera equipment again sometime and see if we enconter this creature again. Hopefully, if we are lucky enough to see it (or its offspring) again, we will get photos to prove it. I would very much like to see the scientific community officially identify and recognize this animal as a true North American species. I am no longer a skeptic. I would be happy to answer any further questions, see contact info below.

",Fresno,cant recall,"gentlemen, here is my account of what i remember. fresno, ca. 1995. mono creek camp ground. about 12 or 14 miles above lake huntington. in the sierras. myself, my fishing pardner, and another gentleman, were all fishing a small part of the river there, it was the last weekend of the season, before they close the roads, due to snow. about 3 miles down the river, my pardner decided he had enough, and stop to nap. this other gentleman and myself pushed on, maybe 3/4 of mile from where we had left my friend. i stop to fish a pool. the other guy  dropped down to the next pool, to fish it, that is how we were working the differant areas. 1 guy would stop to fish a hole and the other would go right down below. as i was fishing my little stretch, i noticed the guy coming back up, he looked very excited and was waving for me to come there, i figured that he landed a good fish, or had seen a bear. he was almost in a frenzy, he just told me to hurry when i caught up to him he was looking over the edge of the next little drop off, i looked over and saw nothing unusual, he said it was right there, and jumped his way down to the spot, i followed, asking him what he had seen. before i could even get the words out of my mouth this smell, i cant explain to you what it was, wet, moldy, well animal, musk filled the air, nothing i have smelled ever was like this. my friend then told me that he had seen it, again before i could even ask above us i saw it, there standing no more then i would say 25 yards up the hill, was a the creature i believe to be a bigfoot. about 8 foot tall, covered in a reddish brown, and some what black hair, the face i remember it looking almost humanoid in appearance. it then turned and began taking huge strides up the mountain, not running, but covering some serious ground.on 2 feet. not 4. i tried to follow it, but again i felt an almost hynotic sensation over take me, and my pardner later told me he felt the same way, and  i couldnt move, we watched it go right up to the top and over it. i felt very over whelmed, and did not say anything to my friend, we just walk in a silence back to our other friend, he could tell we were shooken up. but never let him in on what had just occured. to this day, when ever i think about it, i get overwelmed with emotion. when i got home i called the gentleman and talked to him about what we had seen, the feelings we went through were basically the same, when he saw the creature he said he could smell the smell i described, but not nearly as bad as when we came down to where it had been standing. then a strange feeling over took him as well, almost like we were hypnotized, or drugged. he has trouble now remembering what he looked liked, he can remember seeing it and the smell, but all other memeories are fading. i can tell you , i will never forget what he looked like, and have came to my own conclusions, i believe the smell the bigfoot emits can be used as sort of a defense system, let me explain, i believe when excited or scared the aroma he emits can actually work on a persons system, maybe for one, it makes you feel drugged, or for another it makes you feel hypnotized or just plain scared. the reason i feel this way, is like i said to this day, when i think about it, i am over come with emotion., i hope this might help in some small way, thank you for your time."," i did notice no animals, no sounds, no nothing, i had been saying that a couple miles into our trip down river, i always make sure to look for wildlife and there was none. and up there i always see and hear quite a few things.  after the sighting a very tranquil feeling came over me, like it was going to be just fine. or a weird calmness. when ever i think about it, i cry, or become teary eyed. overwhelmed with emotion.",2 and he was fishing.,"never asked about any, never was told of any.","about 2 p.m., very well lit canyon","small river winding down a steep, hilling, rocky, wooded canyon",29
06109,341,1090,1978/79,Summer,August,CA,Tuolumne County,The campground has grown quite a bit since 1978-79.  I went back to check out the area a few months ago and was surprised to see how much it had changed.  It is now more like a mobile home park towards the back where we had camped.  The homes are very close together and I could not see a way without trespassing to get back to the area where I had entered the forest.,Twain Harte,Off Hwy 108,"Around the age of 12 or 13 (I'm 34 now) I went with my parents to Sugerpine Campground in the Sonora/Twain Harte area in California.  We were there for two weeks in our 21' travel trailer, and I was completely bored out of my mind!  I also had just started menstruating for the first time while we were in the middle of our trip  (mentioning this seems weird, but will make sense later). At the campground I met a little girl, a few years younger.  She had been living there with her parents who were without a home.  She showed me a trail that went way out into the woods where there was a small stream (only a few feet wide) with a big rock.  If you climbed up on top of the big rock, there was a tree branch that you could grab onto and swing over the stream.  We played there for a good while and returned to the campground when it started getting dark.  The next day I looked for my friend, but she had apparently moved on with her family - her campsite was empty.  I figured I'd go back out to the stream and play for awhile since I had nothing better to do.  The stream and rock area was a little further than a city block out into the dense forest.  The whole trail was shaded since the pines were so thick.  I merrily went out into the woods, with absolutely no hesitation, looking forward to some fun.  When I got within about 5' to 6' from the big rock I had the strange feeling someone was watching me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up a bit. I still was not afraid and began looking around me (thinking maybe my friend was out there playing somewhere close by and hadn't left as I had thought).  I looked in front of me and slowly turned counter-clockwise peering into the dense woods.  I continued turning until I was looking directly down the small footpath I just walked to the rock.  As I looked at the pathway, I noticed a very large pine tree that was edging the path had a funny looking ""arm thing"" wrapped around it's middle.  I looked - still not afraid - and was trying to figure out what the heck it was; I could make out long fingers and very dark furry brown hair covering the entire ""arm"".  I thought to myself ""that's not a branch, and it's not a bear's paw, it sure looks like a HAND!""  Now, this tree was approximately 15' from where I was standing, and DIRECTLY next to the pathway I had just come from.  As I continued to look at the ""arm"" - still not afraid since in my own mind I kept thinking it couldn't POSSIBLY be an arm even though it sure looked exactly like one...I saw a face peek out from the opposite side of the tree and look at me.  It was a very flat face, very dark brown - couldn't make out any features except the eyes, which were looking right at me!  Let me tell you, I was never very athletic, but as soon as we made eye contact I don't think my feet touched the ground!  Worse yet, I had to run right BY IT to get the heck outta there!  I FLEW back to camp and ran into the trailer.  I didn't tell my mom or dad about it since I thought they'd think I was crazy.  Needless to say, I stayed in that trailer for the rest of our vacation at Sugarpine. When I mention I started my period for the first time, I believe animals have an uncanny ability to sense and smell those types of things, maybe it caught wind of me and decided to follow and check me out.  The creature was hunched over a bit, so it's hard to tell exactly how tall it was, or if it was a juvenile.  I do know that the pine tree it had it's arm wrapped around was around 4' wide in circumference - which makes it a pretty long arm!  Another thing to mention is that I don't remember smelling anything. ","While camping at Sugerpine I had heard that a child had disappeared recently; kidnapped from the campground and nobody knew what happened to him/her.  My brother checked the newspaper archives in that area just a few months back to try and find any further information, but could not locate anything to substantiate this. It did make me wonder though.....",I was alone.  Just minding my own business!,None.,"Happened approximately between 10am and 2pm.  Area was shady, but very clear.

06103,352,1114,1994,Summer,August,CA,Tehama County,"We were driving on county road A6, off of Hwy 36 between Dales and Manton, in Tehama County.  ",Between Manton and Payne's Creek,We were on the county road at the time,"I was driving home (see details, below) with my son and daughter late at night.  Suddenly an ape crossed the road with incredible speed.  We all three saw it.  We had been talking excitedly about who knows what, all very alert, all eyes on the road, when this occurred.  Our conversation came to a complete halt.  All three of us had to process what we had just seen, we just couldn't believe our eyes.  This was an ape-like animal, about the size of a large chimpanzee, traveling across the road with what can only be described as lightening speed.  It disappeared on the other side of the road as if it had disappeared into another dimension--almost swallowed up by the night so to speak.  It was on its knuckles, more or less, the way apes run.  This was apparent to all three of us, we are all fairly intelligent people with a wide variety of experience with animals.  We have lived in the woods for 20+ years in Manton in Tehama County and have all seen mountain lions, bears, racoons, otters, fisher, ringtails, raccoons, etc. and this was nothing like any of those animals.  We all three had the same experience, we all three agreed that what we had just seen had to be some kind of primate.  And we all three had never seen anything move like that before in our lives.  After some discussion we agreed that it might be a young Sasquatch.  In the days ahead I got some literature about Bigfoot at the library, and we have determined that it may very well have been a Bigfoot sighting.   ","Well, we were in kind of a funny state of mind, as I said, just a little hyped up.  Or, to put it another way, we were perhaps hyper-alert.  It was pitch black on this road, which is usually quite deserted, and late at night like this there was not another soul around.  This is a very isolated area.  ","In the car with me was my son and my daughter.  We were all three wide awake, having drank some coffee to keep awake.  We had been on a jet returning from Florida visiting other family members.  WE got in our car in Sacramento and drove all the way home, another 3 hours.  We were kind of keyed up.  We were talking excitedly with one another, just enjoying being on the road home again.

The year was approximately 1955, plus or minus one year. I was about eleven years old, and on a boy scout camping trip. Although this happened to me a long time back, I now can remember it clearly. I say now because for along time I blocked it out of my mind. Sometime in the early morning hours I left the tent to visit the latrine, which was maybe fifty yards away at the edge of a small ravine. As I was standing there relieving myself I began to hear small limbs and heavy brush breaking just on the other side of the ravine. My first thought was that a steer or cow was over there, and I quickly directed my flashlight beam in the direction of the sounds. What I saw Froze me in terror. It looked to be about seven maybe eight feet tall, covered with long shaggy brown hair and kind of teetering back and forth on it's two feet. The head was very large with no neck to be seen, and the eyes about ten to twelve inches apart,with round glowing orange appearance. The arms were very long, and hung straight down. I turned and ran back to the tent, wetting myself all the way. Everyone that I tried to relate this incident to just laughed at me, including my own family. Finally I just told myself that it didn't really happen. Thats how I left it untill one day a few years ago I picked up ""The Bigfoot Case History Book"", and while paging through it, suddenly there was the picture of what I saw so many years ago.

I hesitate because for many years now I've attributed what I saw to an often-active imagination and ""trick"" of light.  Let me explain.  When I was approx. 11 or 12 years old (1978 or '79)I was walking through the woods with my younger brother and friend behind the California Dept of Fish and Game patrol cabin across from the Boulder Flats camp ground, Hwy 108 in Tuolumne County about 50 miles or so east of Sonora.  My father is a retired DFG patrol captain and we'd vacation there several times a year.  All we were doing was walking through the woods several hundred yards from the cabin when we saw what looked like a conical-shaped head, brown in color with deep set eyes peering at us from behind a tree approx.100-120 feet away slightly uphill from where we were standing. That's all.  I still remember that I stood there telling myself that it must be a tree branch stump glinting in the afternoon sun (it was a bright day as I remember).  It didn't move and we stood looking at it for what must have been at least a minute. My brother then became upset and we ran from the area as fast as we could.  I still don't know what I saw and you probably won't find this very interesting but, having read similar accounts of purported sasquatch remaining motinless while observing/ being observed, I have to wonder.","Nothing else seen, smelled or heard.",3 witnesses (kids age 11-12 and 7 or 8 years) walking and playing in forest.,"Having just read accounts on your web page, there are more than I suspected occuring in this area of the country.

At approx 9:30-10:00 I stopped for gas in a small town just north of Redding, CA. I departed and continued heading north to Edgewood. I was searching for another exit, one with food, however I didn't find one, so I exited and drove out about 1-2 miles on a paved highway that turned into dirt without warning. (Off Edgewood road). I pulled my car over, and got out some food I had taken incase I couldn't find a restaraunt. I proceeded to eat, and take a short nap. I awoke about 1:30AM to the sound of something hitting my car from what I thought to be the front. I got out to look around and found a rock had hit my vehicle in the hood area. I found this very odd, and thought maybe some kids were playing around. I re-entered my vehicle, started it up again, turned on the lights, and to my utter surprise infront of me was a creature (for lack of a better term) just in the range of my headlights. Apparently it had been there watching me walk outside the vehicle and didn't move or make a sound. It seemed uninterested in me, then suddenly turned and started to move away (left) into a small brushy area. I would have to estimate it at 7'0 to 8'0 tall, somewhat of a chocolate color, and very mobile for its size. It did not seem awkward by any means. I was not sure what to do, so I locked the doors and waited until I got my bearings together again. I got back on the highway and used my cell farther up the road to try and call CHP. When I reached them, I was unsure of how to explain this.

It was late october and the other ranch hands had left for the season, leaving my cousin and I to close up the ranch for the winter, there where no other people around the area. The summer backpackers had all gone. It was around dusk when we heard a noise, it started out as a low rumble, we almost felt it before we heard it.  But it then rose in volume and pich. it was like a babbling scream. It could almost sound like words, the screem lasted at least 30 seconds or more then rose to a shreak and ended abruptly.  It sounded as though it came from a point 50 or so yards from where we were standing, a thick grove of trees and deadfalls we call the island.  I could hear something moving in the trees and starting to circle the meadow we were in. IT screamed again and sounded as though it had moved to our right.  My cousin and I were shaken by the noise and we ran for the cook house. Sitting inside we heard it again and it sounded as  though it was now in the medow below us, but the darkness made it imposible to see anything. At this time we moved from the cooks cabin to a building we call the winter room.  We locked the door and spent the night there ( the room is bear proof and therefore safe). We heard it maybe five more times, around the ranch and once I was woken up at maybe three in the morning, by something outside our room. The next day I searched for tracks but the ground was frozen though it hadn't snowed yet. We found no tracks, but there was a hand print on the door of a store room where we keep food from bears during the summer.

I haven't been back to this area since the mid 80's so I don't know how much has changed.",Nearest town would be Lee Vining,Above Hwy 395,"This happened about 24 years ago, but it is still fresh in my mind (I guess you never really forget these type of experiences). It was late July of 1977. My family was up in the eastern Sierras, near Mono Lake, approx 13-15 miles above Conway Summit in an area known as Virginia Lakes. My dad told my brother and I to go to the lake and gather firewood. It was late in the day and the sun was down but it wasn't dark yet, only dusk. I was 14 yrs old and my brother was 1 month shy of 16. He had his learners permit so we were allowed to take the truck. We got to the lake and started loading up some wood. I had just returned to the truck and dropped the wood when I heard, what I thought, was someone walking through the brush. The foot falls were very heavy, almost like someone was jumping, but the steps seemed pretty rapidly placed. Where we were gathering wood was near a large hedge of bushes, approx 6 to 7 feet high and very dense with only 1 path through the bush to skirt the lake without wading in the water. I turned to the bushes, where the sound was coming from, and saw the bushes shaking and bending, as if something large was moving through the bushes, making a lot of noise. I watched for a few seconds when my brother came running to the truck, white as a ghost and eyes bulging wide. I said,""Jeff, what was that?"" He was scared and out of breath. ""I don't know, but let's get out of here."" he said. We jumped back into the truck and drove all out. On the way back to the camp, he told me that he was only 10 or 15 feet away from it. He heard the stomping and crashing of the brush, and turned to see a large, dark-brown head above the bushes moving rapidly away from him. He didn't see the face.  He was so scared, he crashed the truck into a tree on the way back to camp. My dad was pretty pissed, to say the least, and didn't believe our story, even when we were crying because of how frightened we were. He finally calmed down and said that we probably saw a bear. But, bears do not walk through heavy brush on 2 legs. And my brother swore that it was not a bear. I think my dad started to believe that we saw something since we both would not go out to the camp fire that night, and both of us refused to go to the lake alone for the rest of the trip. Since that time, I have told several people with very few people actually believing me. Most told me that big foot are only in the north-west in Oregan/Washington.

The previous renter worked for a company that had her out of town frequently, so I am not sure on any encounters she may or may not have had.  We had 4 large dogs and one of my chores was feeding and watering them daily. Two of our dogs were german sheppard/husky, which were tied on a runner that was connected to the top of the house and a tree about 20 yards away.  We were the only house on that side of the highway, our nearest neighbors being across the highwahy maybe another mile away.The other two dogs that we had were a german short hair and a griffin, those two were tied up down in front of our house by our vehicles, one of which barked constantly.  The one thing that we could not figure out was why every day and evening the dogs water - a 5 gallon buckets were constantly empty. We did not see any occasions where the buckets had tipped over, so that was one conclusion we discarded. Another occurance was the fact that the dogs would not come out of their doghouses after dark, which was odd.  We did not have running water in the house, so we had to use an outhouse, which was about 10 yards away from the back door. After several alarming incidents where my mom and I  would make our trip to the outhouse before bed, we were aware of the sounds around us, usually stopping for no apparent reason. Then the frequent feeling of being watched, and the hairs on the back of our necks would prickle, leaving us no choice but to stop our visits after dark.  There was one incident in which my step-dad was up late around 2 or 3 in the morning and he visited the outhouse where he heard the unmistakeable sound of something very large, on two legs approaching, through 3-5 foot high thick brush which is only accessable with a machetti. The creature was grunting in a gutteral, deep sound that communicated aggression to my step-dad. He felt severly threatened by this creature and began running to the house, hearing it follow just below the trail. There were no bears I can assure you.  Another incident was the unmistakeable communication between three creatures, one above the house and two below in the brush. The calls were loud shrill whistles and chirps, then low gutteral  grunts. One would call, then two would answer.  The last incident was while my mom and I were looking for one of the dogs that had been gone for a few days, we walked about 300 yards down below the house on a trail that led to an over look where you could see the bottom of the canyon, very beautiful. I seen a some indention by a large rock that looked like a trail, so we thought if we could go further down the mountain side, we might be able to call for the dog.  Well, this trail led down a very steep coulie that had a few taller trees in it, and a rather sheer wall that was then turned inward toward the ground creating a type of shelter/cave. Under this overhang were three deep impressions that looked to be beds, scooped out and shallow with foot prints aound them in the loose powdery dirt. This really raised the hackles on our necks, and looking at eachother we quickly ran up to the house, so unnerved by this find. Thses incidents did not result in any photos, but definately a belief in the existence of Bigfoot.",not that we can conclude,"because there were several incidents, the times were often different.

One day in the fall, I was staring out my living room window (it faced the woods), and I noticed something really big and hairy. It was standing up on two feet, and dark brown in color. It was about 25 feet away from the window. The creature walked right in between two trees that faced my living room window and just stood there and stared at me. I didn't even think of moving. It stood there for a while, it was probably five minutes or so, but back then those five minutes felt like forever! Then it just turned around and walked back into the woods. I know that it wasn't a bear because it did it all on two feet. I still remember all this and it happened a long time ago. I did tell my mom but she said that I probably saw a bear, but I know it was not a bear.",,,,,,
06015,596,1551,1985,Fall,December,CA,Del Norte County,Off Highway 199 just south of the Oregon border. Also Avenue of the Giants off Hwy 101 Humboldt County California.,,,"A friend and I went driving to camp in Oregon on Hwy 199 in the fall of 1985. We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two malamute cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many backcountry adventures.  As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep.  Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from ""childlike"" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat. party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I've had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning.  The second ""experience"" I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the samefriend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going crosscountry through the dense redwood forest.  Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below. Above us on the length of ground the dog drug us through, braches were snapped off clean up to 10 feet high on the trees. We made our way back to the main trail with no further incident.","The most striking thing was the odd behaviour of the dog(s). Anyone who has owned a malamute knows they are very bold dogs that basically aren't afraid of anything especially when there's more than one. When the dogs (near Oregon) tried to claw their way into the tent, it sent shivers up my spine and I must say I didn't get much sleep that night. Again, with the incident at Richardson Grove, the dog actually stood up on its hindlegs and ""walked"" while lunging forward up a steep bank dragging my friend who weighed about 170 lbs with it in its pursuit of the thing that left big footprints. Never had that dog do that before or since in spite of many wilderness adventures, bear, elk, deer etc. encounters.",One witness besides myself.,,First incident was about late October 1985. Second incident was early December 1985.,"First incident it was dense mixed forest of madrone, fir etc near a small creek at a low elevation, maybe 1000 feet, off Highway 199 about 10 miles south of the Oregon border.

06015,603,1563,1967,Fall,October,CA,Del Norte County,,,,"THE PATTERSON / GIMLIN FOOTAGE  The Patterson/Gimlin footage is a short piece of 16mm film obtained by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin in 1967. It was obtained in the remote canyon of Bluff Creek, California, very close to the border of Del Norte County and Humboldt County.  Both Patterson and Gimlin lived near Yakima, Washington. Patterson had been trying to obtain film footage of a bigfoot for many years. During the period he had also written a book entitled, ""Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?"" He hoped some decent film footage would help answer that question.   In this book he calls attention to the unusually large amount of testimonial and circumstantial evidence pointing to the existence of large, forest-dwelling primate species in North America.   Bob Gimlin, a highly experienced outdoorsman, was a close friend of Patterson. He accompanied Patterson on several horsepacking expeditions in pursuit of film footage.   Equipped with a 16mm hand-held Kodak movie camera, the two set out in October, 1967 for a horsepacking trip in northwest California. Their search focused on the Bluff Creek area, because a number of tracks had been found there in prior years while logging roads were being built. Road construction workers had noticed large human-like footprints on the soft exposed soil of the new roads. The tracks were first reported to the press by construction worker Jerry Crew in October, 1958.   A local newspaper reporter came up with the name ""Bigfoot"" to describe the maker of the largest tracks. Tracks of six different individuals were repeatedly found on the new logging roads. The sizes ranged from 12.25 inches long to 17 inches long.   In the early afternoon of October 20, 1967 as Patterson and Gimlin, on horseback, followed a trail in the creek bottom, they spotted a bigfoot apparently drinking from the creek. Patterson's horse reared in alarm as the bigfoot stood up and began to walk away. Both the horse and Patterson fell to the ground, with Patterson briefly pinned by the fallen horse. Patterson quickly worked himself free and grabbed his hand-held movie camera.   While running toward the retreating bigfoot, Patterson shot 24 feet of film. Gimlin sat ready with his rifle in hand.  Not wanting another spooked confrontation with this bigfoot, Patterson and Gimlin decided not to pursue it into the forest. At that point they felt they had the footage they came for anyway.   After the footage was brought back to town and developed, a handful of investigators from the US and Canada returned to the film site and measured the tracks and other objects to help accurately gauge the size of the figure in the footage. The calculations suggested a height of 7 foot, 3.5 inches. The footprints were 14.5 inches long by 6 inches wide.",,,,,,20

It sounded like it was mad at me and kept moving to my right trying to get down wind of me. I figured that my very powerful Aircraft Landing Light that I was using to hunt with must have blinded him and hurt his eyes because as he was circling me trying to wind me he never looked my way thus allowing me to catch his glowing eyes.   ,,Only my brother who was my hunting partner that night.

Access is easiest from Mosquito Lake which is due south. About a four hour light hike on granite outcrops that cut a path through the buck brush and Jeffrey pine.,Callahan,State Hwy 3,"I was working as a councilor at wilderness summer camp based at Mosquito Lake. Several councilors would sign up each session for excursions on  1 to 3 nights away in the back country. This hike was during the second session in early July. We had completed the major stretch of the four hour journey when we came over the ridge and could see East Boulder about 3/4 of a mile below.  There were 4 councilors and about 25 boys and girls ranging in age from 9 through 15. We had stopped for a last gulp of water at a clearing just below the rim of the ridge when several of the campers began to squeal excitedly and pointing at the steep slope directly to the northeast and to the right of us. Not more than 50 feet away at the same elevation stood an erect hairy creature looking right back at us. One of the kids yelped, ""It's a bear!"" Tim, one of the councilors, muttered, ""That's no bear.""  The details are still vivin in my memory. The creature was leaning against its left arm which pushed it out from the canyon wall. The right arm swung back and forth as if for balance and it bobed its head irregularly. It was about 5'6"" tall, covered with long reddish brown fur with a large flat face and round yellow eyes. During a discussion later, Sunny, who was studying biology at UC Davis, insisted that she observed the creature to have a hairless chest with large round protruding nipples. This led her to conclude that it was possibly female.  The creature held its ground for a little over 1 minute before it spun around and ran away from out group upward towards the rim to the right of us. As it ran it sent a landslide of skree down into the valley below. When it reached the ridge it turned and peered back at us once again and then disappeared over the edge.  Much excitement followed and the decision to continue down to the lake and set up camp was made. Curiously, there didn't seem to be a trace of fear among the children although all the councilors, myself included, did admit later to being afraid.  The first thing after dark that I noticed was a powerful odor that came from the Ponderosa grove. The closest comparison I can come up with is that the smell is skunk like but muskier with a hint of urine. The entire camp began to get a whiff of this odor and the animated discussion about the sighting during the afternoon became hushed. In the quiet we could hear landslides from a number of different places midway up the ridge, a dim green light about the size of a small grapefruit. The odor intensified and the snapping of branches not more than 10 yards away sent the whole bunch of us into a cluster around the fire. The odor was intense when a large shadow figure took several long deliberate strides through a gap in the trees. It had to be about 7 feet tall. I saw this creature only once but others in the group saw several dark forms over the next 2 hours.  Shortly after midnight an 11 year old boy in the group began to complain of great pain in his lower abdomen. This pain increased over the next hour to the point that he was laying on the ground pulling his legs up towards his chest. The councilors agreed that it appeared that the camper was having an appendicitis attack. We drew sticks and Larry and Tim headed out in the dark back to the main camp to bring a stretcher with a four wheel drive truck to the logging road just over the south ridge. Sunny and I remained with the group, some of them sleeping and others tending the campfire. At the point when Tim and Larry's flashlights were no longer visible, the odor departed as well and the night became still and quiet.  The next morning shortly after dawm, Tim Larry and Warren, the camp director, arrived at the camp with a olive green military stretcher.  Warren would later question every member of the group. He observed that the key elements of the story were consistent in each telling. He conceded that we had indeed experienced something strange but insisted that the concilors present agree to the possibility that what we had seen were bears. ",The green lights remain a mystery.  This definately appeared to be a group or family. In my opinion they meant no harm and were genuinely curious about the children. They did not make any loud screame or stomp as reported in other sightings. They did not appear to want to scare the kids.

The basin surrounding the lake is used as grazing land for cattle with scrub oak along the western shore line of the lake and a dense grove of Ponderosa that runs along the base of the steep western rim.

I think the area is intended for day use only. well, we stopped and took a walk down this trail just to take in some of the scenery when about 200 yards down the trail my wife began to get this feeling something was off to the right. I told her it was her imagination when all of a sudden from that direction came this yell or howl that made my skin crawl. It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled. The howl itself sounded halfway between a human voice yelling ""Ahhhhhh"" and the high pitched sound of an elk. It wasn't an elk or human or bear as near as I can tell though and what ever it was moved very fast. We didn't see anything though but we got the distinct feeling weren't welcome in the area. As it seemed to get to what seemed to be around 75 yards away we ran back to the car and promptly left. We never could figure it out so we just dropped the subject. My ex is a superstitious sort and at first started trying to explain it away as a ghost which me want to drop the subject even quicker. But the issue has always unsettled me and when I heard some of the recordings of bigfoot screams on this or some other b.f. website, one in particular was exactly like what I heard that day. I still don't know what it was of !! or sure but I'll never forget it ",very thick redwood forest with a lot ferns at least in the area we were in.,8 th.

We arrived in late afternoon, met the lady that wanted to sell it. We entered a fenced area w/a large gate. The area was about thirty feet across [hard packed red clay], w/ an old shed to the right against some manzanita brush. To the right was a trail through the brush leading to a cabin [unoccupied for years] and unfinished. It was built against the side off a hill where you could walk into it from the trail but when you looked out the window off the main room it was about a forty-foot drop [it was partially on stilts] to the ground. I am an outdoors person, hunter, fishing, hiking, etc., but I didnt feel good about this place. We had trouble starting the trike and I recommended leaving it, but my friend wanted it badly and the lady persuaded him to stay the night in the cabin and she would rent a trailer the next day. We went to Sonora for dinner and came back about 8:00 pm. We pulled into the gate [the lady lived about an eighth of a mile up the mountain in a mobile home]. As we exited the 1951 GMC P.U. and walked towards the trail, the brush to the right of it parted and out stepped this huge figure, like a man but taller [we are both 6 feet tall] and wider. It was a dark night but it was darker than the brush and silhouetted very well. It was about ten to twelve feet away and looked right at us. My friend jumped into the truck and I pulled my bowie knife out and swept it back and forth as I backed onto the hood of the truck w/out turning away from it. It casually turned to its left and started across the clearing towards the shed. As it moved it partially turned its head/torso towards me and made a ""huff"" noise, arms swinging as it crossed the thirty feet in about four strides, turning away from us. We spent a sleepless night in the cabin, as the door didnt have a knob or lock.",,,,,,25

During the late summer of 1986 my wife Mary and I were driving east on highway 50 heading toward Lake Tahoe at about 11:30 p.m. We were about 25 to 30 miles west of Lake Tahoe when we approached an S-curve.

While making the right turn however, our headlights were facing the side of a hill and something else, we were not prepared for.  About 40 yards directly in front of us, we saw a huge hairy man-like creature walking along the side of this hill at the roadside. Our headlights were directly on it and there was no mistaking what we saw at that distance, as we made the left turn away from the hill the thing disappeared in the darkness.  My wife and I stared off ahead, and as we drove a short distance, both turned to look at each other and we said, ""Did you see that?"" I knew I hadn't imagined it, because she saw it too.

This was the last privately owned 40 acres before Bureau of Land Management land. Very rugged terrain. The night of the Perseids meteor shower in August in 1981.",,,"There was about 10 of us watching the Perseids meteor shower from a clearing near an area where we were building a small cabin. Previously that summer we had heard some moanings or low growlings up on the top edge of the property coming from the uncut Bureau of Land Management forest, but did not think much of it.  Everybody else got tired of watching the meteor shower (it was spectacular!!!) and went back to the cabin site. I was alone laying on my back in a clearing about 100 yards from camp at about midnight, looking up at the stars and admiring the shower when I had the feeling of another presence. This seems to be a common phrase in these situations but I have to say that this feeling of being watched is something I never felt before or after. Makes you wonder about some sort of a higher lever of consciousness or something similiar (dare I say telepathic?).  I got up and cut over to a logging road that went back to camp and was about 20 yards from camp when I heard a rustling off to my right just a few feet away in dense brush. I did not even look to see what it was. I just sprinted the rest of the way back to camp and did not say anything. We were having a good time listening to loud rock and roll music (car stereo with trunk open) and drinking beer when a friend of mine said to me, ""Do you smell that ... what is it??""  Well ... I had been noticing this odor but had not said anything. It smelled like a cross between an oil refinery (very sulfurish) and had an animal musk smell to it and was VERY VERY strong. I recognized the animal muskiness from my trapping days as a youth, so I told my friend, ""This is an animal."" My friend said it smelled like diesel fuel and put out his cigarette it smelled so strong. This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it.  When we got behind the stand we couldn't smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring.  I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained. We could hear the ""hunting party"" about 50 or 60 yards up this narrow difficult trail yelling ""He's right up here ... there he is!!!!"" Then the yelling stopped for a few seconds then they started screaming. They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it. Well this freaked them out and explains their hasty retreat.  It was quiet the rest of the night but a couple of mornings later 2 of the guys were sleeping in a 2-man tent on a hillside above the camp and woke the rest of us at first light, yelling. When we got to the tent we found a huge turd about 18 inches from the front of the tent opening. It was about 4-inches in diameter and about 20 inches long and appeared to be mostly leafy material with some berry seeds. I guess that was his notice to us that he did not appreciate our company!!!  It was uneventful for the rest of the summer.","Heard some moaning growling sounds up in the forest prior. One account I have read described it as a Howler Monkey sound and I agree. I would like to touch on the sense of being watched. I feel certain that there was some sort of extra sensory faculty at work here. I was in a meditative state while alone on the hill side and was in a ""pure consciousness"" state. A state where there is no thought but just being(awarness). I was in the process of expanding my field of consciouness when I felt the other presence. I feel that this may have been a factor in this episode. Like maybe it was drawn to this awareness. Also ... I never felt fear even for a moment. I have read many other accounts and know that this sense is common with this experience.

We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two Malamute-cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many back-country adventures.  As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep.  Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from ""childlike"" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I've had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation.  We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning.  The second ""experience"" I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the same friend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the Fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going cross-country through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot-shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below. Above us on the length of ground the dog drug us through, branches were snapped off clean up to 10 feet high on the trees. We made our way back to the main trail with no further incident.","The most striking thing was the odd behaviour of the dog(s). Anyone who has owned a Malamute knows they are very bold dogs that basically aren't afraid of anything, especially when there's more than one. When the dogs (near Oregon) tried to claw their way into the tent, it sent shivers up my spine and I must say I didn't get much sleep that night. Again, with the incident at Richardson Grove, the dog actually stood up on its hindlegs and ""walked"" while lunging forward up a steep bank dragging my friend who weighed about 170 lbs with it in its pursuit of the thing that left big footprints.

We noticed that there were none of the usual sounds that you hear in a forest such as birds, etc. We still had that feeling of being watched. The sky was starting to look threatening as an afternoon storm was heading down the canyon / creek towards us.  We started back to camp when the storm caught us and lightning started. A bolt of lightning struck the ground on the other side of the creek and up a ways from our location. Directly afterwards, we heard a growling or grunting sound from the area of the strike. We heard the sound of branches breaking in the brush. The sound was moving up the creek away from us and up the mountain. The breaking branches sounded as if they were high up in the trees. The trees in the area are conifers and the dead branches started about six or more feet up the trees from ground level -- so whatever was breaking the branches, it had to be pretty tall.  The object was moving fast because it was soon out of hearing distance. You know as well as I that sound travels a long way in the woods and we were in a canyon so the object was really moving. We never noticed a foul odor or saw anything conclusive. I did, however, see a large shadow moving through the woods briefly.  Please understand that although we were very young we had a lot of experience in the back country. We knew what the indigenous animals looked like, their habits and the sounds that they make. This growling did not sound like anything that I ever heard before or since. I know that this will sound funny but a person knows when things are not quite right and this was not right. Just a feeling.  We could not return to the area to look for footprints as the lightning strike caused a fire and the camp site was evacuated by the USFS. At the time I had heard about bigfoot, but only up north. I was unaware of local sightings until recently. This thing was not a bear. I thought that at the time. I tried to make it a bear so I could put the incident out of mind, but it just doesn't add up that it was a bear unless this bear was huge, walking erect and hauling ass. It also did not sound like any bear noises that I've ever heard, not that I am a bear expert or anything.",,Hiking and fishing.,,,"Pine forest with lots of undergrowth and water.

06107,813,2183,1988,Fall,October,CA,Tulare County,"Bearpaw Meadow, California High Sierra Trail",,,"My brother and I were on backpacking trip in sometime in the mid 1980's. 1987, if my memory serves me correctly. We were hiking the High Sierra Trail from Bearpaw Meadow over the summit into the Kern River valley. We had made quite a distance the third day out (about 18 miles) and were exhausted when we stopped at a small lake called Morraine Lake high above the Kern River valley. We had seen no other hikers the entire day. As we were sitting in camp at dusk, the quiet was pierced by an unearthly screaming howl of immense volume, emanating from some distance away from us, but carrying quite clearly in the still air. It sounded as if it came from some animal with huge lung capacity, and could not be confused with human, a bear, or any other sound I had ever heard. The outburst only happened once and trailed off rather than stopping abruptly. Although clearly not human, it somehow seemed sad in tone rather than fierce or threatening.   ""Did you hear that?!"" my brother asked. ""I sure did,"" I replied. ""What do you think it was?"" he then asked. ""I have no idea,"" was my response. We were so tired that we just climbed in the tent and took our chances with whatever was out there. By morning we had forgotten about it. It remained forgotten for days until we got back to civilization and were having a meal of ""real food"" at a local diner. The newspaper I was reading carried a story about three men who were repairing a footbridge in the Golden Trout wilderness area of the Kern River for the U.S. Forest service. They were experienced woodsmen, one was a 60-year-old Mono Indian. They were frightened severely at dusk one evening by what they described as a nine-foot-tall hairy beast coming down a hillside at them screaming loudly. It was a classic Bigfoot sighting, except it was way out of the normal geographic range for sightings, since the Sierra Mountain range was not believed to be a typical Bigfoot area. They fired a shot over its head with a 30.06 rifle, and were so upset that they packed out to a Ranger Station that night and made a report to the ranger.   The ranger scoffed at them, and surmised that they had seen a bear or cougar. They replied that they knew what bear and cougars looked and sounded like, and that THIS creature was different. Way different! The ranger accompanied them the next morning to the sight and saw some large footprints in gravel, but nothing like a cast could be made from. I checked the day and place that these men said this happened and you guessed it, it was the same day that my brother and I heard this weird screaming howl, perhaps 5-8 miles away. I never reported this to anyone, but you can have this for your files and maybe if you piece enough of these small events together you can come up with a bigger picture. Good Luck!",,,,,,

I was not able to make it to dinner on time because I had a bloody nose and needed to lay down for a few minutes.  After about 5 minutes, I returned to the nearby restroom to clean up and that's when the incident occurred. What I didn't see because of high bushes between me and the sound, I did hear very clearly. I heard footsteps in the brush above the restroom. Whatever it was, was moving very slowly. I remember thinking that it was either a person walking very leisurely or something bigger walking at a normal gait. I didn't quite know what to do so, on an impulse, I made a growling sound. Then the footsteps stopped, but resumed a few seconds later. I repeated the growl and the same thing happened. Since I was alone and frankly a bit nervous since there was not supposed to be anyone else up in the woods with me at that time, I decided to go to dinner. I told some fellow campers about the incident during dinner and they were all a bit skeptical.  But after dinner we returned to the area and decided to head toward the exact spot where the footstep sounds were emanating from. I knew before seeing the footprints what I had heard since there had been stories of sightings in the area. The ground was very solid but I managed to make out several manlike footprints in the dirt, only they were much larger. My fellow campers verified what I saw. We decided to try and follow the prints, but since they were so shallow it was difficult to determine the direction the creature had taken.  But within a few minutes, our job was made easier because I once again heard the mysterious footstep noise. This time a fellow camper and myself decided to chase the creature making the noise so we took off running in the direction of the noise. After about a minute of running uphill, I brought us to a halt to listen. We now heard the creature running away from us very quickly. We pursued it for a few more minutes, but the only thing we found was one set of toe-prints in the area where the creature had been running from us.

06045,819,2199,1977,Unknown,,CA,Mendocino County,,,,"Well, I think it was 1977. I was squatting in the woods out by a little lake road of Mendocino, California. I've spent most of my life in the woods of California or Maine. Even had resident pet black bears that would come to the open dump at the back of the property.  One night, I'm laying in my tent. I don't remember if it was late (2 am) and I woke up, or if it was earlier in the night (say 11 pm) and I was just going to sleep. Through the woods (about fifty yards away is my guess) the stomping and crashing of smaller trees started going on. It was loud. I was surprised at first and a little afraid because I was squatting illegally on state property.  With my familiarity of the noises of the night in the woods, I listened carefully to try to determine or identify what was making the noise. My first assessment was that it was bi-ped ... not a bear or a deer. Realizing this scared me the most.  Understanding the force necessary to cause the destructive sounds I was listening to scared me even further. I don't know if profanity is allowed or acceptable, but i was more effing afraid than I could ever remember, praying that what I was listening to wouldn't start moving towards my tent.  The noise sounded like a two-legged monster crashing through the woods hastily as if trying to make quick time CRASH CRASH CRASH CRASH !!! It was then I realized that I heard a dog (or two, I don't remember) barking in pursuit. Gratefully, the noise was not coming towards me and I suspected that whatever was moving so quickly and violently through the woods was trying to elude the dog(s).   I think this whole event lasted about 30 seconds and then the crashing stopped. Then the next scariest thing happened. The dog barked a few more times and then it made that sound dogs make when they are brutally injured. After that, I did not hear a single damned thing except the fear white-noise inside my head.  You know ...  I worked as a split-maker for a year on LP land in Mendocino County and as a timber operator for about five years east of Fort Bragg and Mendocino. I worked alone very often. I was surprised to read a post on this website wherein the person who wrote it also said they often felt (and somehow knew) they were not alone when in the woods. I would turn off my chainsaw now and then and I could ""feel"" something watching me.  The last strange thing I would share with you about the 22 years of my life 2 - 12 miles east of Fort Bragg in the woods is the frequent discovery of disemboweled animals. Simply that ... disemboweled ... the rest of the animal intact.   What an eclectic mix we are in the wonderful County of Mendocino.

It really stunk!  We looked around to see where the smell was coming from, and there at the edge of the tree line stood a huge ape that we here in Garberville recognized immediately as a sasquatch. He had been standing there watching the children hard at play. He never made any attempt to come into the campground any further, but just stood there watching all the activity on the playground.

My father had completed our driveway and was sitting on the porch in the evening when he heard what he thought was me walking around the corner of the house in the freshly laid gravel. Since I'm relaying this story to you, you've probably figured out it wasn't me but something else he was faced with, which quickly turned and ran away when it saw him, leaving behind a ""wild"", ""musty"", ""skunk-like"" smell. Which hung around about 30 minutes (unlike a skunk [ed: odor], which hangs around for days). Over the next ten to twelve years we had other ""visits"". Sometimes two or three in the same summer, and then we would maybe go two years without one. They ranged from footprints, to ""screams"", to smells.  Needless to say I took up an interest in sasquatch. I was at the same time intrigued and afraid. I had ""avoided"" actually seeing one with my own eyes for about nine years, and with that, I could somehow write it off as actually existing (pretty dumb in retrospect with the physical evidence and the number of witnesses in Pope Valley, who incidentally didn't want to talk about it either).  My meeting came one night when me and a friend of mine were sitting on my parents' porch, ""he"" came walking over the crest in front the house, spotted us and took off running like a middle-linebacker in the NFL. I kept waiting, (and hoping), for it to get down on all fours but it never did. I turned to my friend and he was as shocked and afraid as I was so I knew I had actually seen this thing.

Also noted, the area has many streams and creeks with beautiful clear water. Also noted, this is a very healthy forest with much new growth.  Anyway, we were talking and laughing (my friend Mark is a loud person) and I have said that more than once how far I can hear him. All of the sudden he comes to me and says, ""Andrew, shut up and listen."" Mark seemed a bit riled up so I did what he asked.  What I heard next, I will never EVER forget. It was this horrible screaming sound that I have heard before on my download from the Art Bell radio show. The one where you hear the sound he talks about saying, ""Bigfoot experts have confirmed this sound."" And how ""you would never, ever, want to hear it in the dark of night in the woods."" It was the SAME SOUND!!!  I am sure of it. Would stake my life on it. It was farther away than the screams on the recording and could be missed if you were to talk. But make no mistake, once we all shut up, and we did, we all heard this. It even repeated like the screams in the recording.  Someone suggested perhaps a coyote. No way, Mark and I are experienced woodsmen, and I have been inches away from bears while backpacking in Yosemite and have coyote's where I live!  I know what a wolf sounds like. This was not even close to those sounds. Also noted, as soon as Mark originally told me to shut up and listen, we both verified the sound as being the one in the recording at the same time!!!  It was that unmistakeable. We have listened to numerous recordings and the one stated above is the only one that sounded like the calls, screams we heard that night. Also noted, the noise changed briefly on one call and sounded (don't laugh) like someone strangling a cat.  Also noted, it almost seemed like it heard us because the sound would stop and someone would make a joke and we would laugh and then we would hear it immediately after making noise.  Also noted, could not judge distance but it seemed like it was a couple of miles away (just a guess). Also noted, the sound came from above the basin where we were. We had taken a 12-gauge [shotgun] out, and fired it twice after this went on for a few minutes. Heard no more sounds after this. We do not hunt animals (we do not believe in shooting animals) we target-shoot and go skeet-shooting. We would never ever want to shoot one of these animals, save of course using a camera.  Also noted, the night before, early in the morning, I heard what sounded like someone walking around our camp very softly and carefully. I did not even think about it at the time and it was too damn cold to even want to get out of my tent. No prints, smell, or any sighting was observed. I asked if anyone was out at the time and the answer was no. Also noted, I was pretty shaken after hearing this unnerving sound. I pretty much stayed by the fire the rest of the night. Looked often into the darkeness but saw nothing. No other animal sound was reported the rest of the night.  After I got home I played the sound to the rest of our camp group, they all verified that it ""sure did sound like what we heard."" Although, some of the guys had trouble digesting this. But still verified what I am saying here about the same sound. Also noted, it was opening weekend for hunting season but did not see anyone.","Early in the morning the night before I heard what sounded like someone lightly walking through our camp.

About three years ago I began visiting a woman in Quincy CA, a small northern Sierra community which Tom Morris notes, ""has always been notorious for its Bigfoot sightings."" He sure was right. Over the last three years the local paper, the Feather River Bulletin, has reported seven different sightings in the same general area of the county. Five of those may have been hoaxed, but two deserve further discussion.  The first one occurred at 1:15 a.m. on February 13,1994. Mary and Jerry Cain, Quincy's only bakers, were returning from Reno. Near Lee Summit, ten miles east of town, a large fur covered animal crossed Hwy. 70 in front of their car and strolled up a steep bank and into the forest. It looked exactly like the many drawings they'd seen of Bigfoot. They doubt this was someone dressed in a Gorilla costume. When it was light, Mary and Jerry returned to the scene and found large, deep footprints in the snow. They took pictures of the prints, wrote a narrative of their adventure and posted the information on the wall of their bakery. I've had a chance to study the photos and I'm convinced they aren't contrived; I've also spoken to the Cains and I believe they're telling the truth about their experiences.  The second sighting happened near Cemetery Hill, an area which divides east and west Quincy. It was about 11:30 p.m. on October 16,1995 when Larry Riddle, out for a stroll, smelled what he thought was rotting garbage. As he was looking for the source of the smell, he felt he was being watched. He turned and saw an eight foot, fur covered creature watching him. Riddle lived near Yellowstone most of his life: ""I'm familiar with bears and this was not a bear"". He stated that there was no bearlike snout. He also refuses to believe it was someone trying to fool him. He felt it would be hard to mimic an eight-foot-tall Bigfoot. ""I'm sure I'm going to get laughed at"" Riddle said.

When we arrived at the camp we discovered that the camp staff had all went to Big Bear, CA, to a party so we where the ONLY scouts in the campground.  We went down to our assigned campsite and set up camp. It was approx. 11:00 p.m. when we first heard the screams. We were all gathered around the outdoor stove telling jokes and stories when we heard the first scream. It started out like a wolf howl but ended like a man's scream. It stopped the crickets from chirping! Our scoutmaster came out of his tent to listen as well. Then we heard it again. It sounded like it came from about 1 mile south of our campground. Needless to say we were pretty scared.   We all went to sleep about 12:00 a.m. At about 1:00 a.m. my buddy Kenny woke we up and told me that there was something moving around in the bushes and trees next to our campground. We all woke up and Kenny got up and walked over to where the rustling was coming from. He then shined his flashlight into the area north of our campground. And there it was! A Sasquatch was standing in the tree line looking at us. We all broke out yelling and screaming. It was about 6-7ft. tall and had brown hair all over except the face. It had a very short neck and long arms going down to the knees. It's eyes reflected the flashlight's beam like a rabbit's would; the eyes shone red. It turned and with long steps walked northeast from the area then up a steep wooded hill and out of sight. One of the guys actually pissed his pants from fright!",The two loud screams.,,The camp staff told us that they had heard of sightings around the campground area.,July of 1975. It was hot summer weather. The incident occurred at 1:00 a.m.,The area is a heavily wooded mountain area. There was a trail east of the campground that ran north to south. The Sasquatch crossed this trail then up the hill.,

I could hear snoring coming from the direction of the tent and when I peeked out the window, I couldn't see anything. I started to get up and all of a sudden, the van started rocking violently back and forth and I was thrown from side to side. I yelled real loud and the shaking stopped.  My friends called from the tent and asked what the problem was and at that point I grabbed my flashlight and pulled back the curtains covering the back window and shined the flashlight outside. A figure moved towards the left and I could see it was walking upright like a man but it had hair from head to toe and in a second I saw it walk past the front windshield and head into the forest.  I pulled open the side door and jumped out yelling for my friends to get up. It smelled really bad, like a cesspool, around our campsite and I was badly shaken. We started a fire and talked about what had just happened and I learned that something had been tossing pebbles onto the top of the tent and they thought it was me and then something had brushed up against the back of the tent and they also thought it was me. But after I told them about the van shaking, they swore it wasn't them and we decided to pack up and head home early.  Later, I remembered seeing a pair of glowing yellowish eyes through the trees after we had first arrived but they disappeared almost immediately and I figured it was just a deer or something to that effect.","Only the very bad smell and also, no birds or animals making any sounds.

SHRIEKING MONSTER A horror tale of a 10-foot-tall man led sheriff's deputies last night into a dark brushy area adjoining Peter Pam subdivision, west of Cold Springs.  Officers were unable to spot a monster but returned with an equally horrifying report of unidentified shrieking sounds.  ""There was definitely some creature in the woods,"" Deputy William Huntley confirmed. ""I've never heard anything like it.""  Huntley's partner, Elbert Miller of Cold Springs, a veteran woodsman, agreed: ""I've never heard a sound like that in all my years in the woods.""  The search was touched off by an anonymous telephone call to the sheriff's office about 8:30 p.m.  The caller refused to give his name on grounds, ""You'll think I'm crazy and put me in a strait jacket.""  He reported seeing a man - at least nine or 10 feet tall - in the road by an old gravel pit north of the Peter Pam tract.  Huntley quoted the caller, ""It was moving around.  It appeared to be human but was the most awful thing I have ever seen.""  Huntley said the caller added, ""I'm scared.  I'm an adult and I'm not crazy.  I'm not drunk.  I don't even drink.""  Huntley said a second man then came on the phone to confirm the story.  The second man had not seen the monster, Huntley said, but he reported seeing tracks more than 14 inches long.  Huntley and Miller then drove to the area.  In first radio dispatches to the Sonora sheriff's office, they reported hearing sounds something like ""a human in distress.""  ""It's heading right towards the car.  Here it comes,"" Huntley advised.  After a delay, he reported, ""Now it seems to be circling the car.  It sounds more and more like an animal of some kind.""  But the two officers reported they could see nothing in the heavy brush.  ""Its definitely not a bear,"" Huntley radioed.  ""Elbert thinks it's more possibility a mountain lion, but it's not a mountain lion noise.""  The two officers shouted at the creature and noticed their shouts did not seem to scare it.  As they attempted to move closer, however, the sound seemed to move away.  The officers were forced to head back to Cold Springs when the patrol car's gas supply ran low, but they returned to the spot a short time late and found the unidentified creature still shrieking.  Huntley said they stayed in the area until 1:30 a.m. but were still unable to spot the source of the sounds.  The officers returned to the scene after daylight but found nothing to explain the mystery.  ""There were no tracks, nothing to indicate anything at all,"" Huntley advised.  He noted the area is brushy and rocky and the ground is frozen.  Huntley and Miller report they will return to the area tonight on the chance the creature will pay a second visit. ",,,,,,27

The prints, described as 14 to 15 inches in length, were spotted this morning near the area where Sunday night reports placed a grotesque 10-foot-tall man and repeated shrieking noises.  The tracking party, lead by Sheriff Miller Sardella, reportedly followed prints north of Peter Pam subdivision, through Jenness park and the Sierra Boy Scout camp area below Cold Springs.  Tracks were first spotted yesterday by reserve Deputy Elbert Miller, and original reports from the sheriff's office set the size of the prints at 15 to 17 inches.  Miller lost the trail among cabins in the Jenness park area.  Sardella, with Deputies William Huntley and Pete DeMott, returned to the area this morning and spotted additional footprints.  Sardella described the tracks as shoe prints, apparently made before last night's light snowfall.  He said cabins in the area were checked but officers found no evidence of break-ins.  The sheriff said they saw fresh mountain lion tracks in the area.  Noting mountain lions will stalk and screech at a human, Sardella suggested a lion as the possible source of noises heard Sunday night by Miller and Huntley.  At the time, Miller had described the shrieks as somewhat like a mountain lion but assured, ""It's not a mountain lion noise."" ",,,,,,28

We were unable to see what had made the sound.  We felt like something was watching us, and we both had a terrible fear (but we had both come across bears and other animals in the forest, and never felt this type of fear before).  The fear made us unable to move or speak. After several minutes, the regular forest noises started again, and since we felt better (like we weren't going to die), we were able to move away from the location.

I belong to a world war two battle reenacting club for seven years now.  The place where this happened we have been going to before I joined the club.  The people in the nearest town of Foresthill know this club well.  The story I'm about to tell you is true and the people involved are veterans of the hills of California. It was back in 1998, the second weekend of September (I know this because we always meet on the second weekend of the month).  Anyway, on Friday night, I was on my way up to the site to set up camp for next day. When I got up there, my unit commander was already there, so after we got done, we bedded down for the night.  Before you knew it, it was morning and all through the night we kept hearing cars and trucks pulling up. The next morning we woke up to everyone there (all four units worth).  All that day, we battled from dawn until dusk.  When we were done, all tired and bruised, we managed to drag ourselves back to camp for dinner.  Some went into town, the rest of us stayed and had it there. Later, we were all back and sitting around four different fires and talking about the day.  One by one we went back to our tents or cots and sleeping bags.  The last thing I remember before I went to sleep was both of the commanders talking about tomorrow's set up and that was it, or so I thought.  Well, I was rolling over in my cot and slightly awake when, well for the lack of a better word, heard a ""howling sound"".  I, in all my life, have never heared anything like it before. It cried out eight or nine times . After a few moments there was nothing, so I got tired and went back to sleep, but only because the sound wasn't too close to the camp.  It sounded like it came from where we where battling that day up on the ridge, about half a mile from us.  I woke up again about one hour later. I had to use the bathroom, I put on my boots and walked over to a bush to relieve myself, and on the way back I heard it again, but this time it was much closer.  It was right down the road from us and it was loud, very loud, and I know that this time I wasn't the only one to hear it.   Several times it let out . one after another.  This time it was much more deep and clear to the ear. My unit commander and several of the other unit people woke up. To my and their knowledge, we didn't know what to do . No matter what I did, I could not stay awake but before I went back to sleep, I loaded my gun with real bullets and put my bayonet under my blanket near my pillow. What ever it was, if it came into camp and hurt me or anyone, I was going to kill it.  We heard it two more times that night, each time it was further away.   When we woke up that next morning, many people were confused and in denial about what happened.  We all were trying to think of what it could have been, but no one said what was on everyone's mind.  To this day it gives me chills up and down my spine at the thought of what we all knew it was.","Well, when we battle, we use alot of blank ammo.  We have full and semi-automatic weapons.

The Pacific Crest Trail is on the far side of the campground.,"Kennedy Meadows, CA",,"My incident was not a sighting of an actual Big Foot creature, but of footprints.  My father and I were camping at Kennedy Meadows Campground on the South Fork of the Kern River in California.  On April 24, 2001 - we had cross the stream to do some hiking, but could not cross back the same we had came. We decided to go upstream to see if there were any better crossing points, or cross the bridge which was much further upstream.  About 2 miles upstream from the campgrounds we found a suitable place to swim across, then we proceeded uphill to look for the Pacific Crest Trail which leads back to the campground. We figured we were probably within a quarter of a mile from the trail which runs parallel to the river.  While walking through the forest looking for the trail, I happened to look down and noticed some unusual tracks. I called my father over to look at them as well, and to provide confirmation that I was not just ""seeing things"".  What we saw were footprints which looked approximately 12 inches long and probably 5 or 6 inches wide in the shape of a human foot. The print had 5 toes - with the big toe having the most prominent print. The foot did not seem to have the concave pattern on the inside which would indicate an arch - it seemed almost square in shape.  I considered the possibility that these prints could be a hoax, however, at that point, we had not yet found the trail and it turned out that we were still about 100 feet from it. The prints we saw were in the forest between the river and the PC trail and actually looked as though they could have been travelling parallel to the trail.  We could not determine the age of the print. It had rained probably 5 days earlier and the print had been made after the rain, but did not look much older than a day or two.

The decided to walk back to the campground by following the river instead of the trail.  Also, prior to that experience, my father said that some Rangers were doing maintenance on the PC trail and one of them had stood up to straighten his back and looked down the trail.

From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town.     Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base.  Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall.   Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense “Sightings” program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line.  At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started.  It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection.     I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone’s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn’t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team).  I asked the upper team “do you see anything” and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny).  The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn’t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was.   Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  “John it’s looking right at you, can’t you see it, it’s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge”.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder.     The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that’s when they would say, “it went back into the trees”, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others.  This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life.  That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.   You can listen to this event by going to sightings.com and clicking on archived shows.   Look for May 27th 2001.     The Bigfoot portion is the last hour of the show.

One was at base blasting sounds (he didnt see it) and the other two was located up above the base with night vision,,"dusk to dark, moon was out for a short time only",Clearcut area with fir and oak around it.   treeline was thick with small trees and underbrush.

06089,978,2770,1979,Summer,July,CA,Shasta County,Road by Squaw Creek about 2 to 4 miles past the last camp ground. Isolated enough that we only saw two guys on dirt bikes and two forest rangers in the area long before the incident happened. The rangers checked our campfire permit and briefed us on their interpretation of a safe fire. They commented that they had never seen anyone camped this far out. It did take a 2 to 3 hours to get to the spot where we eventually camped.,Lake Shasta,Road by Squaw Creek,"This is an old report so I don't know if it will be of any use but my wife and I remember it as if it were yesterday.  We had just moved to California from Colorado and didn't know anywhere to hike so we drove to a Ranger Station in Shasta Lake. We bought a map and although it was the 4th of July weekend we asked the rangers if there was anyplace we could go that would be isolated or not too crowded. We got a fire permit because we were planning to 4 wheel somewhere remote and then hike to a camp area. We were told to drive on a logging road next to squaw creek and were shown some turns to take to end up past the last campground on Squaw creek. We drove until we spotted a stream leading up to a meadow about 200 yards from the road. We crossed a deep creek with our camping gear and helped our dog cross because the water was swift enough to make swimming across difficult. We set up our tent and decided to follow the creek to see if fishing might be good. We were surprised by an abandoned beaver dam and the pond was full of fish. I wanted to hike a bit further and my wife wanted to finish some reading so she went back to camp with the dog. I continued hiking until I heard something following me. When I stopped it stopped. I suspected I was being followed by a couger so I made lots of noise by stepping on branches and acting like I wasn't afraid of anything. I still stopped from time to time to look toward the area of the noise and had my knife ready along with a big stick that I purposely hit against rocks and trees to make myself appear aggressive. Finally I got back to camp and my wife asked me what was going on. I didn't want to scare her so I said it was getting dark and had to get some firewood. She said the dog had been growling and looking in the direction from which I had come. I still didn't say anything mainly because I wasn't afraid because I had packed a gun with plenty of ammo. I had been hunting and in the woods all my life. I figured a fire would keep the lion away along with our talking and laughing, plus we had a big husky dog that was a good protector. When I got back to camp with some wood my wife informed me that the dog must have taked a poop around the camp site because it stunk. It did smell but I was unable to find anything to get rid of. We lit a fire and cooked then settled back to let the fire burn out. When the fire got low we were terrified by the sound of breaking branches and a sound unlike anything I have ever heard in my life. I screamed to my wife to throw more wood on the fire and rushed to the tent to get my gun. I was bowled over first by my wife then the dog. I got the gun and yelled to my wife to get the flashlights. We threw more wood on the fire and heard something retreat. At this point I got my composure back and we shined our very bright lights into the woods hoping to pick out a pair of eyes. When I didn't see any I was alamed because I thought all animals eyes glowed in the dark as they reflected light. I was thinking that there must be a man out there trying to scare us. So I yelled for whoever was out there to identify himself because I has a gun and was prepared to shoot if I heard another noise. Now I had to tell my wife what had happened on my hike and what I still assume is correct about animals eyes. We talked about going back to the bronco and leaving but decided it was too risky to walk 200 yards through the woods and then have to cross the steam in the dark where we could easily step in a hole and lose the gun or be at a big disadvantage. We decided to burn a big fire all night and stay awake. As frightened as we were I talked my wife into getting some sleep on my lap and I would stay awake. She fell asleep and then so did I. We were startled awake by the dog growling and something rushing toward us through the trees. We threw more wood on the fire and screamed into the woods that we were ready to shoot. Again a retreat as the fire got bigger. Now we were definitly awake for the rest of the night. The next morning we packed up and left. When we got down to the stream I remembered my axe shovel and saw were still at the camp so I went back for them. I was greeted by a horrible smell, but that was it so I grabbed my things and ran down the hill. When I got close to the stream I slowed down and started walking. My wife informed me that right after I left the dog was growling and looking in the direction that I had taken. Since this incident we now camp in designated campsites that have other campers. We always used to 4 wheel or hike to places to camp that were completly isolated. We never considered bigfoot until I told my story to a new friend and he mentioned that the situation was similar to bigfoot related incidents. ",We smelled a smell similar to dog poop.,"Two witnesses, my wife and I. We were sitting by a dying campfire.",The only thing I have heard about the area is that some people say there are hermits living in the Shasta Lake area.,About 10:00 pm cloudy skies with occasional light drizzle.

06073,980,2779,1981,Winter,February,CA,San Diego County,,Julian,,"My book, ""Night-Side of Gold,"" was written from hindsight remembrance of encounters with Bigfoot during an 8-year mining venture in the Santa Lucias along the coast of Southern California. Now, in the Lagunas around Julian, in San Diego County, I have been actively pursuing reports of Bigfoot in these mountains and the Anza-Borrego Desert below, and most particularly within a certain Indian Reservation. In February, 1981, I happened to be at the right place at the right time to meet a young Indian who talked openly of his interest in Bigfoot and said he had seen him on his reservation and knew the location of caves where Bigfoot hid, and he would take me there - now!  He guided me up a fearfully storm-wrecked road. My ancient van was not designed for such, nor my senior years to cope, but once started there was no turning back. Disaster seemed certain but I would die TRYING! We reached a small flat. ""Park here,"" my escort said. ""Now we hike down a canyon.""  He hiked ahead rapidly and I eventually caught up with him - napping under a bush. Below him, a small stream followed a darkened canyon around a bend. I had parked in bright sunshine and in less than a mile we had descended into sunless gloom. ""The caves are over there, but I am NOT about to go there.""   Until my guide refused to enter a taboo area, I had not really believed his story. I knew that no money or incentive on earth will induce an Indian to enter taboo ground. ""Okay, now we wait. Have a seat."" I said to him, ""What are we waiting for?"" He said, ""To watch. He comes out this time of the day and walks around. He drinks from those old rock-troughs I showed you by the road. Sometimes he hangs out by that wrecked house where the road loop starts. You in a hurry?""   I told him no, but that I was not about to drive back down the road in the dark. We hiked back to my van which was completely concealed in the brush until you reached the road. It was dusk when I drove out of the Reservation.   After a week of heavy storms had eased up, I sought out my Indian escort. Unlike before, he was neither friendly nor talkative. Briefly I was then told, ""My people are complaining. Our tribal spokesman is very displeased. You will not be welcome to return, with or without your friends - and  trespassers risk being shot."" So, I backed down for awhile - but I was not ""out.""  For three months I planned for a return trip. A friend obtained permission from a well-known Indian to drive up the mountain just to take pictures, to stay on the road and not to wander around the reservation. I had studied the map well but a certain hunch compelled me to request we reverse our direction. After a steep turn, we were blocked - but good - by a heavy pick-up in the road next to a parked bulldozer. In front stood five Indians - shoulder to shoulder, spanning the road, with their backs to us.  ""Looks like we've got trouble,"" my escort said, very quietly. He stepped out with a cheery greeting and, as a Forest Service firefighter, was recognized. Two men approached me. ""You see Bigfoot this morning?"" They knew who I was. ""No, and I came up here just to shake hands with him."" That brought welcomed laughter, then a statement, ""I have seen him. He comes up from the canyon below the flat you just passed. He doesn't come out very often.""   This confirmed what my first Indian guide had told me. The ""sticky"" situation was smoothed out but not to the extent that we could continue to explore. I am presently biding my time for the right moment to return.",,,,,,
06073,981,2782,1970,Summer,September,CA,San Diego County,,Alpine,Interstate 8,"""The Zoobies"" -- 1992 interview with Sgt. Doug Huse, San Diego County Sheriffs Department  MONEYMAKER: Okay, just go ahead and tell me about yourself, when you started working there and so on.   HUSE: I started working the Alpine area (east of San Diego, California) in March of 1970. I came to the department the previous year. I was working out there in a patrol capacity for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department I was a deputy at the time and actually worked Alpine for about 2 years, from March of 1970 to April of 1972. As far as trying to recall exactly when this went down, the best I can come up with is that it was after the Laguna fire of 1970 ... September of 1970.   MONEYMAKER: The Laguna fire affected which areas?  HUSE: Well, it was the largest brush fire at the time in California history, and burned specifically in the Sweetwater River area from east of Alpine all the way south and west, probably another 15 miles. It was quite an extensive burn and through the area in question, Alpine, on the south side of Interstate 8. To recall the chain of events, it was extremely cold which means the time of year would've been sometime after September of 1970, probably December or January, maybe February...let's see, that would be 1971 ... well, it was definitely winter.   MONEYMAKER: Was that about the time of your first contact with the key witness, Dr. Baddour (prominent San Diego psychiatrist)?   HUSE: Yes, and I don't recall the reason, but Dr. Baddour was stopped by a two-man patrol unit. Baddour was traveling eastbound, which would've been from the San Diego area to what we learned later was his home in Alpine. On the front seat of his car, I don't remember what kind of car it was, he had a loaded .44 magnum revolver with a 6-inch barrel. That's the same type of gun that Dirty Harry made famous. It's the largest caliber hand gun you can buy. Of course this piqued our interest a little bit. I wasn't the contact, I was what we call the cover during this particular stop. My partner's the one who made first contact and found the gun. He secured the revolver and was asking the doctor, who'd identified himself as Dr. Baddour, why he was carrying the weapon. Baddour said it was because of a ... and I don't know what he actually said at the time, but my partner heard him say, ""Zoobie,"" ... and so from there on all our conversations throughout the department referred to whatever Dr. Baddour had seen as a Zoobie. That wasn't what the doctor actually called it, I don't believe, but that's what my partner heard and that's how the name got coined.  MONEYMAKER: At the time did Dr. Baddour describe this Zoobie to the officer?   HUSE: Yes, he did, to both of us as a matter of fact. He described the Zoobie as a large, upright, walking hairy creature. Dr. Baddour convinced us and later other members of my department, including one of my patrol sergeants, that in truth he'd had three separate encounters with the Zoobies.   MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour say how many of these Zoobies there were and where the sightings happened?   HUSE: Yeah, one sighting was made by his entire family within the confines of his yard and immediate area, and at one time they saw three Zoobies. What Dr. Baddour described to us was what he assumed was a father, mother and child with the largest of the Zoobies being over 6 feet tall, maybe 7 feet tall. The tallest was very hairy and much larger-framed than an ordinary man. What he described as the mother was about 5 feet tall, and the smaller one was about 3 or 4 feet tall. Like I said, the doctor convinced a number of us that he'd in fact seen something unusual. What happened then was that we did get involved in an investigation of the sightings. I did because of the shift I worked which was either 10 p.m. at night to 6 a.m., or what we called the evening or overlap shift which was from 6 p.m. to 2:30 in the morning. Neither of those shifts was conducive to interviewing citizens in the area, so I wasn't able to locate other witnesses, and I can't recall if I ever talked, to a deputy who canvassed the area looking for witnesses.   MONEYMAKER: How many people lived in the area at the time?   HUSE: There were very few homes, probably 5 or no more than 6 residences, and Baddour's was the last home on the narrow road. Going back in my memory 20 years now, I'd say his house was a quarter to a third of a mile off the main road used to get to his place, almost in a straight line due south of Alpine Blvd. That area hasn't grown much since then, no planned residential development in there. At that time the Baddour family themselves consisted of the doctor, his wife, a daughter and a son. The daughter was 17 and the son was younger, maybe 13 or 14.   MONEYMAKER: Can you describe what the terrain looks like, is it actually alpine forest, etc.?  HUSE: It's not a forest by any means, the elevation's no more than 2300 feet. The road goes east and up, and in about another 20 miles it eventually climbs to about 5000 feet.   MONEYMAKER: Does it continue up into forested areas?   HUSE: Yes it does and it follows the Sweetwater River it's about 10 miles. The Sweetwater River isn't much of a flowing river. It runs about three-quarters of a mile south of Dr. Baddour's place. Of course it always depended on rainfall, but the river hasn't run continuously anytime in the 20 years I've been familiar with the area. There's no snowfall at all. The terrain itself is quite steep behind Dr. Baddour's property, going down into the (Sweetwater) river bottom itself. It's all primarily brush and chaparral.  MONEYMAKER: Any bears in the area?   HUSE: I don't think I've ever heard of a bear sighting in San Diego county, and again I've been in the area almost 23 years. We have deer everywhere here along with coyotes and fox and other types of wildlife, but no bears.   MONEYMAKER: What else do you remember about Dr. Baddour's sightings?   HUSE: Let's see, the first set of circumstances I remember was Dr. Baddour finding damage to the house when he'd just moved in. He said he bought the house from an older German couple and all of the light bulbs, inside and out, were the yellow bug repellent type. Baddour said the German man told me that he shouldn't change them to white, that he should get used to the yellow light.  MONEYMAKER: Because of an insect problem?   HUSE: Baddour said the German was very evasive about that, evasive also about a lot of details regarding the house and property. The property did have some acreage, I don't recall the size but it was larger than a city lot anyway. The property had some fruit trees in the front and back yards. I don't remember what kind of fruit trees they were, but the house and trees were surrounded by a fence. One of Baddour's complaints was that fruit was being picked off the trees at the tops, but not from the bottoms. The trees were upward of 7 or 8 feet high, or maybe 10 feet high. Anyway, the fruit was disappearing from the tops of his trees and his fence was getting knocked down. He had a wind chime at one of the doors made of brass or some kind of strong metal which frequently rang in the blowing wind, and at one point the wind chime suddenly turned up flattened. Baddour couldn't explain it and we couldn't duplicate it. It was smashed. Baddour did make a plaster cast of a footprint and I know we had photographs of it, if we didn't in fact have a plaster cast of the print ourselves. But I do recall there was a plaster cast.   MONEYMAKER: Do you remember the approximate size of the footprint?   HUSE: I'm 6-foot-3 and I wear a size 12 shoe, and I'd have to say this one was larger than my shoe and much wider than my foot. I'd say it was about 13 or 14 inches in length, and I've been wracking my brain trying to remember if it had 4 toes or 5 toes, but I just can't recall.**   [**According to researcher, Ken Coon, who visited the Alpine area in 1971, Dr. Baddour's ""Zoobies"" left V -shaped, 4-toed footprints, 16 inches long and 8 inches wide with the widest measurement across the toes. The foot narrowed down to 5 inches at the heel.]  MONEYMAKER: But there's some recollection that it might have had an usual number of toes?   HUSE: Yes, I do seem to remember that, but I can't bring it to mind. I know the footprint was wide overall, and less wide at the heel, but the heel was still wider than a human foot would be.   MONEYMAKER: Did you or any of the officers talk to the doctor's wife or kids?  HUSE: Specifically the word came back to me, and I'm not sure which deputy found out, but the daughter said she had a sighting in the early morning hours as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Blvd. That would have been adjacent to the access road leading to the Baddour house. She was getting on the bus and spotted the creature off in the brush. There's some very thick, very tall brush along the road there.   MONEYMAKER: Do you remember any details of what she saw?   HUSE: No, not really, the man who was deeply involved in this was my patrol sergeant and he's now deceased. He was so involved with it that on his days off he'd go up there and camp to the rear of Baddour's house. He'd take his older son along and the two of them would camp out in hope of getting a glimpse of one of the Zoobies. They never did. But he was the man who probably had more conversations with the doctor than any-body else. Another sighting involved three Zoobies sighted by a whole family. The Baddours had made it a habit to never go out after dark, but one night they were out with the son to call in their pet dog. In the dark the boy thought he saw the dog near a comer of the house and called out to It. Well, the dog came running back, but from a different corner, and what at first they thought was the dog turned out to be the smaller Zoobie. Apparently it had been laying down and it got up and stood and walked the opposite way, joining the other two, the larger male and female, and they all walked off into the brush.  MONEYMAKER: Did they ever use words like ""ape"" or ""gorilla"" to describe the creatures?   HUSE: No, they never did. Baddour was firm in his own mind that it wasn't an ape or gorilla. It was something totally different than one of those. Well, for lack of anything better we thought it to be more like the California Bigfoot, based on how it was described. Whether it was black or brown I really can't remember.  MONEYMAKER: Did Dr. Baddour ever use the word Bigfoot or Sasquatch to describe the Zoobie?   HUSE: Not to me, no. As a matter of fact we were assigned to make periodic checks of his residence throughout the night because most of the damage to his property was done during the night time, so my partner and I in a two-man car would drive up there and shine the spotlight around his house. Dr. Baddour was very convincing. I can still picture him coming outdoors one night dressed in his skivvies and wearing black high top military boots. That was it, a tee-shirt and shorts with those black boots and carrying that big .44 magnum.   MONEYMAKER: How would you characterize the family, it sounds as though they were all educated, credible people?   HUSE: Yes, I'd characterize them as exactly that. I got the impression the daughter was very intelligent, and of course Baddour himself was a medical doctor, a psychiatrist.   MONEYMAKER: In our earlier phone call to arrange this interview you mentioned something about the creatures, the Zoobies, mimicking human speech ... ?  HUSE: Yes, one of the lighter stories I recall happened when the doctor got home after dark one night. They had chickens there, and earlier he'd called his wife to say he was going to be late and to remind her to feed the chickens before night fall, which she did. When the doctor got home he had to exit his car, open the gate, drove through and stopped, then got out of the car again to close the gate behind him. He said that when he went to close the gate that night he heard a very low, very guttural voice say, 'Here chicky, chicky, chicky...'   MONEYMAKER: That's funny and not unprecedented in the research. Are you saying the impression was that one of the creature's was imitating the doctors wife who'd called in the chickens earlier?  HUSE: Exactly. It was the doctor's opinion, and we had no reason to doubt him, that the Zoobie had some type of intelligence and the capability of producing sounds like that.   MONEYMAKER: Did they ever describe any other sounds or smells, anything like that?   HUSE: Smells, yes. A very pungent odor, maybe like rotting garbage. You know, he did tell us he'd set up cameras around the house with trip-wires, but he wasn't able to get any photographs, at least not while I was working the area. I really can't recall but I know the doctor himself had a close sighting of one of the Zoobies, and there were probably other sightings, but I can't remember now. Of course I worked up there for just those two years, until April of 1972. After that I went to fly helicopters. So I was completely out of touch with what was happening in Alpine, and I didn't get back there until 1981. At that time I was stationed east of the Baddour home, and I didn't hear anything more. I did hear something about the Proctor Valley Monster when I started patrol in 1970, which if true I'd have to assume was on the order of what Dr. Baddour was describing. Now, a few years ago a deputy told me he saw a dark-colored, large, upright furry creature, not a bear and not human, up in some rocks north of Interstate 8, and possibly northwest of El Capitan (reservoir). The deputy told me it was a good distance away. Also, I was involved in a juvenile diversion camp (near Julian, northeast of Alpine), and a couple of counselors from another camp came down and told us they'd see something they couldn't identify in the mountains. After talking with them it was concluded that what they'd seen was probably a Zoobie. Another thing we found out, during our investigation of Dr. Baddour's sightings, was that the Viejas Indians (reservation) just north of Interstate 8 had a legend about a giant hairy man that was the protector of their burial grounds, and those burial grounds were located just about 2 miles north of where Dr. Baddour lived.",,,,,,
06107,988,2794,1987-88,Spring,May,CA,Tulare County,,,Off 395,"I saw what could only be described as a bigfoot several years ago on route to Kennedy Meadows.  I was driving up the dirt road past Grumpy Bear's place and not too far from Kennedy Meadows--maybe a few miles--where we were later camped.  I believe it was around Memorial Day, 1986-88.  The sun was setting, and as I looked to the west to glance at it as it began to dip below the mountains, I something caught my eye out in the desert, among the Joshua trees.  At first I thought it was just a Joshua tree; but it was moving the same direction as I was driving--north.  I slowed, and watched it as it ran.  It was probably 100 yards? or so from me. I could tell it was big and tall, had long, dark brown hair.  Its arms were longer than a man's and I could see the hair flop up and down as it ran.  Its legs appeared to be very muscular and I was impressed by the ease in which it ran--its movement reminded me of a tiger, strong and graceful, although he ran on two legs like a human.  I saw it's head turn towards me, and I got a chill as I thought this thing is making eye contact with me!  Although I felt fear, I also felt it felt fear towards me.  (Don't ask me to explain this, but that's how I felt and I am an intuitive person!)  This was all in a matter of seconds--maybe five.  I turned to my passenger to relate to her what I saw, slowed down some more, but when I looked again to point out the bigfoot, all I saw was Joshua trees and desert.  I felt he was hiding from me. It was really an incredible experience, one that I will always remember.  I didn't stop the car, climb the fence or go after him.  I continued to drive on to the campsite where I told my experience to the rest of the group.  A few weeks to a month later, I remember seeing in the Bakersfield Californian an article that a bigfoot was spotted in the Shirley Meadows Campground.  As I understand it, that's not too far from Kennedy Meadows. ",,I was the only one who spotted him.

06073,995,2816,1982,Spring,May,CA,San Diego County,"Marine Corps Base,Camp Pendleton, California, south of the Cleveland National Forest. Closest town is San Clemente. If you're familiar with the terrain there you'll understand my story better.",,,"I've related this story only to very few people over the years for fear of ridicule by my peers and doubt that anyone would ever really believe me. Anyway in May 1982, while serving on active duty at Camp Pendleton, CA, I was temporarily assigned to a staff of Marines supervising a youth program consisting of a rigorous series of two week long mini-boot camps for teen-aged boys.  Camp Pendleton is flanked by the Pacific on its western flank and by the Cleveland National Forest [on its] northeastern flank. Three different Mt. ranges intersect the base itself and I am very familiar with every nook and cranny on its over 200,000 acres of mountains, ridges, ravines, canyons, trails, back roads and the like.  Anyway on one particular calm night after a long grueling day of forced marches, displays and demonstrations we took all 300 boys up to a bivouac site for the night. The site is situated on large, open meadow shelf above the Infantry Training School at San Onofre/52 area. The boys were exhausted yet eagerly setting up their shelter-halves. They began to get a little too loud, so I began to quiet them and bed them down for the night. The rest of the staff was situated about 35 meters away, up on a little knoll that overlooked the boys. However, I wasn't aware that the staff had already bedded down and that I was the last one still up except for the radio watch, which was half asleep too.  It had become dark with exception of a bit of starlight, which gave me a very good range of vision. Finally I succeeded in getting the kids in the sack and quiet. I then stood for a few moments to ensure all was secure and that not one peep could be heard and none could be.  As I turned facing west and looked towards the closest edge of the perimeter I noticed a tall, dark, bulky figure standing about 15 meters beyond the last tent or 20 meters from where I stood. We seemed to be staring at each other, but it’s hard to say because I could not make out any of its facial definition, but I had a strong gut feeling that it was checking me out real good since I was the only thing moving around. I could feel my heart begin to pound and my entire body felt like it wanted to anchor to the ground. There was no doubt someone or something very odd and dangerous was standing there looking at me. I mean this thing was TALL and wide at the shoulders.  I used my peripheral vision to make sure I wasn't seeing things, but it only confirmed what I already knew. It gently and slightly moved its upper body left and right ever so slowly as though looking around to its front, surveying the area. It was an easy 8 feet tall. Like I mentioned previously, all I could make out was its massive silhouette and no real detail features. It had very broad shoulders, little or no neck, dark, and looked very powerful.  I decided to go get a flashlight out of our vehicle at the top of the knoll and let staff know what was going on. So I began to cautiously and quietly step backwards to prevent whatever it was from charging or coming into bivouac. I continued to keep an eye on the dang thing, which just remained in the same spot. Almost halfway up the knoll I lost sight of it, but I continued to move slowly still trying to locate it. From atop of the knoll it was very difficult to see anything clearly outside the fringe of perimeter because of the dark.  I walked back down to the tents, scanned the area with the flashlight, but didn’t see anything like I had before. The figure had obviously moved. So instead of waking anybody up I sat up for a while and waited to see what and if anything would happen. I also hoped the darn thing wouldn't pop up behind me (we were all unarmed). It would have been worse and maybe a calamity if I had  pushed the panic button and had waken everybody up. After all, we were in charge of nearly 300 young street kids without any formal training, out in the open and I didn’t need the grief if nothing I said or described could have been verified. Thankfully nothing else occurred that night.  In the morning just before daybreak I bee-lined for the spot where I saw the thing standing. There wasn't anything there ... nothing. Not a pole, a bush, a tree, a reed.  I mean nothing that could have simulated what I had seen. We were situated on flat, clear open ground with exception of the knoll and a tree line about 50 to 60 meters away and a mountain behind that which I knew all existed and had seen back-dropped way beyond the figure the previous evening.  The ground was grassy, but was already pretty well matted down and rutted by the constant foot and vehicle movement in that particular training area. I know I saw something that wasn't normal. I know  it wasn't hoax, I know it wasn’t the kids (they were all accounted for). I trust my judgment and I’m now 46 years old and still have perfect vision. I know it wasn't any of the staff because I had seen all of them sleeping when I got up the hill. At that time I had nearly 11 years of active military service in the infantry and had done plenty of night OP's [ed: Observation Posts] to know how to use my eyes in the dark and to know the difference between a bush and a moving object. This was BIG, and real! Oh, and the thing was very quiet, I didn’t hear it make a sound.

06073,996,2817,1998,Summer,,CA,San Diego County,,Boulevard,Jewell Valley Road,"Two years ago while camping at the lake (without permission) we were walking at the south-western inflow to the lake (a seasonal creek.) The water level of the lake was high due to the El Nino rains and the ""creek"" extended out from the lake covering the dirt road with about two feet of water.  Three of us were returning from climbing Boundary Peak when we had to take our shoes off to wade across the creek. Our footprints were clear and distinct in the silty/sandy bottom -- however, near the other side we saw a set of footprints that looked like someone had walked into the water and then back out. These footprints were about the same size as ours, however, they were blurred and had kind of fuzzy marks all around. They had not been there when we had crossed the same spot an hour before.  We all commented about how weird they looked. Later that evening when we sat around our campfire a U.S. Border Patrol Agent stopped by to chat. He had been dragging some old tires along the dirt roads near the border so that he could return later to see if any illegal aliens had crossed the border at that point. We told him about the weird tracks we had seen and he said: ""Oh, yeah, we call him Little Foot -- 'cause the prints aren't big enough to be a Big Foot. Nobody's seen him, though."" The Agent went on to say that everybody in his office just thought it was a Mexican with hairy feet.",,"There were three people in our group.

06105,997,2819,1995,Spring,June,CA,Trinity County,Bridge Camp or Stewart's Fork,Weaverville,,"As my friends and I sat around our campfire, about 3 miles from the trail head at a flat, well trampled site, we heard a group of low based voices ""mummbling"" down the hill and braking large sticks. When the voices drew closer to our camp we heard them change to a more high pitched tone, possibly suprise and uncertainty. Since it was spring the river was swollen and my companions dismissed the noise as something like ""stream garggle echo."" But when it suddenly stopped there was a great abscence of sound and the river couldn't reproduce the noise. I then witnessed large tall shadows move through the trees and down the bank to a flat granite river bank. It was then that what I can only describe as a ""protest dance"" began. The sasquatch began stomping with enough force to almost bounce me up and down on a log seat and the chants grew loud, spirited and quite hysterical. The seat I was on was a thick log supported on either side, about seven feet apart by other logs, that literally bounced when the""protest dance"" began. The message of their chant was unmistakable in any language : ""GET THE --== OUT!"" So much that I declared, ""whatever that is doesn't want us here, let's just pack up and go!!!""  My friends, although visibly quite shaken, were still reluctant to concede our site. Then, abruptly the chants, actually shouts and screams stopped. With a few deep hooted orders from what I believed to be the male, the pack of voices trailed off. I didn't relax again until I heard screams much later, far up the valley and then from the mountaintop on the other side. Just passing through, I thought.   Later, just after I had settled into my tent, my tentmate asked, ""Did you hear that""? Even though I had my sleeping bag pulled back from my ears because I had heard a shuffling in exactly the place he described I replied, ""No"", hoping it would go away. I lay there on my back watching the fires orange glow and then, BLACK! A silhouette had eclipsed our fire and was squatted in front of the tent! I caught a scream in my Adam's apple for fear I might frighten the creature into... who knows what. It was so close! I could feel it's breath pushing against the nylon and a warm stentch filling the air. Five clear digits groped at the zipper in curiosity. I could sense the way a German Shepard senses the fear of an adolescent, that the sasquatch knew that I knew he was there, and that I was literally scared pissless! I had to go before he arrived but held it all night! The shadow gave way to the familiar warm glow of the fire just as it had arrived.   In the morning I actually found some hairs (thin black hairs with silver tips) and a few deep pot holes on the trail that were pushed in by something heavy.   Before the encounter I was a skeptic. Now I feel Dr. Krantz's idea of families is exactly what we encountered. (I saw a documentary after the incident) I also feel I ""sensed"" the intelligence, compassion and even mischevious sense of humour that these animals possess.   Please don't take this as a joke, at least I believe every word of what I said. Yes I do kick myself for not collecting the hair/photographing the indentations or even swallowing my fear and moving an inch to peak outside!!!!!  I would like to say that I think it was a family of bigfoot, possibly migrating. They were definitely communicating with one another, even if it was only grunts, they got the point across.",,"Sitting around the fire, roasting mallows, getting ready for bed.

06105,998,2820,1996,Spring,March,CA,Trinity County,"This incident occurred about 1 mile below the Lewiston river damn in a park service campground that was still closed for the season at the time. This gis about 5 miles up the road from the town of Lewiston, California I remember specifically that there is a fire base camp on the hill above the campsite. I do not remeber the county name, but I can get it for you if you cannot locate it yourself. ",Lewiston,,"A creature was observed in dim light at a range of approximately 15 feet. The creature had an observable stature of at least 8 feet, but the head itself was never seen. The creature was illuminated by the peripheral glare of our Mazda Navajo's low beams as my wife was loading the car from the passenger side door. We have photographic evidence of the creature in the form of footprints found along the road side above the campsite which clearly show a difference between an uphill gate and a downhill gate. The creature seemed to walk down, then up a small distance, and then down to cross the road. It left a great variety (about 20 or so) of prints in different positions of locomotion over the terrain. We have photos of this trail as well as closeups of the clearer prints with a measurement reference next to them.   The events where as follows:   My wife and I were returning to our campsite from dinner at a restaurant in Lewiston at about 10:00 p.m.. As we entered the campground we noticed that our campsite was disturbed. For being a windless night, there was no reason our 8 man dome tent should have been on its side with the contents spilled out on the ground and under the tent itself. We are in the habit of keeping everything in either the car or tent when we leave so there was nothing else to mess up there. Another thing is that the tent was zipped up when we left and now was open.   We parked and inspected the area around the sit to see if anything was missing. After everything was accounted for, we decied that it must have been restless teens from the area just having ""fun."" At this point we decided to pack up and get a hotel room in town.   Now this is important; my wife and I had been camping already for about three weeks as we were on a vacation. We had decided early on that if we saw or heard anything (like a bear, etc...) we would just say to the other calmly, ""as fast as you can, please go to the car.""   My wife and I uprighted the tent and she grabbed the pillows and took them to the car as i started to roll up our sleeping bags. After being gone for about a two minutes i heard her say ""Steven, as fast as you can, please just get to the car with the keys!"" She said it calmly but I instantly could tell there was something really wrong with her. I dropped everything and just went to the car, started it and we backed up and drove to the entrance of the campground..   Now this is what she saw. As she was putting the pillows in the backseat of our truck on the passenger side door (the camp was on the drivers side) she saw some movement off in her peripheral vision in the glow of the headlights about 15 feet from her. At first she thought it may have been a deer as we had seen several earlier that day in the area and so she calmly closed the door enough to shut of the interior light and looked at the area of the movement. The creature then appeared to stand up and started to walk away from her direction toward the rivers edge. She only saw it for about 2 secondes but saw a definate human like shape and (mostly its back and left shoulder) and the impression of brown coloring. We also both recall a strong odor in the area that we could smell at times but never paid any attention too.   We discussed what happened (she was almost hysterical with fear) and I turned the car around and drove back and around the site with my highbeams on. One feels a slight bit invincible in a big vehicle, even from big animals. We saw nothing, but nevertheless we put everything in the car without even packing it and left. That night we ended up driving to, I believe, Redding which is 30 miles or so away and staying there in a hotel.   The next day, we returned with a camera (a Kodak disposable 35mm.) to the site and explored. We have shots of myself standing where it stood with my hand held up at the level she saw its shoulders and lucky enough it was under a major branch of a tree. The propotions of this thing really amazed us when we realized its size next to the tree. It apperantly had approached and squatted at the base of this tree and watched us, and we are sure that it was what had gone through our tent and that we probably had startled it by retuning when we did. After those photos were taken and a search for footprints was given a go ( the earth there was very, very hard and gravelly) we decided to look up by the road as there was a good enbankment running along its length that the thing had to have crossed to get to our site.   About a quarter mile up the road toward the damn from our campsite was a trail as plain as day on the hill side. We got complete photos of the trail and several shots of a very clear print near the asphalt itself on level land. it is about 1 inch deep there where i (at 150lbs) did not leave a trace of one myself. Again, we got several photos of this.",,,,Happened at about 10pm,,15

I still don't know the reason why we woke up, but we did.  We heard a ""crunching"" of the pine needles that sounded like footsteps.  We sat up. We saw clearly by the light of the moon not more than 15-20 feet away between our campsite and the road something that was between 7 and 9 feet tall weighing between 450 and 600 pounds but closer to 500 pounds. It was heading down towards the lake in a direction from the manzanita area. It covered about ten feet in a stride and was swinging its arms in a human-like way.  As it walked it seemed to glide over the ground, moving very elegantly. It appeared to have thick dark fur and to acknowledge us by turning its head toward us but didn't slow. Its head seemed to be pointed at the top, but it was too dark to make out any facial features. As we watched it walk away, I don't know if it was shock or some kind of unseen power causing us to just sit and watch. I turned to my wife and said, ""Did you see that?"" She said matter-of-factly, ""Yes.""  We laid down and went back to sleep. I don't know why we weren't afraid or curious enough to get up and follow its movement. If it were a bear or coyote, I'm sure we would have. But it was more like seeing a deer or elk in terms of our reaction. The next morning, I went over to where we had seen it and tried to follow the path it seemed to take from the manzanita down to the lake. I was unable to find any evidence, no footprints in the mud by the lake, no disturbed pine needles with moisture or dirt showing and no broken branches or hair in the manzanita.  The area though at the edge of a forest reaching to the coast was also a frequently-visited tourist spot and not the sort of place I would ever expect to see such a thing.",,,,"July 4th or 5th, 1993, during the night near the time of a full moon.","My soon-to-be wife and I were camping.

We had set up camp earlier that day and were getting ready to start cooking some dinner. I'm not sure of the exact time but it was just before nightfall. We were not camped close to anybody because for some reason the campgrounds were empty. I think the nearest people were a family that were camped about 300 feet away.  Suddenly, about the time when we were about to eat we heard a loud howl. I call it a howl because I don't know how else to explain it. We both looked at each other and I said to her, ""What the hell was that?"" I'd say it was about 1 mile away, but I'm not sure. I do know that whatever made that sound was big.

06089,1003,2844,1987,Fall,October,CA,Shasta County,,McCloud,Medicine Lake Road,"In 1987, on the night of the first day of the California x1 deer season, myself and my hunting partner were sitting around the campfire a couple of hours after dinner, just relaxing and enjoying the fire.  Down to the south is a small clearing. The moon was out and we noticed some movement in the clearing. The moon gave off just enough light that we saw a figure move slowly across the clearing. Lucky, my partner, thought it might be a bear, so we didn't pay it much mind.  I guess about 10 or fifteen minutes passed, when all of a sudden we heard dry brush breaking up on the side of the mountain. From where the camp is located we were on the east side of the mountain. From that point the mountain goes straight up. Lots of brush and timber. Suddenly, whatever it was started screaming and we could hear it crashing through the brush. It scared the hell out of us.  Then it must have turned and headed uphill. It was still screaming but it sounded like it was getting further away. We were both too shook-up to move, so we just sat there not saying a word. I guess about 20 minutes passed without hearing anything, then all of a sudden we heard a log come flying down the mountain crashing through the brush.  Then it started again: this time the screaming was louder and seemed to be closer. The wind was coming from the north, which was where the spring was. All of a sudden it smelled like something had died. It smelled like a strong urine odor. The smell was overwhelming; it was like somebody had opened an outhouse door or something. And the screaming was louder than ever.  Then all of a sudden it went quiet. We stayed up another hour or so before we decided to turn in for the night. We put some more wood on the fire and got in the tent and got ready to sleep. Then it started again. It lasted about ten minutes then went quiet, but then it really got scary. The light from the fire was pretty bright and showed through the tent. We were both hugging our deer rifles, wondering what would happen next.  All of a sudden we both saw a shadow come between the fire and the tent. It moved slowly and was very large. Then as quickly as it started it ended.  The next morning we searched the area for foot prints but were unable to find any. What we did realize was that our pickup was parked right near the spring and there was a very large log that had not been there the day before. We figured maybe whatever it was didn't like the pickup so near to the only water in the area. It was a very dry year and all the natural springs in the area were dry, so this was the only water for miles.  I have hunted this area for the last 25 years and I have back-packed in the back country all my life. I have heard just about every animal that's out there, but I have never heard anything like what we heard that night. So what do you think? Did we have an encounter with one of the big guys?

But I was raised in Redding, CA. I have hunted all my life, and have heard various critters around and in my tent.  My friend Chris and I were camping out one night during the summer on Mt. Shasta Bally. I figure it was between 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning. My friend and I were awakened by something walking around the pickup, where we were sleeping in the bed of the truck. My first thought was bear, 'cause there are a lot of them in that area. I have had many bears walk around my tent in the Thousand Lakes Wilderness Area near Burney, CA. But this did not sound anything like a bear. It was then that I noticed my friend was awake and looking at me.  He asked me, ""What is that?""   I really didn't know what to make of it. It seemed to be about 40-60 feet away from the truck when we first looked at each other. It circled the truck and when it was near the thicker brush it seemed to come closer. Then it really freaked me out because we smelled a really wild smell. It kinda reminded me of the smell of my dog after he got tore up by coyotes. At the time, Bigfoot never crossed my mind. But my hair totally stood up on the back of my neck. My friend was in the same state.  We were both armed with large-caliber handguns at the time but were too scared to sit up and look. We both just laid there looking at each other. I could hear myself breathing and tried to be as quiet as I could. Something inside me told me that if you sit up you aren't going to make it off this hill. This thing circled the truck for what I would guess to be about between 1-1/2 or two hours, moving closer, breaking branches -- what sounded like on purpose -- and making grunting sounds. Some time before it got light, it seemed to move off to the southwest.  When the sun came and it was light enough to see we got up and looked around the truck. We never got more than about 30 feet from the truck before we noticed disturbed pine needles and broken limbs on the trees about 6 feet off the ground.   My friend and I left that morning and went back into Redding. We told a few friends and my Dad about what happened. He had no answers either for what happened.

We broadcast the alleged Sasquatch ""screams"" and ""howls"" throughout the next few days, including the Bluff Creek Road areas.  Note: Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate, the Fish Lake Road, and hiking to Fish Lake, we broadcast two calls of each sound, the ""scream"" and the ""howl"". Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening.  At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of ""whistle"" or double ""whoop"" (try whistling these syllables ""WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU"") and it was immediately followed by a very intense ""screech"", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman!   Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life.

The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal's eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner.   Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the ""whistle - whoop"" immediately followed by the ""screech"", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night.  At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the ""whistle - whoop"" followed immediately by the intense ""screech"" and this followed again by a lone ""screech"". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it's just that darn kit fox again, and didn't bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this ""chased"" it away), but we then heard the same ""whistle"" and ""screech"" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter.  The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn't feel right with our ""kit fox"" explanation. It just didn't sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then, upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening, he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds, much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before.   On our trip back south, we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that ""... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion."" We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds.","Again, please take note of the fact that we broadcast the alleged Bigfoot screams and howls (available on the BFRO site) immediately prior to our three mile hike to Fish Lake; approximately 6:30 p.m.","There were six of us in the party: four males, ages 32, 23, 15, and 15 and two females ages 22 and 15.

The adults were standing around the fire and the boy had just climbed into his bag in the tent. The third encounter at 5:30 a.m. included the two adult males and the same teenage male.

Each dorm was open to the middle. There were two large windows at the end of the dorm with a door in the middle. I was in the dorm to the south sitting on my bed. There were three kids still up in my dorm. It was about 9:30 or so at night; we were getting ready for bed.  About 10 of us were still up. I heard the kids in the east dorm start to yell and say someone is walking around outside. I heard the counselors say that there was no one outside and go to bed. So I didn't think much of it. A few minutes later they started to yell again. The counselors got mad at the kids for yelling and turned out their dorm lights. I thought they were just goofing off because we were a good 10 miles from town and no one would just be out there walking around.   About 2 or 3 minutes went by when a movement caught my eye out the window . I was about 12 feet from the windows. I looked out the far window from my bed and I saw what looked like someone at the garbage dumpster. There was a big light but it was hard to see. I kept looking but didn't say anything. I didn't want to get in trouble if it was nothing.   It started to walk to the end of the dorm and I lost sight of it because of the door in the middle. I was trying to look around the door from my bed when it looked in the window from the other side of the door. It was bent down looking in the window and I was looking out the window. I was 12 feet away. We looked at each other for about 20 to 30 sec. which seemed like a long time. I could see it was holding stuff in it's left arm and it had brown eyes and kind of a big nose.

06107,1019,2878,1998,Summer,August,CA,Tulare County,"In Re: the Three Rivers sighting in Tulare, CA, August 1998 ",,,"This is not a sighting report. But it is a report.  My name is Steve High. I read the anonymous sighting report you have posted for Three Rivers, CA, in Tulare County. I work in Visalia, the closest major town to that area and am familiar with Three Rivers.  I had business to attend to there last Monday (8/8/99) and afterwards scoped out the area of the story and spoke to 2 locals. The area of the sighting was easy to find as there is only one bridge in that area and it is indeed silver [in color].  The vegetation there is heavily riparian and even unusual. Blackberries, poison oak, willows, sycamore and live oaks are in an amazing and dense tangle. The berry bushes and poison oak is a daunting floor, wall and canopy up to about 15 feet and quite thick and intimidating. Visibility in the field of the vegetation is perhaps 20 to 30 feet. It is possible to be completely out of sight of the road within just 5 feetof the road on either side.  Of note is that this is a riparian habitat and only extends to the bottom of the canyon, which in the area of the bridge would give it a width of perhaps 50 yards. Other places upstream and down, it widens to perhaps 200 yards.This vegetation gives way abruptly to normal foothill trees and grasses with wide and steep expanses of open terrain where a coyote would have difficulty hiding. It is really a quite striking contrast.  Also, there is little to no water above ground in the stream area at this time of year and it becomes drier up through October. The rains begin here in November. My observation is that the vegetation and terrain and the dry stream bed would afford a hidden passage for any animal up to the size of a large elk travelling up or down the canyon.  My speculation is that Three Rivers is about as far down the canyon as any animal would get and still be useen, as this blanket of vegetation falls off rapidly into the highway and opens up to Kaweah Lake. However, going UP the canyon, the area winds about and becomes seriously more rugged and difficult to travel over the next 15 miles and extends up into Sequoia National Park.  There is no hunting in the park and it would be a natural game path for animals as diverse as racoon, deer, black bear, fox and mountain lion to travel. I saw no reason why a Bigfoot could not also take this same trip. What should also be mentioned is that there are three homes rather impossibly nestled in the undergrowth. One is below the bridge and two above. All three showed signs of a full family living there year round. A large animal or even a poacher would have to come out of the undergrowth and cross the road in this vicinity OR risk detection from one of the homes.  Of the 2 locals I spoke to, one was a deputy who had lived up there his entire life and who was actively involved with the search and rescue unit. I asked him plainly what his opinion was of the Bigfoot sighting last August [1998]. He said that it was the first he'd heard of that. Also, that if something like that had really happened that EVERYONE in town would know about it by the following morning. He believed it was likely a story put out by one of the citizens to entice more people to drive up the road as tourism to Sequoia had been slow.  An acountant listening in seconded the opinion. Both men were locals and were certain that there was no truth to it, even as a rumor. I then asked them if they had EVER heard tale of a Bigfoot sighting in Three Rivers. They said they had not. They were in fact incredulous that I might be taking such a thing seriously. They both said that it could have been Deputy B_____ as he was 6-ft-6 and often wandered about town. He was the closest thing they had to a Bigfoot.  So, what we have here at best is a very quiet sighting that was not mentioned to law enforcement or the press, or at worst a fiction. If it were a rumor put out to generate interest and get more people to drive up to the area, it failed.   I will also check with the local newspaper for the dates following the sighting and see what they have to say.  REPORTING LIVE FROM THREE RIVERS, CA - Steve High",,,,,,12
06109,1020,2886,1993,Summer,June,CA,Tuolumne County,Upstream from Bloomer Lake.,Pinecrest,Hwy 108,"The following is an account of the events of the day while conducting surveys for amphibians downstream of Bloomer Lake. The account may be somewhat fragmented in presentation, as I want to provide a narrative that portrays the events of the day. Additionally, I prefer to provide a narrative and let people draw there own conclusions.  First, I recall finding the remains of a fawn in the meadow I wa surveying. Nothing unusual about that, in-and-of-itself...ties-in later.  As I continued to conduct my survey, perhaps thirty minutes or so afterwards, I noticed movement off to my right. What I saw was what appeared to be an animal covered with black, semi-long hair (two to three inches, to guess), walking upright (fully) with a gape somewhat like the current hominids; and approximately five to six feet in height and weighing one hundred seventy-five to two hundred twenty-five pounds.  I saw something move for two or three steps.  It did not appear to go anywhere (but just moved) but of sight.  It did not look at me or react to my viewing, it just simply appeared and then was gone.  To some extent I was not really paying attention to my surroundings, as I was focused on my work; but was enjoying the surroundings in that field sort of way.  I recall thinking that that looked like an upright creature walking through the woods.  I tried to repeat my last movements, to see if what I saw was a play on light and shadows.  I was not able to re-create any likeness of what I had seen - the light and shadow of the forest did not seem to be the source of my observation.  I did not hear anything.  Either before, during, or after, in regards to the sounds that one might hear if someone were walking in the woods stepping on branches or simply rustling the ground.  I did not take an active interest or pursuit, as I was uncertain of what I think I really saw;  I am skeptical by constitution; not only for mythologies, but in general.  Although I did play the event in my mind while I finished my survey.  And occasionally looked in the general vicinity of the area of where I saw the animal-creature-mythological being.  I finished my survey and left the area.  While I was returning upstream, approximately one hundred meters from the meadow, I came across an exhausted buck - two or three year old lying on the ground near the creek.  I was able to approach and touch the deer.  I clearly recall brushing flies off his head and sitting next to him for a couple of minutes and thinking this is pretty cool! I was courious about the deer and did think about what I had seen in the meadow.  I then proceeded upstream again.  Approximately one hundred fifty meters from the buck I came across a mass of tissue, which looked to me like an aborted fetus.  Upon further investigation, I discovered that it was the entrails of an animal.  Very fresh.  I then looked behind me a saw a freshly killed doe.  Her eyes were still clear and there were no flies or maggots on or in the carcass.  As I examined the doe I could find no sign of struggle. I was unable to locate any apparent method of kill by another animal; thinking of a cougar, which usually will bite at the base of the skull or that general area.  I found no such evidence. The carcass was left fully in the open.  What I did notice was that the right leg had been cleanly ripped off from the main body to include a couple of ribs. There was no blood anywhere.  I looked around as my in-the-woods instincts were quite active. There was that six sense of a presence.  I spent awhile running all of the pieces through my head and thought that this was pretty cool and funky.  I then continued to hike out to Bloomer Lake, taking the experience with me.

I joke with people to whom I tell the story that it sounded like wildcats being fed through a meat grinder, but that only captures the high-pitched loudness and intensity, but it was NOT a cat.

Normally when I am there, I see many ground squirrels and chipmunks.  Occasionally, I will notice a few deer, especially near the campsites (from sloppy campers).  Normally, there are several birds in the area too. We arrived late in the afternon and realized that the area was unusually quiet.  No animals were scurrying or foraging. By nightfall, the area was nearly silent.  The only noises were the occasional cars passing on the bridge. We decided to do some exploring up the river after breakfast.  It was still quiet.  we wanted to find good rocks for climbing and jumping into the river. About a 1/4 mile upstream, we stopped at a formation that came up from the banks about 30 to 40 feet.  We free climbed and sat up top to check out the valley. Directly across the river (north facing bank), the rocks were very dark, moss covered and looked fairly tough to climb.  There were also many trees and bushes. There was a deep crevasse near the water level that was 4 to 5 feet wide and full of growth.  we thought that it would be fun to find a way across the river and climb it.  At that moment, my friend Jeff noticed a rustling behind the shrubs in the crevasse.  He got our attention and we all checked it out.  A moment later, we saw a large, hairy figure move into an opening in the crevasse, in a crouching position.  It was crouched on the two rear feet and the front right paw was grasping a tree (to maintain balance?)  The hair was dark brown, and all over the body.  Although we didn't see it stand up as it moved up the crevasse, we could tell that it was well over 6 feet tall, probably closer to 7 feet.  The face of the creature had no snout, but rather a flat face, much like a primate.  The rear paws looked much like human feet, but larger, maybe a foot and a half long.  As it went higher into the crevasse, it entered a darker area thick with trees and manzanita, at which point we lost it.

06023,1038,2935,1969,Fall,September,CA,Humboldt County,"To get to this place, you must float down the Klamath river from Johnson's Bar (I think that is the name of the place, it is or was as far down river as you could drive on the Karok indian reservation road from the confluence of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers)approx. 1-2 miles to the mouth of Tek-Tah Creek on the southern side of the river. Then you must walk up the bar of Tek-Tah Creek about 1/2 miles or so to a place where the creek canyon curves to the east and the creek itself flowed against a steep curved cliff or hillside. The cliff was about 150 yards long and perhaps 50-100' high. the creek flowed against this cliff and formed a deep (maybe 6-7') arched pool about 100 yards or so long.  On the eastern side of the creek was a large bar made of fine dry sand and some gravel.  This bar was as long as the pool, and was maybe 50yards wide at its largest spot. The creek was flanked on bothe sides by steep and desnse timber and brush.  There may have been some debrees on the bar, but I can't remember (It is strange what you can and cannot remember after so many years...).  At the northern end of this bar is where I saw the tracks.",Orick,Probably Johnson road,"I grew up in the woods of the Pacific Northwest.  My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry, A Masters in Zoology, and A PHD in Entomology, and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service, my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman, a hunter and fisherman, who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later.  At the end of each summer season, my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often, we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen.  As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6',2""). The tracks began at the water's edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar.    My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was ""unknown"" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that!    Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does'nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don't know what we really saw that day, but I do know that it scared my dad, and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day, or behaved that way since.    ","Very quiet, and as a small boy in that country, I have many times felt uneasy about the woods around me...like I was being watched.  sometimes I would sit and look and listen for long periods, but never saw or heard any thing.","My father and I were walking inland from our camp at the mouth of the creek, exploring.","After doing lots of research in later life, I learned there are many stories about this area through history, I Was a Wildlife Management student at Homboldt State University, and spent many an hour pouring through the McClarin (SP?)Collection in the library there.

My roommate, my brother and myself were the only ones to stay that night. It was around 1:30 in the morning, when my dog woke me up. She was whining and pacing in the tent. I was trying to calm her down when I heard this sound. I am a serious bigfoot believer and visit the BFRO site often. The sound I heard, which I recognized immediately, was exactly like the HOWL recordings on the BFRO website. When I heard this howl, I instantly sat up. I listened for about 20 or 30 seconds when my brother suddenly sat up and said ""what the hell is that?"". I said I wasn't sure because I didn't want to sound crazy by saying it was bigfoot. The howl went on for another minute or so. When it was over, my brother said ""I have never heard a noise like that. What was that?"" That's when I told him I think we just heard bigfoot. I have since played the recording of the HOWL back to my brother, and he agrees that is what we heard. My roommate never woke up so he never heard it. The entire time the howl was going on, my dog was really freaking out. I know in my heart, I heard bigfoot that night.

06015,1042,2954,1993,Summer,August,CA,Del Norte County,About twenty-five miles outside of Bluff Creek,Bluff Creek,,"As a young person I vaguely remember hearing something about a creature called ""Bigfoot"". I suppose I thought he was something the Indians had conjured up. That is how others seemed to think. Then approximately eight years ago, my sister gave me a book to read during a visit in Florida. I think it was called ""Mysteries of The Unexplained."" I found it to be an interesting book, especially the story about a creature called ""Bigfoot."" I don't remember the details, however, I do remember thinking that there is much more to this so-called myth than meets the eye. Sometime later I saw the famous ""Patterson Film"". A film of a large, heavy, hairy, bipedal subject quickly walking away from a startled cameraman and his horse. My curiosity at that point had me wanting to find out for myself what the truth was. Was this creature real or just a never-ending series of hoaxes and grossly exaggerated stories?   I was in no position at the time to set out on an expedition so I promised myself and a few close friends that someday I would head to the northwest corner of the United States, the reported home of this creature, and answer the question for myself.   Years later the opportunity finally presented itself. I started purchasing enough supplies for a thirty day solo expedition into the northwest. Having recently read three books on the subject of Bigfoot, I thought my best bets were either Washington State, Oregon, Northern California or Idaho. Sightings were consistent in and around the large forests of these states. While purchasing supplies, I picked up the August issue of a camping magazine that, as it turned out, contained an article about backpacking in Northern California. The article stated that you are more likely to see a bigfoot in the forests of this region, than another human being. I took the article seriously. Northern California here I come.   At this point I had read enough material to have a plan that I was confident would bring me face to face with one of these creatures. My plan was not to go after one. It was to give one the opportunity to come to me. I just had to put myself in itsbackyard.   As I made my way into the northwest corner of the state, I realized I wasn't in for a casual stroll through a forest. This forest was thick with undergrowth and either going almost straight up or straight down. One week into my ""hike"" into the back-country I decided to change my plan.   After reflecting on conversations I'd had with the locals, I decided to turn around and head for an area about twenty-five miles from where I was now standing. The people that had talked openly with me about bigfoot activity, all mentioned geographical locations that were in the same general vicinity. They also said that there hadn't been any activity there in the past ten or so years.   After making my way to this new location, I met a man that had lived there for the past thirty years. He said pretty much the same thing everyone else said. I had come to the right place but I was about ten years too late. He then pointed to a spot on my map that to the best of his recollection was the area many footprints and sightings had been reported over a decade ago. That would be my final destination.   At this point my feeling that a bigfoot was no longer in this immediate area was growing somewhat stronger. I considered the possibility that bigfoots had lived here at one time and now lived elsewhere due to the logging activity in this valley some ten to thirty years ago. The forests of this area are large enough to play hide and seek with the entire U.S. Army. Dense forest covers the land further than the eyes can see and these creatures could be anywhere in it. I pressed on. As I made my way toward my final destination I continued to look for signs of something big and heavy leaving some kind of marks on the earth. If they were still around I should find something.   I came across what looked like a bedding area for a creature that could fit a bigfoot's description. It was a bowl like depression in the ground about eight feet in diameter. Everything within this circle was flattened. It was only fifteen feet from a stream. Convenient I thought. There was also what looked like a large print on the side of this bowl headed toward the water. Many small to medium sized trees in the immediate vicinity were bent over or broken off at the base. It all fit, but it could be a bear's resting place, I thought. I left without bothering to take a picture.   That same day I followed an old logging road to a point that it turned into a poor excuse for a rabbit trail. Along the way I found three depressions, about 14 inches long and 7 inches wide, in the soft mossy like growth between two old fallen trees. It appeared to be three steps taken by a very large and heavy bipedal animal. Coincidence, I thought, and pushed on.   By this time on my trip I had seen several bear, a couple of deer and two mountain. Their tracks were all over the place -- especially bear tracks. Bear excrement was also in great abundance. This put me at ease. The better they were eating the less they would be interested in what I was eating. Blackberries are abundant in August, and from the looks of the scat it appeared the bears were taking full advantage of this.   Visibility was usually about ten to fifty yards through the trees. Some of the noises that had been around me on a regular basis were bear and deer that I could not see because of the poor visibility. At the start of this expedition I would reach for the pepper spray at the mere sound of a couple of squirrels playing in the leaves. This behavior was probably due to the fact that a bear had wanted to join me for dinner the very first evening I was in the bush. I'll never forget the sound of him coming towards me through the forest. From that point forward I was well aware that I was carrying approximately forty pounds of bear bait (thirty day food supply) on my back.   As my time in the woods progressed so did my ability to guess what animals were around me by the sounds they made in the brush. Given the opportunity, my eyes would usually confirm what my ears had told me. Since I was on foot and usually on a logging road, I sometimes got extremely close to animals before they realized I was there. One time I had walked to within 35 feet of two bear (not on purpose) that were feeding off to the side of the logging road. They never heard, saw or smelled me. Anyway, I reached my destination and made camp at the intersection of four logging roads.   It was now almost two weeks into the expedition. My plan was to recon the three logging roads that led down to a river. If I could get to the river I might find some nice fresh bigfoot tracks in the sandy banks along the waters edge. I checked out the east road that evening. No luck. It dead ended about a quarter mile from the river just like the forestry map showed. I went back to camp, ate dinner, set out a chem-light and hit the tent. I put the chem-light out in hopes of deterring bear from casually strolling into my little area of operation.   The night passed without incident. I slept like a log. How appropriate. The next morning I checked out the north road. Success, it led right down to a nice open field next to the river. The map I was given by the National Forest Service showed it to dead-end about half a mile short. I'm glad I checked it out. I thoroughly checked the southern bank of the river. No tracks. The northern bank was covered with heavy growth, therefore I did not plan on a crossing to check it out. No tracks and I was sure this was the place that had stirred up much of the controversy some ten to thirty years ago.   As I stood in the field and looked back towards the forest, I decided to check all around the field. I started at the west end. Almost immediately after starting this new search pattern I came across a depression similar to the ones I had recently seen but didn't pay too much attention to. Again there was no detail because of the type of ground. It was a bigger and deeper depression than I thought a man or bear could ever make. I looked further and there was another one and then another one. This time I was sure these were tracks because there were about seven of them strung together in the pattern of a natural bipedal walk. I walked in the tracks. The bottom of the depressions were very hard. As though something of great weight had made them the last time this ground was wet. The distance between the steps was not extraordinary, at an average of about three feet apart. I lost the track momentarily over hard ground and then found it again. It was a consistent track. I figured I was tracking him (I say him when in all actuality it may be a her) the opposite direction he was walking judging from the shape of the tracks.   It was now time for something to happen that I had never considered or read about in any book. I followed the tracks through a soft section of ground to the base of a fifty foot tall pine tree. At the base of the pine tree was an area of ground that looked as though it had been trampled down repeatedly by this heavy creature. It was at that very instant that I realized he had been leaning against the tree. Then it occured to me that if he was leaning against this bark and sap covered tree, there must be hair stuck to it. I moved may face closer and there it was. From a level of about three to six feet off the ground, hair was stuck in crevices and tree sap. I collected some samples and then stood, in the same place that this creature had stood, with my back against the tree. I couldn't help but notice the nice view of the open field next to the river he might have enjoyed while standing in that position. The surface of my back from my buttocks to the area between my shoulder blades naturally was against the tree. If this creature did not put his head against the tree, as I did not do, then I guessed that I was about 2 feet shorter than the Bigfoot that had rested against this tree. I'm 5'10"".   After collecting the hair samples from the tree I continued tracking. I had only gone another twenty yards when I found a similar trampled down area at the base of another pine. This pine however was a much younger tree and the top had been broken off at a height of about 6 feet. The top was lying off to the side. As I looked closer I noticed that all of the branches on the side of the tree directly over the trampled down area were either bent back and to the side or broken off. Hair was all over this tree as well. This creature wasn't resting against trees, he was scratching his back! I continued the track and had only gone another 15 or so feet when I found another young pine that was in the same condition as the one I had just inspected. The top had been broken off at about the 6 foot level also. More broken and bent branches with the telltale hair stuck in the bark and sap. This creature had a definite itch.   Since I was tracking him backwards, I guessed that he must have tried to rid himself of this itch on the two small trees. They probably weren't sturdy enough to satisfy him so he made his way over to the large pine and finished the job. The tops of the small pines that I found lying on the ground still had a small percentage of green needles with the majority looking brown and dying. I don't know enough about trees to make an educated guess as to how long ago the tops had been broken off. I ventured to guess that it was no longer than a month before I stood in the very same spot. Wow, he had been through here quite recently I thought to myself. For some reason I thought he had just been passing through and was no longer in this area. He had been here but was long gone into another valley. Looking back I am not quite sure why I didn't think he was still around. Maybe it was because I wasn't finding any fresh tracks.   I continued tracking him for another three hundred yards or so. He was about as hard to track as an elephant through a corn field. The tracks led to the edge of the thick forest undergrowth at which point I decided to terminate my efforts. Looking back over the area I had tracked, I realized he had stayed just inside the edge of the wood-line the whole way. A smart bigfoot, I thought, unlike the bear and deer that were leaving their tracks all over the place in the wide open field.   As I started to circle back around the east end of this large open field next to the river, I came upon a large pile of excrement. It looked human except for the fact it was a very large pile and the contents were plant-like. As I mentioned earlier, I had seen a lot of bear dung and this looked quite different. Tracks led up to and then appeared to straddle this dropping. Again, this was not the best ground for holding a track, however it did look as though the tracks were made by a large, heavy, bipedal ... bigfoot. I collected a large sample of the excrement and put it into a plastic baggy.   At this point I was feeling pretty good about what I had found and satisfied that this had been a successful expedition even if I wasn't going to see a bigfoot. I had hair and excrement samples -- good physical evidence that a bigfoot is still roaming these woods. I looked around some more and found two more of the same type of piles fairly close to the first one. I remember thinking this must have been his bathroom. He probably would feed all night, get a drink from the river and then relieve himself here. If this was being done by a bigfoot then he seemed to be a creature of habit.   By this time I had been down by the river for a good few hours. I headed back to camp which was located about two miles up the logging road. After dinner I decided to go ahead and recon the west road which was the last logging road I had to check out. It came to a dead end just as the east road had. As I was making my way back to camp, before the mosquitos set in, I noticed something I did not see on my way out. On the north side of this old logging road stood a young pine tree that had been topped at a point about 6 feet above the ground. I immediately looked down at the base of this tree and saw what I knew I would see. The large trampled down area of ground. Those big padded feet had stood right there. I then saw the tracks leading up to the tree as well as the top of the tree lying on the ground off to the side. This time I closely inspected the broken off top of the tree and found hair stuck on it. Hair most likely from the side of the hand that broke it off. I must add at this point that I was keeping a lookout for claw marks in the tracks and teeth marks on the broken off tree tops which would most likely have been left behind if a bear had done this. I was paying attention to this not for myself but for the people that would ask me later about it, when this expedition was done. I had no doubt what was doing this and it wasn't a bear.   Anyway, I didn't find a trace of either claw or teeth marks. This time I kept the broken part of this little pine with hair intact in the sap and put it in a plastic baggy. It seemed as though this creature had a habit of preparing these small pines for back scratching posts in an intelligent and consistent manner. I wondered if other bigfoots did this. I completed my journey back to the tent and realized that the pine I had just collected the sample from was only about 100 yards away. If the other depressions I had seen on the way into this area were indeed tracks as I thought they could be, then bigfoot was leaving too much evidence around here to be just passing through. I figured I was camped right smack in the middle of a bigfoot's backyard.   I had gathered about three chords of firewood in the course of the day which I now started using to stoke up a pretty good sized camp fire. The wood burned quickly because of the fact it was very old and dry. About every twenty minutes or so, I would have to put on another log. This kept the fire at just under the bonfire setting.   Darkness fell without incident. No bears, no mountain lion and no bigfoots. Wow, if my friends could see me now. Bigfoot Bait! Every few minutes or so I would look up the west logging road and then up the east logging road. The north and south avenues of approach were covered by very heavy brush. I could here a lizard coming toward me from either of those directions so I wasn't too concerned about them. Actually it would have to be a pretty large lizard to be heard over the snap, crackle and pop of my camp fire.   I passed some time by sharpening the ends of my walking stick. I got a chuckle out of the fact that my walking stick was about three feet longer than the one I had started with. The further away from civilization I got the softer I walked and the bigger the stick I carried. Everything I had read about and heard about bigfoots told me that they are not aggressive unless shot at. Since I had no gun that wasn't a problem, however I did keep the pepper spray ready at all times just in case. I also tried to stay aware of which direction the breeze was blowing because into it the pepper spray had a maximum effective range of only about two feet.   I continued to look up and down the two logging roads. My camp site was surrounded by complete darkness. I looked at my watch. It was 11:00pm. If I didn't see anything by 1:00am I would hit the tent for a good night sleep. A bigfoot could be miles from here.   Time dragged on as I occasionally looked up and down the two roads. I was sitting on a short log set in an upright position at a distance of about five feet from the fire. My back was to the fire so that it wouldn't impede my vision as I scanned the surrounding darkness. I looked into the darkness of the west road then looked into the darkness of the east road. That is when it happened.   The hair on my back and neck stood straight up. It was the strongest instinctive reaction I had ever had in my life. I was looking directly into a pair of eyes that were looking directly at me. I didn't move a muscle. It was a bigfoot. There was no doubt in my mind that what I was looking at was not a bear, mountain lion, owl or a deer. His eyes were set wide apart and well above where I knew the ground should be. I didn't take my eyes off of them. The Omah, as it is called by the local Indians, was watching me.   Something that I had not spent much time thinking about, until right at that moment, was now of prime concern to me. Had anyone ever taken a shot at this creature? Did this creature, for whatever reason, hold any sort of grudge against human beings? I hoped not. Actually it was more like a quick prayer. I did not want him to direct any ill will towards me at all. It most likely would have been about 750 pounds of powerful ill will.   He wasn't moving. I wasn't moving either, even though my neck was crooked to the left in an uncomfortable position. I watched him and he watched me. The longer I looked into his eyes, the more I got the feeling this was just an intelligent and lonely creature curious to see what I was doing. I began to relax. I had a Mini-Mag flashlight in my left hand and the pepper spray in my right. I wondered if I should shine the flashlight on him to get a look at his body. Again I should point out that this could have been a female, but for the sake of simplicity I will continue to refer to the creature as ""he"".   I opted not to shine the flashlight on him. He came to me, I saw him, and now the ball was back in his court. I waited for him to make the next move. His nocturnal eyes were reflecting the light of the fire I was sitting next to. I tried to make out the outline of his body. I could not. The camp fire illuminated bushes and trees out to a certain distance depending on how recently I had put on a fresh log. Beyond that point of illumination the forest was pitch black. I believe the fire was at a point that a fresh log had just been added when I first looked up and saw Bigfoot.   I continued to observe. The right eye (his left), occasionally seemed to fade in and out as though it was partially blocked by a leaf or branch of the bush I was sure he was standing behind. Earlier, at times when I really had the fire going, the front of this bush would be illuminated for the period of time that the fire was brightest. I couldn't see the bush now but I was sure of it's position.   As I studied his eyes I got the impression they were wet. Liquidy you might say. An effect probably caused by the flickering of the fire they were reflecting. They were a glossy yellow when I first saw them and faded to a real faint yellow (almost white) toward the end of our staring session. Looking back, I would guess that while paying complete attention to him I had neglected the fire and as the fire lessoned in intensity so did his eyes. Occasionally it looked as though he would blink. His eyes would simultaneously disappear for a fraction of a second. It also looked as though his head was shifting from side to side. Similar, I thought, to what I would do if I was trying to observe someone from behind a bush. His eyes looked to be approximately 4 1/2 to 5 inches apart and almost 1 inch in diameter.   Minutes ticked by. My neck was beginning to get sore from the position I was sitting and watching him as he watched me. I casually looked at my watch. It was 12:15am. Then I slowly raised and extended my left arm for the purpose of using my hand as a measuring tool. He didn't move while I did this. He just kept watching. I used the width of my left hand to measure the distance from his eyes to the top of a lone pine silhouette against the night sky in the background. I made a mental note that his eyes were almost directly under and 2 hand widths below the tip of the lone pine. I also made a mental note not to move the log I was sitting on for the rest of the night. I would use this information when the sun came up. After making these observations, I decided to relieve the soreness in my neck and look at him from another position. I slowly spun around in the direction away from him. I didn't want him to think I was getting ready to confront him. I looked up and he was still there watching me. I remember wondering if he could tell if I was watching him. The fire was now slightly behind and to the left of me. From his vantage point, I was most likely silhouette by the fire. His eyes were now getting harder to see. They were there but not as bright. My eyes were getting sore from staring. Then I noticed how dark it was getting in my camp. The fire had barely a flame left to flicker. It didn't take me long to decide that I wasn't going to sit here in complete darkness with a bigfoot just spittin distance away. I slowly stood up to get another log from the pile that was just out of reach. I positioned the log in the fire and sat back down. When I looked up I could not find his eyes. He was gone.   At about 3:15am I thought I could see his eyes again but in a position further back from where he had stood the first time. I was kind of expecting him to come back and see what I was up to. It was hard to tell if he did or not, but I think he did.   Time passed slowly as I waited for the sun to come up so I could check for tracks. I'd thought about doing it with a flashlight but rejected the idea. I would see things much more clearly in the morning.   As the sun came up I sat in the same position I was in when I had measured his eyes from the top of that lone pine tree. According to how everything lined up his eyes would have been centered at the top of the 8 foot bush that stood 70 feet from where I had been sitting. When it was light enough to see the ground fairly well, I made my way over to the area behind the bush. It was an area that was just to the side of the logging road. The ground was similar to the logging road itself which was hard packed gravel. The difference was that the area where I figured a bigfoot should have been standing was covered in a dry, sparse, wheat type of grass. There they were -- the same size tracks I had been finding all along. The tracks were not much more than the grass being squashed, and I do mean flattened, in the shape of a big padded foot. Narrower at one end than the other and approximately 16 inches long and 7 to 8 inches wide at the front of the track. There was a set of tracks leading to a point exactly behind the bush where they then became less distinguishable as though he had been shuffling around. There was however one depression in the ground at a point close to the bush. I guessed it would have been his right foot that made it by its shape. I stood where it looked as though he had stood and found myself directly behind the bush. I looked up to see that if I was about 2 feet taller my eyes would have been at bush-top level.   There was another set of tracks that led away at a slightly different angle than the set that led in. He had come in and left on the east logging road. Nice and quiet. No crashing through the forest. At this point I thought to look for a hair sample around the tracks in hopes of later matching it with the samples I already had. I got down on my stomach and looked. Nothing. I quickly looked over the logging road for more tracks but didn't find anything. It was very hard packed.   Decision time. Do I stay camped here and hope to see a bigfoot in the daytime? This is when I realized I had taken too many pictures the day before and I didn't have anymore film for the camera. Last time that ever happens. Anyway, Bigfoot is nocturnal and daytime sightings are extremely rare. He would probably be somewhere very well hidden and fast asleep during daytime hours. As I mentioned earlier my plan was to stay thirty days in the bush. But now that I had the hair, excrement and tree samples as well as the pictures of the tracks and the experience of last night. I decided 2 weeks was long enough.   I packed everything up and headed out on the east logging road. I was walking at a pretty good pace. Having 17 miles to cover before nightfall with about 60 pounds worth of gear still in my rucksack, I didn't want to waste any time. I'd only gotten about 75 yards up the logging road when I heard what sounded like an extremely large animal thrashing in the woods at a point next to where I was walking. The noise was so close that I didn't think I was going to get the pepper spray I wore on my left forearm out of its holder in time to use it. Then I realized it was running away from me. Crashing through the woods I think best describes it. Large branches snapping as it escaped my nearness.   As I listened to it's escape I tried to figure out what it was. It covered a lot of ground very, very quickly. Through the process of elimination I started guessing. The list of possibilities was short because there are not many animals large enough to have possibly made that much noise. The speed suggested a deer but there was no snorting or hoof sounds that I had previously heard from deer running away from me. Nor did the animal in question sound as ""fleet-footed"" as a deer. The feet were crunching a lot of material underneath them suggesting that they were large surfaced extremities. Could it have been a bear? Possibly, but all the bear I had dealt with to this point were not that afraid of anything. The creature in question was also running away from me on the downhill side of the road and it is my understanding that bear don't run downhill too well. Things happened very quickly, which made it hard to tell, but it also sounded as though the creature I had heard was not getting away from me in a four legged gallop.   There is one thing I am sure of. The noise I had heard was caused by an extremely large and powerful creature that desperately did not want to be that close to me. I will venture to guess that my ole buddy had stayed pretty close to me the whole night and may have even been watching for me the next morning. I call him that because I felt as though we had somehow bonded during my long look into his eyes that night by the camp fire. I had seen his soul and it was a kind soul. My question had been answered.   July 1997-Author's note to the reader: I have made a number of trips into the wilderness since the August 1993 excursion and have yet to find tracks that approached the size and shape of the ones described in the above account.

We were all sitting at the picnic table having lunch and was hearing much crashing in the brush. Not unusual sounds for there are elk everywhere in the park. We did notice however that a ""bear"" or something had an awfully good time with the outhouse toilet paper, as it was strung all over the place. We all were sitting there having lunch and I decided that I wanted to go see where the elk were, maybe see a big bull! So I got on my horse and rode down to where I heard the noise and the trail is cut out on an old logging road and a creek crosses through a culvert to the other side of the road and the water forms a small pool before moving on down into the larger creek below.  I could not tell you how long I was sitting there on my horse watching this creature not more than 30' away trying to get a drink of water out of the pool. It was a challenge, as the sides to the pool were fairly steep. At first, I thought it was a man, then a monkey, and at last my brain registered what I was looking at! Then I seen the finger nail, and it was black and human like. I was looking at an adolescent, possibly baby Bigfoot! It never had a chance to turn and to look at me, as the horse I was on kept getting more and more upset the longer that I stayed there.  I ran back on my horse to my friends and told them in a stuttered manner what I had seen!

Never heard any sounds from him/her. My friend was going to follow and I cautioned her, because I believe that ""Mom"" was close by.   The crashing in the brush we heard was not made by the adolescent looking creature, it was made by something much larger. The creature was silver-gray, had medium length hair (like a bear), black human like fingernails, human like hands (I seen its thumb), was totally covered in hair from top to bottom (I never got to see its face, it was always looking down).  I never have told anyone about the sighting and made my friends promise not to say anything for quite a while.

I was in the area north of mammoth during that same week...maybe 10 miles north of the reports location....  I have been visiting a fly fishing location on the Owens river for five years in a row during the first week of may in the same location...kinda midway between mammoth and june lakes.   My friend and I heard 3 very loud...very long screams on the night of the 3rd of may...  We were backing in my truck to get loaded up to go home the next day...as we backed in next to the cabin, we suddenly heard a terrifying scream about 10 seconds in duration...It sounded like it was right behind the truck..and we had the windows all closed....We just sat there and were saying to eachother ""what the f**k was that????"" We thought we ran over a deer or something big...I immediately turned the truck around and hit the high beams...nothing there so we opened the windows a few inches and just then another scream...this time it sounded off my side of the truck and a bit further away...maybe 20 or 30 yards....once again about 30 secs later one more scream a little shorter this time and further away...it was definitely moving away from us...  At this point we saw some people in a cabin about 200 yards away shining flashlights up and down the mountainside (I questioned one of the ppl in that cabin at 7 am next morning outside as he passed our cabin but he denied hearing anything at all that last night...I KNOW...VERY STRANGE...) i recall him saying it was probably a rabbit...i have heard rabbit screams when they get bitten and it was not that for sure...too loud and long anyway..  Needless to say we were freaked out pretty badly and took 10 minutes or so to get up the (courage) to go into the cabin...hate to admit it but we moved tables against the doors that night....and i moved my bed away from the window to the middle of the room......  Didn't know if i was ever gonna post this but after reading the class B report that occurred during the same week really close by...I didnt know that there were any sightings so far south......  I do have some lingering doubts however that what we heard may have been a mountain lion maybe???  (a link to normal wildlife sounds would be great to at least rule out the possibilities of other noises)    The sound was VERY similar to the ohio bigfoot screams but higher in pitch and what i would call ""angrier"" sounding.....it was a very threatening sound....

Suddenly, we heard a sound none of us heard before, it came from the bottom of the small canyon nearby the ranch.  It was a very loud screech, howl, yelling burst of noise.  It filled the whole canyon up and down the creek bed with its hollaring screech.  We all began to ask ""What is that sound""?  What could be making a sound like that?  We knew it was the sound of an animal but what kind, we couldn't tell.  We were frightend!  As we listened we realized that he was getting closer, we could hear the bushes crush under him as he pushed his way through them.  We could tell by the sound that he was very huge and coming fast.

Doris Lake is roughly a mile and a half hike from the resort of Mono.  Nothing unusual was happening and then out of nowhere, we heard a scream come from across the lake and up in the Mountians.  There were no people or animals that we could see anywhere.  We were in the proverbial wilderness.  My brother and I looked at each other, and unable to readily discern what we were hearing we continued to fish.  I did say to him, if I hear that again I am out of here. Well, a minute or so later, the same scream.  The three of us immediately reeled in and began to run all the way back to the resort, without stopping.    I have listened to various recordings of alleged Bigfoot, and I am struck by how similar these recordings are to the scream that we heard.

(I wish I could give specific directions from here, but it was a long time ago, and I wasn't driving. I remember we made our way to a small beaver pond. There was just beginning to be houses built around here, and I think the area is probably much more developed now than it was 20+ years ago...)","Auburn, California","I don't remember the exact road, I wasn't driving, and it was quite a whlie ago. Off Higway 49 at Alta Sierra, then a couple miles back, by a small beaver pond."," I went with my brother-in-law in the middle of the night, up to Alta Sierra, to sleep for a few hours, then start fishing right at dawn. We were in his flatbed truck that he used for his construction work. I slept in the cab, and he tossed a sleeping bag in the bed of the truck. Around five in the morning (we were both asleep) the truck shook violently back and forth, side to side. The bed of the truck probably moved at least a foot to a foot and a half, about three or four times in a row, quickly. I woke up, and sat straight up, thinking he was playing a trick on me. Right then, the drivers side door opened, and he jumped into the truck, scared out of his wits, screaming ""did you do that"". Obviuosly not, since there I was in the cab, and at that instant, we both realized that no human would have the kind of strength to move the truck that much.  All of a sudden, we smelled a strong, rancid smell... the now familiar skunk/excrement smell. We both realized that whatever shook the truck, was out there somewhere. It was totally black out, no moon, no light of any kind, and we never saw anything.  (We didn't have a flashlight to look around, so we just sat there shaking for quite a while. He didn't get back into the bed of the truck, needless to say!) We couldn't figure out what happened. He said maybe a bear ran into the truck, but I didn't think a bear had the strength, and it wasn't a ""thud"" or whatever, it was 3 or 4 full-strength shakes, then the shocks quickly rocked a little and the truck stopped moving. This is a heavy construction truck, so the suspension is strong enough and stiff enough, that you can pile full pallets of bricks, sand, cement, etc., VERY hard to move that truck with your hands. If you stood on the bed, and jumped up and down with all your might, you would not move the bed anywhere near as much as this moved. I tried it myself. I wish we'd seen something that night, but I never did even equate it with bigfoot until a year or two ago.

This pleased me because I felt that if there was a trail of denial maybe the creatures existence would be kept safe. The incident goes as follows:        Late at night while travelling with my wife in the passenger seat in the front and my 2 kids sleeping in the back we passed by the upper river camp site where I had stayed about 10 years earlier. We had been on the road sometime and were still responsive but tired. As we passed a tight hairpin turn we had not said anything for hours because of the monotonous trip. When we viewed the creature in our headlights, she stated""Did you see that""? In her mid-sentance I stated""What was that"".         I notice extreme detail because as a nurse I have had 5 courses in human anatomy and am in Pharmacy school at UCSF. I've had physiology and numerous science courses. I am the first to admit I am no expert but here is the description. My wife noticed the eyes as reflextive, I did not. I noted the eyes of the creature as black melting into the darkness of it's face. The creature was standing on a rock, balancing very well as if to have a bend in the middle of it's foot.          The rock it stood on tapered to an almost 90 degree angle. When I first saw the creature it was bent over directly facing us. As we came around the corner it very very slowly and methodically pivotted in an upright standing motion as its head looked directly up at us. I will never forget it. It had a black coat with a silvery gray. It appearred ""old"" and my wife afterward felt similar.           The chest and torso were almost cylindrical. The arms extended far, alittle below the pelvis and looked long and cylindrical and thin.           The most amazing thing about this creature was the stealthy survivalist mode. It mimiced the actions of nature. What I mean to say is instead of for instance a human seeing an oncoming car and displaying a startled response by moving irratically and uncontrolled. The creature was very deliberate, meticulous in it's actions moving no more than the branches around it trying not to attract attention. It went from a bent over position to standing upright.  ",There was no odor at all. The feeling I had was that it was elderly.

It wasn't overly remote, just a typical subdivision, it was located on a large green belt, and there was a lot of construction being done on expansion of the subdivision at the time. The area was primarily oak trees, and poisen oak, scrub brush, manzanita, etc. I was sitting shooting the bull with a friend outside on the curb. directly across the street a house was under construction.  We had been talking for quite awhile, when we hear VERY frightening screams. They sounded similar to sounds I have heard on bigfoot recordings, and very much like nothing I had ever heard before, very loud, and very erie. I hadn't ever heard certain animals scream before, so I honestly don't have a base of comparison. We never left, we just sat there sort of freaked, because it WAS a subdivision (albeit at the end of a street) and because we didn't know what it was.

Our plan was to search the streambed for prints by day and listen and observe at night with 1st Gen. passive IR gear.  We conducted about 6 hours surveillance per night, with nothing noted.  Site #1: On second day (10? July) I was checking the north side of the streambed about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite the (Wright Place) when I noticed a flat glade of trees on the south bank and walked across to investigate. After a few minutes in the glade I found a cedar tree with the top twisted off at the 7.5 to 8 foot level. Here the tree was about 2"" thick. Most alarming was that the break, and part of the tree where bark was stripped off, looked moist and fresh; probably occurring overnight, given the dry, and warm conditions. The top of the tree, with a few feet of stripped bark was at the tree's base. No hairs found. I took pictures and brought the top back to my brother.  Later that day, at a second site (#2) about a mile northwest of our campsite, I found a 50 to70 meter, stretch with over 15 trees similarly broken off at between 4 and 8 feet off the ground. I took a few pictures of these.   Over the Labor Day weekend that same year (31 August to 2 September) my wife and I returned to the area. I thoroughly photographed and cataloged the trees at site #2.  We also drove a few miles north of #2, dropping down to the creek east off forest service road 13N01. There (#3) we found more tree breaks and a HUGE pile of dried feces; 2""+ thick ropes with numerous undigested seeds and huckleberries. Most significantly it looked nothing like the abundant bear scat in the area, which was generally much less massive, purple/black and under 1"" thick.  Finally, as we were driving out of our campsite en route home, on forest service road 10NO6, we noticed by the side of the road (#4) a tree that looked like it had been violently twisted years earlier at the 9 to10 foot level and it continued to grow. We took a picture.   NOTE: My interest in the Sasquatch started on the 7th of December 1979. I was a 12 yr. old passenger in my parent’s car, when we saw one.

On the other side of the fence is a logging road that will eventually bring you to the road in question. ",Lassen National Park,A dirt forest road 3/4 mile north of Lost Creek campground.,": In August of 1982, my buddy and I made a weekend trip from Sunnyvale Ca. to Lassen National Park.  Having been there once before four years earlier with a church youth group, and consequently having had a blast, we wanted to camp in the same campground and generally do a lot of the things we had done on our first trip, but without the constraints of adult supervision. We where both twenty years old at this time.   We camped at a place called Lost Creek campground, which sits just inside Lassen National Park along its northern border with Lassen National Forest. On the second day we decided to take a late afternoon hike down an old somewhat overgrown logging road just on the other side of the national park/national forest boundary fence.  We knew of this road and its destination because we had hiked it four years earlier.  This road was lined with tree stumps, and had decades of old logging debris, and it had permanent tire grooves in the dirt.  As this road heads north down the slope from our campground it runs about 3000 ft., until it ends at a fire road running east to west.  We hiked west on this road about 100 yards to where the road runs along side a small meadow to the north. We hiked across this meadow to a creek called Lost Creek, hence the name of our camping site.  After soaking our feet in the icy water, my friend said we should probably head back up to camp as it was getting close to 7:00pm and he didn't want too get stuck down there while it got dark.  We crossed the meadow back to the fire road and started walking east.  We then noticed on the road about 200 yards ahead of us, what at first glance appeared to be a large naked man with a dark complexion, walking away from us.  At second glance I thought maybe he isn't naked but he's wearing a fur coat with a pointy hood.  I remember saying to my friend ""take a look at this guy"". A few seconds later the figure stopped in its tracks and moved to the left side of the road, the whole time with its back to us.  I got the impression that he/it had noticed something and went to investigate.  A few seconds later it continued on its way with a very swift and deliberate gate, arms swinging slightly.  I think what sticks in my mind the most was the bawdiness of the shoulders.  In fact, I remember this character had a well defined hourglass figure.  He/it remained on the road for what seemed like a full minute, the entire time it was walking away from us, with his back to us. The more I watched the stranger I thought the situation was.  Eventually the figure disappeared from view, either around a bend in the road or up into forest to the left, I could not determine the direction.  We didn't say too much about what we had just seen, however we seemed to walk a little more quickly back to camp.  I know I was a little nervous.  I can't really put a size to this figure, because of the distance at which we viewed it, but if pressed, I would have to say it was over 6'5"" tall and about 270lbs., maybe even 300lbs.   The rest of the evening was uneventful, but the next morning at about 5:45am we both were awaken by what sounded to us, to be a series of powerful yelps and growls coming from the general direction of the area where we were hiking the day before.  I don't know if any other campers in the area heard this.   My friend and I never really discussed this event among ourselves; or anyone else for several years, until for some reason, I brought it up once.  We still can't come to an agreement on what we saw or heard.  I've told my wife about the incident, but very few others. I don't know if my friend has told anyone. ","We did find a dead baby deer that looked like it had drowned downstream in the creek, seemed like it was only a week or two old.","Just myself, and a friend..",,"Approx. 7:00pm, just before sunset, the weather was clear.","The area was a mixture of meadow, marsh, and a pine forest with a mountain ridge.",
06045,1281,4182,1978 -1979,Summer,September,CA,Mendocino County,"Standish - Hickey State Park. Across the river, the upper end at the south corner of the camping sites area, there is a trail that goes up over the hill.  ","Leggett, CA",US 101,"I believe this event took place in the late 1970’s to the very early 1980’s.  My best guess is 1978 or 1979.  My father, mother, younger brother and I were camping in a State Park off of Highway 101, in Mendocino County, CA.  Our parents were in their late thirties, I was 16 or 17 and my brother was 10 or 11.  (Of course these ages are approximate and may have been a year or two less or more).  We also had our dog with us, a 60-pound Black Lab - Dalmatian mix.  It was late July to early September and very likely Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day.    The park in situated on both sides of the Eel River, and is for the most part second growth or new growth Redwood forest mixed with other trees and brush of the area.  The main section of the park is next to Highway 101. The far side of the park, away from the highway and across the river, is only open from the end of May to the middle of September.  The rest of the year the access bridge is removed and stowed above the high water line. The far side of the park has more foliage and is frequented by bear, deer, raccoon, skunks and other animals.  We were camping on the far side of the park as far up the hill as possible.  I believe this event occurred toward Labor Day or the weekend after Labor Day for the following reasons; we had something of a ritual in making a final “end of the Summer” trip to this park, the park was very quiet meaning other campers had made an early start home to avoid holiday traffic or were not there at all being the weekend after Labor Day, and on this particular morning my father stayed in camp to do some paper work.  He was a high school math teacher so he usually did lesson plans or other work only in the late summer.  Mom, my brother, the dog and I decided to take a short hike up a trail on the edge of the campground.  The trail worked its way up over the crest of the hills for about two miles and ended above a barn and farm located in a clearing at the bottom of the other side of the hills.  The trail is mainly up hill, makes several cut backs, and passes across two or three unpaved fire roads.  It was a clear sunny day and there was no one else out on the trail.    Our dog liked to take the point position to see the animals ahead.  She was an avid hunter of rabbits and liked to chase deer.  I had often seen her race after deer, taking dangerous inclines and thick brush at full speed.  On this day I do not recall her scaring up anything to chase.  The three of us talked as we went up the trail.  During the last half mile to quarter mile of the trail my mother gave us a serious order to stop. We paused while she looked and listened to an area behind us to our left.  She asked if we heard any thing, but I do not recall if my brother or I did.    We walked on, more slowly now, listening to the forest.  After about 50 yards we felt like we could hear something moving in the woods, behind us to our left, and once again stopped.  The noise stopped when we stopped.  This time we indicated that we did hear it.  The dog was in the middle of the trail listening as well but did not go into the brush to investigate.  We continued on now for another 50-100 yards and we were almost to the crest and the vista area.  Again we thought we heard the noise paralleling us to our left but were not 100% sure.  We all stopped again.  Before we could again acknowledge the sound, there was a loud wooden knocking noise off to our right.  It was 3-4 quick “knock - knock - knock – knock”.  Initially I thought it was two tree trunks rubbing together in the wind.  I looked up to see if I could see anything, but there was no breeze.  Before I could look back down, there was a loud forceful huffing of air coming from the bottom of the tree.  It was something like a growl but not quite.  It was low and guttural, and was a rapid exhalation of air from a very large animal.    Whatever it was, that was enough for us.  It was my mother who spun around and said, “Let’s go.”  No one disagreed and we turned and sprinted all the way back to camp.  I think we covered the two miles without a stop.  Instead of taking the lead, the dog took up the rear position, which in my mom’s opinion was meant to protect us from whatever was behind us.  This was the first and only time we heard anything like that and was the only time we have ever even contemplated running in fear during a hike.  I do not recall any smell in the area.   The incident has never felt right to me and I have thought back to it on several occasions.  My mother has always thought that a bear was stalking us.  (She has always had a very strong apprehension of bears, and always warned us not to get between a cub and its mother, or try to feed a bear or approach any bear.  Nonetheless, we have chased them away on more than one occasion.).  I have heard of stalking behavior in bears before, but only in grizzlies, browns and polar bears – not in the California black bears.  Additionally, the behavior of the animal did not seem like a bear either, and did not elicit the response from our dog that I would have expected for a bear.    I discovered this site about 12 months ago and the similarities of other’s reports with my incident made me think that this was a bigfoot.  Assuming the accuracy of other’s stories, it seems to be a more plausible explanation than being followed by a bear as well, as a better fit with the facts.  I spoke to my mother recently about it and she still felt it was a bear, besides she said, “Bigfoot are only up in the Pacific Northwest.”  I separately spoke to my father about this site and he thought I was pulling his leg.  After I told him that I believed the stories were sincere, and told him some of the common details of the events, he immediately brought up that time “you guys came running down from the trail.”  I did not send this sooner because it is a class B and twenty plus years old already.  I have heard a couple of stories regarding other incidents, but none that I have first or second hand knowledge of.     What may be of interest is that I have seen a nest like the one in Report 2928.  I cannot recall exactly where I saw it but it was within the last 5 years.  It was some where in the Sierras, and I think it was in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I recall being off trail, cutting between lakes, or trying to relocate a trail when I saw it.  In any case it was well off the trail and quite a way from the town or trailhead.  Thinking it was a human’s hand made shelter, I was surprised at the amount of effort that must have went into building the little A frame.  It was tucked in between some tree trunks and the roof was a tight thatch of broken limbs.  It just struck me that a tent would have been easier to move and set up, and would have afforded better protection overall.  I glanced around but did not see any garbage or clothes or other signs of a camp.  There was no smell that I recall.  I was also surprised at how far away the nest was from the town – whoever this belonged to was trying to stay well away from the trail and others.  I guessed that it must belong to someone that really wanted to be left alone, so I went on my way.     ",,3,No,Between 11:00 and 1:30 pm.  Clear sunny day.,"Redwood forest, new and second growth.

06009,1303,4366,1977,Summer,July,CA,Calaveras County,See detailed description,Bear Valley,Hwy 4,"As a new High School graduate in 1977, I planned a camping trip to an area near a boy scout camp (Wolfboro) I was familar with, with my new girl friend.  As an Eagle scout and an athelete (I was recruited to play footbal at Cal) I wanted to impress my friend who loved the outdoors.  The destination was around a dammed watershed called Spicers Resevoir.  There was a dirt (logging road) turn off from Hwy 4, between Bear Valley and Angles Camp.  We drove down this windy dirt road (some 7-15 miles), crossing over a little bridge that crossed a very shallow Stanislaus River (since it was very hot during this summer month), until we reached the end of the road at the dam.  We packed about a mile down the river (?Green waters River) that ran out the bottom of the dam. Only one side of the river had a hiking trail. The other side of the river was a very steep and rocky (e.g. boulders) bank.  This was in the middle of the week, and I knew from my scouting and other trips that very few people were seen in this area.  I was setting up my camp at a clearing next to the river and my girlfriend was fishing.  It was hot, as she had a tangled line while wading in the stream. She yelled up to me that she saw somebody crossing the river above us, some distance, from the other side of the river. Effectively to warn me not to be surprised if they walked past on the trail.  Nobody came down the trail and we forgot the incident. An uneventfull evening passed.  The next day we decided to break camp and go back to the Stanislaus (maybe there was better fishing). This obviously required us to pack back to the car and drive a few miles to the little bridge crossing the Stanislaus River. We parked next to the bridge and found what looked like a fishing trail.  We packed along the trail (if you could call it that) until it was too difficult to hike.  There was alot of little pines close together and there was bigger and bigger granite boulders in our way.  We found a clearing, some 20 yards from the river. I pitched the tent next to a dried creek bed.  The creek bed was a few feet wide and the tent was a dozen feet from it.  The rear of the tent was a few feet from a slope consisting of huge boulders and small pines.  We made a camp fire when evening fell.  It was a clear moonlite night except for the thunder we heard in the distance. I remembered that there could be these rouge thunder clouds. Anyway, later in the evening when we were about to ""turn in"" we heard strong screams coming from the upsteam direction. This was in the direction where we ran out of a hiking trail. The screams occured periodically for 1/2 to an hour.  I rationalized them to be a sick or injured ""range"" cow. During my scouting days I was told that cattle roamed the area and the snow level would effectively heard them down the river valley.  We went to bed and must of only been asleep for a couple of hours when the thunder clouds were close enough to wake us.  I wanted to put some things (e.g. shoes) in the tent so they wouldn't get soaked from the rain.  Once back in my sleeping bag I stayed awake listening, when I heard two foot steps behind us on the rocks of the dried creek bed. I listened more intensley and heard two more step, then a pause. I was really scared, especially since the movie Friday the 13th had been playing. I really thought it was a person stalking us.  I attempted to peer out the back (mesh) window of the tent.  Nothing was said between me and my friend and I didn't want to alarm her, even though I was scared stiff. What I did see was a large silhouette standing and then moving (the two steps at a time) past a tree in that dried creek bed. After, what seemed like a long time, the thing moved/walked deliberately past our tent twords the river. The front part of the tent faced the river and was zipped closed. But this thing, that I believe was Big Foot, started splashing and making that strong high pitched screaming noise at the river.  I then heard foot steps come directly twords our tent and stop right in front of the tent. My hand was on my buck knife.  Then I heard it run away.  I think, after a while, we might have said something like ""did you hear that?, lets get out of here"". Day break was only a short time off and we waited only for the first sign of light.  We hastily packed up camp and drove home. We talked about maybe checking with the ranger, but we didn't.  We eventually tied the ""fisherman"" crossing the river the day before, below the dam, to maybe not being a human but a Big Foot.  This so called ""fisherman"" crossing the river was ""dressed"" in very dark clothing, my girlfriend said, that seemed odd since it was so bloody hot.  I haven't changed my story in 25 years.  You could even contact my old girl friend if you like.","Screams, close contact, 48 hours of stalking",One witness.,"A friend of mine, with a mother that sold real estate in the Angle camp area, had heard that some of his buddies driving their jeeps on the logging roads had sighted what they thought was Big Foot.",see detailed descripton above,"Pine forest, glacial geology, also see descrition",
06015,1316,4445,1985,Fall,October,CA,Del Norte County,"Our camp was located just a short way up Patrick Creek road, maybe just 1000 feet up from Hwy 199.  We camped near the creek in a small clearing.  We arrived at dusk and left just after breakfast the next morning.","Gasquet, CA",Patrick Creek Road,"I live in Humboldt Co. CA and have heard night screams that sounded like an incredibly loud out-of-control frat party in 1985 when a friend and I were remote camping in a heavily wooded unihabited area around Patrick Creek in Del Norte Co. just north of Humboldt.  There were voices in deep male tonations as well as slightly higher and higher still [juvenile?]  I've heard coyotes, bears wolves etc etc. I've also spent time with my sister who was doing her graduate project in anthropolgy on primates at the San Diego zoo.  The closest I can compare the sounds to were Howler monkeys, but controlled.  The voices almost sounded like a dialect but none I've ever heard; like I could almost make out words.  The sounds were definitely primate in nature though definitely not human.  At the time, my wolf-hybrid dog who traveled 300+ miles of the Pacific Crest Trail alone with me and who at the time was a veteran of wilderness encounters and very bold [never would hesitate to tree the largest bear] was trying to bite a hole in the tent to get in.  Once I let the trembling dog in the tent she actually tried to climb inside of my sleeping bag.  She refused to go back outside and remained whimpering in the tent with me until dawn.  At one point in the night, I awoke to hear a very heavy body tramping just outside the tent.  I heard breathing, very deep like in a broad-chested animal.  I dared not go outside until light.  Upon first light I went outside and saw what looked like a stampede had been through our campsite.  The duff was heavily scuffed with signs of foot traffic, which hadn't been there the night before.  I've read a few Bigfoot stories and I've noticed that sometimes the sound of children playing has attracted sighting situations.  I once had a problem with a mentally ill person who was sneaking in my horse barn at night and letting the horses out.  After months of frustration and being told I was paranoid, I got a remote camera that had some infrared capabilities.  As expected, I caught the man and turned in a point-blank video to authorities of him.  If your researchers want a good chance at getting Bigfoot on film, why not set up a week-long or so remote campsite with tents etc. and install a infrared video camera to view the camp.  Have recordings or better yet, actual children squealing in play through the hours of the night.  Review the tapes each day and see what you get.  It worked for me.  From the sound of how intelligent the Bigfoot may be, the more 'natural' you make your camp appear as just a family outing, the more likely you'll get what you're after.  That's why I think using real children would work.  Good luck getting any brave enough to do it though!","Only that many years later I talked with a man who lives up Patrick Creek road whose name I forget, but he is a retired police officer so his credibility can be assumed.  He reported that the sounds we heard then are common to his experience and that he has actually seen Bigfoot families cross the road to where his house is!","Yes, my roomate was with me.

I had to take a side trip across the mountain to avoid some heavy snow and brush. I found this trail that was going up the mountain, where their were large steps in the trail that were throwing my climbing stride off. At this point, this side of the mountain, that I was on, was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind.  Suddenly, I had this very bad feeling. Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.  I then left this out of stride trail. Actually, I ran off the trail feeling terrified of something that was coming down this same trail.  I only got a short way off, when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail, a few yards from me, it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile, then it continued on down the hill.  I didn't look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So, I never saw this animal.  I believe this creature was directing a silent feeling toward me, and I complied.  At this point in my life, I had been a seasoned mountain man, and have had numerous encounters with many kinds of animals including bears and deer, day and night, but nothing like this. With no more fear I returned to the trail feeling fine. I thought of bigfoot right away. This time I paid close attention to detail.  There was no odor or smell, and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter, as I continued to climb on up this mountain. I had expected this trail lead to somewhere, like a cave perhaps, but no, it just ended at a small meadow.  I looked all around, and I could see there was a lime stone ridge out-cropping in the distance, but no signs of a cave.   This encounter was really something to remember, and it was my experience. There isn't any need for the so-called experts to tell me anything, they will just have to get they're own experience. Besides, they're just not in the loop. ","Unusual things, like that feeling of terror, no other sounds, or smells. Also, there were no tracks, because the ground was too hard. The trail was very old and it had been used a lot.

We traveled to Tuolumne County, past Sonora, and camped off of Gargoyle trail above Strawberry on the night of July 4th.  We got to the camp site at about 4:00pm and set up.  My two friends took a nap after setting the tent up but I decided to look around, so I took a hike down a dirt road that lead into the forest.  I was hiking around when my friend came to look for me.  We hiked further into the forest and found a big rock formation and climbed up.  The top was about the size of a football field.  On top we found three stacked rocks and took some video of it.  The bottom rock was big, it came up to my shins and the top two were smaller. Maybe five pounds each.   We then went off into the unknown on the other side of the rock formation.  We had to hike down a lot of boulders and the brush was getting pretty thick.  It was now probably 7:00 or 7:30 so the sun was disappearing and it was getting dark.  As we got closer to the trees I felt as though we were being watched.  Just my imagination I thought, so we hiked on.  This feeling remained and I started to think about how long it would take to get up the rocks we were clibing down. Besides if something was watching us it could have been a bear.  I convinced my friend to go back to camp and we did. At about 8:30 or 9:00 my friend heard rocks being clinked together of in the distance and he said they were answered off in the opposite direction.  I didn't believe him but soon I heard the clinking too.  It was fast but obviously not a wood pecker.  My friend commented that the pattern seemed not human, but I thought it could have been. This banging went on for about twenty minutes and then quit.  We went to sleep later and didn't hear anything all night.  I did notice it was a moonless night and the forest was pitch black.  The next morning we got up and I checked for foot prints around the camp fire were I cleared everything within five feet but saw nothing.  As we were packing up we heard the banging off in the distance again so I decided to try and copy the patterns.  I tried using two rocks and the sound wouldn't carry.  So I then tried a rock on a log.  Finally I settled on a small branch on the log because it sounded to me like what was coming from the forest.  The banging was repititious with a pattern on the end.  I mimiced the banging for about ten minutes before it stopped answering me.  I started packing up again and we heard it another time so I tried to answer it.  No answer.  It did it again, I answered, no answer.  There were long pauses in between my responces and its banging.  I got the feeling what ever it was, wanted to continue it's banging but not in response to me.  We finished packing up and left.","I just had a thought.

06017,1379,4790,1976-77,Fall,August,CA,El Dorado County," I just know the first time was towards Plum Creek, which is still marked on our map. The second time was off a logging road deep in the El Dorado Mountains towards Grizzly Flats",Pollock Pines,Sly Park Road,"Hello my name is Tracie Q., and I am 35 yrs. old.  It has been over 25 years, back in the late seventy's, and my family and I can still remember, to this day, what we saw and heard during our motorcycle outings in the mountains.   At one time, we use to have a cabin off of Sly Park Road in the Pollock Pines area, and we would ride our dirt bikes at least 50 miles a day never coming across the same logging trail twice.  Well, the first time, we were on the trail walking, instead of using the bikes, towards plum creek. My cousins and my sister kept hearing things around us, and I remember my parents saying it was nothing just enjoy the walk. We all would hear branches breaking, and things that a child, at that time, would think to be very scary. Well, this time, we came across a large tree which had fallen within the last few months. This is where myself and my family, still to this day, give Robin my oldest sister hell. Our parents were behind us and my Sister, being a smart ass goes up to look at this jelly like substance.  She puts her finger in it, and tasted it. Well, it was not jelly, but blood, and this is what makes this about bigfoot. Just on the other side of this log, my parents who had just ran up to see what we were all talking about, found this large, and I do mean a large foot print. We realized we were looking at something that was made by a large animal/human. My Uncle who is a big man, he put his boot next to it, and the size of it made his foot look like a kids footprint. If I remember right, they were saying it had to be over size 16.  This was a fresh footprint and the blood was still wet, and all I can remember, was that we all started back towards the cabin like there was no tomorrow.  Now we can't say that the blood was from bigfoot, but I know there was a large footprint.   There was more than one time we came across something strange like that. Another time, I remember we were all on the bikes, and this time, we were either coming from or going towards the old ranger station that was located on the top of the mountain.  Where you were are able to climb the stairs to the top, which was over 3 or 4 stories high. Anyway, I want to say this was towards Grizzly Flats. I kept all of the old maps so that I could share the places we went with my kids one day. Well, there was a little snow left on the grounds that day, and we were taking a rest. My Mom has a thing for being the first one to step in fresh snow, so she goes off doing her thing, and all of a sudden she starts calling my Dad, not yelling, but you can hear it in her voice to get the hell over to her now.  When every body arrived at her location, there was this huge print, and it was human looking. The only thing about it was, that it only had one big toe. It was like it had all the others toes cut off, or just never grew them in the first place.  This print wasn't as big as the first one that I had seen. I think we saw them about a year or two apart, so it was not the same day or anything like that.   There were other times when we would be riding, and you could hear something like voices, but not voices if that makes since.  My Uncle eventually sold the cabin and we stopped going up there.  Now that I live here in the Sacramento area , I have driven back to Jenkins Lake area several times and find myself sitting and wondering about everything that my family and I had seen up there in the mountains.  We never really told anyone about what happened, do to the fact that some people just plan don't believe.  Well I could tell them to stick it, because we are not crazy.  I know what we saw.   We also would come across some old mines up there, and while at some of those places, you could feel like something was watching you.  I have tried to get back to Plum Creek, but a lot of the roads have been closed off.  What a shame there were so many beautiful places that are tucked deep into those mountains west of Lake Tahoe.  Well I feel kind of silly, but I just feel it was time to share these stories with others who believe.  Please feel free to contact me. I could tell you in person and my Mom and Sisters would also, but Dad is no longer with us.  He could have pointed the locations out on our old maps, just maybe my Mom can, but I can't say for sure.  Thank you for taking time to read this.  ",Just what I have told you before.,"On the first occasion, mom, dad, two sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, were the witnesses, and we were all walking.

It was something between a human ""cat-call"" and a cow mooing, a kind of ""Ah-oooo"" that just echoed through the woods. I have served as a docent naturalist for the California State Park System. I have hiked the woods of California all of my life and I have never heard anything like this before. I have heard bear, mountain lion and elk, and this was nothing like those. What impressed us most was how loud it was. We have heard groups of humans in the campground hooping and hollaring and their noise level was not even close to this. We were inside of a travel trailer that had the windows closed up and the noise was clear and strong. We estimated that it had to have come from just across the Smith River from the campground.

We were there for horse back riding which we have done for the past 4 years. The time was approximately 4PM when my wife, son, daughter, Sierra(daughter of the owner of the pack station), and myself became aware of a high pitched ""whooping"" call coming from a distance down the forestry access road approaching the station. The kids started to call back in the same manner. We all guessed it was an approaching hiker or horse back rider approaching the station and calling out for fun. The calling continued for the next 15-20 minutes and was percieved as getting closer. My son became bored with the game and went on to something else to do. The calling continued and I observed that it passed the station and finally grew faint towards the trail head entering a section of the golden trout wilderness area. My daughter went to the access road just adjacent to the mule packing platform to greet the caller upon their arrival. The call grew louder and that was the reason for her appearence at the road at that time. She observed a being and was afraid of what she saw. When I asked later that evening whom had come down the road she was timid in her response. I thought this odd and continued to question her. She was afraid to tell us what she saw because she thought we would accuse her of lying. She has just turned eight. Her description was as follows with little lead in by myself or my wife. We are both physicians and trained in the scientific method. We tried or best not to ""bait"" her answers: The thing was bigger than me (>7 foot) and had a long beard. When I asked her what he was wearing she answered nothing. I then asked her what color was his skin and she answered that she could not tell because he was covered with hair. All over I asked, yes, all over. I then asked if his arms were short or long. She answered long. I asked did he see you and her answer was no. I asked if he made the sound we had been hearing and she stated not at the time she saw him. I then described three different gait patterns by example and she picked the long stride and lumbering type verses the noraml human gait or small steps. She stated that he had a big mouth and walked quickly. She was brief and direct with her answers and I believe she saw something not typically human in form. She has no imaginary friends and has been taught that lying will only hurt the one who lies.

At any rate, we were a very long way from Shaver Lake or any other town, up in the mountains. We parked the car at Courtright Reservoir.",Courtright Road -- the road that leads to the dam at Courtright Reservoir.,"In late August of 1981 I heard a distinct distant wailing animal call similar in character to some of the recordings posted on the BFRO website. I was backpacking with two other people in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization, so now that I have found the BFRO site, here it is.  I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event.  I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent's age. Our destination was the Devil's Punchbowl in California's Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake, about 50 yards from the shore, up against a low, steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner, and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark.  I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast, up a broad open valley, to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe, but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth, round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it, like ""oooOOo, oooOOo, oooOOo"" with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call, making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an ""oooo"" and a ""wow"" sound.  I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me, but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away, up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six ""oooOOo"" segments, and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear, distinct calls made up of about five or six ""oooOOo"" segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute.  Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind, since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing, as there was nothing for it to echo against, and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately.  This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much, since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear, see, feel, or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip, though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that.  Regarding the quality of the sound:  About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green's book ""On the Track of the Sasquatch"" the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard: The unidentified noise is not an ""eeeee"" scream, but more of a long ""whooOooOooOoo"" or ""whoopwhoopwhoop"" at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked, since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard.  I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings, and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls, and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County ""angry Bigfoot"" scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect, it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls, they all seemed to come from the same source, from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer.  To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway. Since then I have heard coyotes, owls, horses, donkeys, grouse, and other animals in the wild, and they don't sound anything at all like what I heard. I have never to my knowledge heard a cougar, so I guess that is a possibility. I have heard that there could have been elk in that area, but I have listened to several elk bugles on the Web, and none of them are remotely like what I heard. Those elk recordings sound like someone trying to make a sound on a saxophone for the first time (dry and squawking), and what I heard had a very smooth ""primate"" quality. ","As we approached Fleming Lake, the trail followed Fleming Creek which was maybe 100 feet below in a ravine. The bottom of the ravine was thickly covered with brush and trees. Down in the ravine we all clearly heard what sounded like a person or a large animal moving at a walking pace downstream (opposite direction of us.) It sounded like someone moving through thick brush and occasionally breaking branches, not even trying to be quiet. Later, my guide told me she thought it was a bear, since she had experience with them in this area before. To this day I have no reason to think otherwise.","No other witnesses. The other two in my party did not hear the sounds, though if they had been standing where I was I am certain they would have.","There are several other reports in your online database from this general area. I read a report on some other bigfoot-related website about three years ago that described a virtually identical call at the same time of day from the same general region on approximately the same date, but I have not been able to find it again. I was really surprised to read that report, since it could even have been the same incident reported by someone else.","Maybe 7:30 in the evening. Dusk. Clear, calm. Not even enough wind to cause ripples on the water. It had been a warm day. Nights were relatively cold, with temperatures dipping to just below freezing. It was dry, since it was late in the year.

Myself and 3 other hunters were getting a last deer hunt in Pacific Valley. We have hunted there many times over the years, however this time we were the only ones left in the valley.  Myself and a friend of mine were hunting together near the Bull run trail head about 5 miles from camp. That day seemed odd after we got up the hill because we could hear no sounds and we could not see anything moving.(We both have biology backgrounds) We were on the edge of a meadow and had somthing like a rock fly over our heads. Be both heard it and I hit the ground. We could not see anyone and the hair started raising on the back of our necks. After checking the area we decided to go down the hill back to camp. The whole way down the trail somthing paralleled us just out of sight. Every few hundred feet it would roll or throw a huge rock down the hill along side the trail. I dropped to a knee a couple of times and swung my rifle towards the area where the boulers were rolling and could not see anything in my scope. We were getting a little shook up at this point and could not figure out what was following us and rolling the rocks. We have never seen any bears while hunting there and ruled out the possibility of a bear trying to scare us by throwing rocks. This continued until we got to the dirt road that took us back to camp. I would say this went on for about 20 minutes or about one mile.   Once we were back in camp we related the experince to the other two hunters. The rest of the afternoon we noticed that no animals were around. We always have had animals around camp, chipmonks, birds,and the occasional pine martin. After dinner we sat around the camp fire and were getting our gear ready for the next day almost bed time when across the creek out of our lantern light a large tree went down. It was a huge crash. It could have been a natural occurence, but with the earlier events we decided that somthing did not want us in that valley.   We decided that no one was going to get any sleep that night anyway so we packed up and left for home.   I have only been back there one time after that and saw through the tent screen somthing pick up my red ice chest with a white lid. I yelled at it and it put the ice chest down and ran off.

They said the noise sounded like something big moving through it. When they moved closer to get a look they said they saw a large hairy ape like creature.

The boys older sister rode her horse down to the spot on two consecutive days, to try and get a look at the creature. On the second day, her efforts were rewarded. In her statement to me she said, ""I was riding north in the river bed on my way home after searching for several hours, when I came to an area where there are two stands of cottonwood and pepper trees one on each side of the trail. My horse spooked and didn't want to go on. I looked around and to my right I saw a tall hairy thing standing there looking at me. It looked at me for about a minute, then I turned my horse and ran her in the opposite direction and took another trail home.""   I investigated the area and though I wasn't able to see the Bigfoot itself, I did find what seemed to be a nest of sorts where the animal had been bedding down. I also found footprints that measured twenty inches by eleven inches. These prints were in very soft deep river sand so I'm sure the size is out of proportion, but maybe this will assist you in determining the animals size. When I asked the young woman about color she said it was a dark brown or black. I didn't think about it after making my own documentation until I read the recent article in the Mohave Daily News Archives.   After reading the article I thought my information might be useful to you. My neighbor took some pictures of the footprints, and though they are of very poor quality I might be able to acquire them for you if you want. Unfortunately my witnesses wish to remain anonymous. "," For the rest of that summer there were times that our saddle horses would refuse to go through the area, and we would have to go way around the spot to continue on our way.","There were six witnesses, nine if you count myself and my neighbors, but we didnt' actualy see the creature.",No other incedents to report at this time.,Both incidents took place between 3 and 6 p.m. Lighting conditions were good.

Shasta.","Weed,Ca.",Hwy 97,"First off, I am a very objective and reasonable person, this is true.  In 1979, my father and I went camping in a remote spot on the summit of Mount Shasta, well away from anyone else.  At approximately 3 AM, on a moonless night, I was awakened by a noise within our camp. At the time, I thought that it was my father up to relieve himself.  Which I thought was odd, since he rarely woke up, because he usually slept like a log.  I was sleeping in the bed of our truck, since my tent was mildewed. I could hear something moving around the truck thru the windows of the camper shell. Something kicked over the ice chest, and I laughed out loud, thinking my father had tripped over it. Yet, I heard no cussing, as he was prone to do.  Something hit the truck with such force, that the truck rocked violently. I thought I it was a joke being played on me by my father.  Then, I heard something that sounded like a rabbit ""screaming"", yet, much louder, almost raspy, yet very piercing.  Needless to say, I was afraid for my life. I grabbed my rifle and waited. Then I heard nothing but the sound of my father unzipping his sleeping bag, and then his tent. He asked if I was OK, and what happened.  He had awakened to the sound.  This may sound like a prank, fuelled by my father, but he would not dent his truck for a prank, that was his baby, and the pay for repairs was certainly not worth the laughs.  The camp was a mess, and we noticed that the eggs were gone. Nothing else.  There were no visible tracks.  We were far from the road, so bare earth was not around.  We had no fire only a camp stove.  I don't know what the significance of the missing eggs was all about, but we did find the carton a ways from the camp that morning.  I doubt any of this will help in your research, but the egg thing still puzzles me.  We, obviously, left that morning.

However I may be able to point it out in a general way on a map.","I believe Willow Creek, Calif.",Deserted and very remote narrow dirt road.,"This incident happened 41 years ago when I was 19 years old. My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I'm not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn't, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn't hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn't see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn't see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine, and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article, and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn't far from where we were camped that night. That's when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch.",none,"Yes, one, my hunting partner.",No.,"Between 6pm and 7pm approx.

",Lake Isabella,Saddle Spring Road,"This was a vocalization by an unknown animal.  The following event happend on the second night of a two night deer-hunting trip. The woods were alive with animals and fresh sign -- scat (bear and deer); prints (bear, deer and cat).  We were both in sleeping bags and in a small two-man tent since 2000 (mainly because the temperature dropped so quickly and it was the warmest place to be). Sometime after 0000 and before 0400, my hunting partner and I were woken out of a sound sleep by these sounds.

06065,1468,5253,1990,Summer,June,CA,Riverside County,"I,m sorry , it has been 12 years. I remember it was in the Dutchmans flats area near Idyllwild. We were camped maybe a mile off one of the trail heads.",Dutchmans flats area by Idyllwild California.,Not sure of the road.,"This is a late report, but however, it is a valid one. What prompted this report is the fact that I now currently reside in Snohomish County Washington and just read about local sightings in my area, surprised at the number of reports. I used to live in Orange County California, and an old girlfriend of mine and I, were camping up in Dutchman’s Flats area, near Idyllwild. We were out-packing, not in a campground.  We were awakened by screams that resembled the sound of a pack of coyotes that had just made a kill right outside of our tent. The screams however had a bit of a deeper tone than a coyote. At the time that is what we thought it was, so we stayed quiet not wanting to interrupt a wild animals meal. The screams and screeches continued for what seemed like an hour, but was probably about 5 or 10 minutes. The screams stopped, but we could hear what sounded like heavy footsteps right outside the door to our tent. We could hear sniffing sounds, and heavy breathing sounds. That is when I got really scared. I know a coyote does not step like a 300+ pound man in combat boots.  I was too scared to even turn on my flashlight, and take a look. (Thinking maybe a bear had just run off what we thought were coyotes). We stayed up, paralyzed all night with fear until the sun came up. Even then there was still a dead silence. No birds, no crickets, nothing.  I was still scared to go outside, but did.  I could see that something was in our camp, due to the scattering of pine needles and dirt around our tent. But there was no sign of a coyote kill, like no blood or fur laying around. What I did see was a pair of big deep footprints going away from our site down into a deeply wooded ravine. The thing, what ever it was, walked upright, and had a 3 to 4 foot gait.  I followed the steps for a few yards down into the ravine while my girlfriend watched. It was still deathly quiet and I had a very eerie feeling that I was being watched. The footprints led right into a thicket and I could see it was a wide path left by whatever it was. I turned and ran back up the hill, packed our stuff up in a big hurry and left.  At that time I was in my early 20's. I am in my late 30's now and take my wife and kids camping all the time up here in Washington, but I do it with a new respect for nature now. ",We did not notice any foul smells like I have read about.,Only myself and my girlfriend at the time.,"I have heard of incidents in the Barton Flats area.Mostly what I have read in your website confirms 12 years later, that what we heard and the prints we saw , were experienced by others during the same time period, in the same surrounding area.That is why I submitted this report.

06093,1474,5284,1979,Winter,October,CA,Siskiyou County,"Hilt, Ca. is located right off the 1-5 freeway in the most northern part of Ca. on the Oregon border. The Fruit Growers Supply Company is located there. ","Hilt, Ca.",1-5,":  This sighting occurred quite some time ago, and I haven’t told a lot of people.  I was a logger for 15 years, in and around northern California, and I was a timber faller, probably 5 years out of that period. Timber falling puts you out in the really remote areas, and we were always the first guys in there to drop the timber. I started working a real thick area, and began working my way back threw the thick woods, my plan was to reach the very back portion of the sale, and then cut my way back toward the logging road.  The first day in there, I had the feeling of being watched, thinking it was just our boss spying on us, so I gave no further thought to it.  The next morning I spotted large tracks in the muddy areas.  It had rained hard that night, so the tracks were not sharp, and they were not from a bear.  Further into the woods, I came up on a flat spot in the faint trail that smelt so terrible, that I almost gagged.  It smelled like wet dog, a very filthy wet dog. Just past this spot is where I spotted what appeared to be human droppings. What was weird about the dropping is they were really huge, not trying to act like an expert on droppings, but the largest piece was about 18inches long, and 3inches in diameter. This really freaked me out, because there was no body else in the area. My partner was working over the other slope, and actually went out another way. The cruisers were out of this area about two months back.  This stuff was fresh looking, about a day or two old, tops.   My partner was a Kroch Indian, and I didn’t know the guy that well, we just paired up for that season. At quitting time, I sort of approached him about the idea of bigfoot, and he said, “they have been in these woods for ever, and my people have told me many stories about them.”  “You white guys just make fun of what ever the Indian talks about, so we keep it to ourselves.” And, that was about it. I guess if I took him to a bar on Friday night, and got his tongue oiled up a bit, I’d have learned a bit more, but I dropped the subject.  We finished the sale and that was it. This area was really secluded with lots of deer sign.  I had a habit of mapping and remembering really good spots for future deer hunting, and prospecting spots that I would use during the winter lay-off.    This particular spot, after logging, was strictly off limits, as it was part of the Fruit Grower Company's land, and after logging they would lock up the roads. It didn’t matter how long you logged their property after a sale it was shut down, and you had to stay out!   Well, hunting season arrived, and I breached the locked gate, and snuck in there for a day of hunting.   I took along my ever-present companion, Pappy, my hunting cow dog.  Him and I were inseparable, because he didn’t know fear, and would attack a grizzly if you didn’t keep him under control.  He had a good nose, and located many a deer that got away from me.   Well, we got into the same area that I had spotted the droppings, and Pappy went on purple alert.  His fur went straight up and he acted totally weird.  He came to a halt and refused to go any further down the trail. I never saw him act quite this way!  Just 100 yards up the hill I spotted movement.  It was crouching down behind a buck-brush bush, and it just crouched there staring at us.  It was completely unnerving!  I realized I was illegally in that area, and this might be another hunter, or a DFG cop ready to bust my butt.  Note, guys were always getting busted for hunting on the California line or the Oregon line. It was just a bad spot, and it was so close to each border, it would be up to that game warded.   Well, I had a Remington rifle, in a 270 caliber, with a 3x9 scope, and not really wanting to aim a rifle at another hunter, I sort of swept the total area, like I was looking for deer.  What I saw chilled me to the bone!  It was not human, and that’s about all that I can really say!  To this day, it looked like a king sized Eddy Munster, and it didn’t look ape like, but it sure as hell wasn’t human.  The eyes, were what got my leg’s going, because I wasted no time getting back to my truck and getting out of there.

At Weldon meadow we stopped for lunch and this was are next area to work.  During lunch, the co-worker went to do a little exploring.  After about 10 minutes the co-worker yelled to me to come and see and ID some wildlife tracks.  These were not wildlife tracks.  We saw what looked something like a human foot track but, it was way to big with a slight distortion in the toes.  The tracks measured about 16 inches long and 7 inches wide.  The tracks looked like the ones I saw last year at the Six Rivers National Forest.  I snapped a picture of the track and looked to see wher the tracks were going.  The tracks followed the barbed wire fence.  The meadow area is used for cattle grazing.  The co-worker asked me what it meant.  I said, ""It's possible that Bigfoot was looking for food or was heading for the spring at the end of the fence.""  We then proceeded to do are work so that we could finish this area and head for the other area.  We finished and headed towards the Woolstaff Meadow Area.  Once down there we proceeded to do are job.  While working on the project, I spotted the same tracks that we saw earlier.  The tracks cut across the trail and headed towards some rock outcroppings.

John Frietas called me and requested that I investigate a report that he had been contacted about. I contacted the lady, JW, and she took me to the spot where she had found a track. She had found the track on Nov. 19 (Tues.), 2002 while picking huckleberries with her sister. She had noticed a large track (13"" X 7"") in one of the few bare places in the area. I might add that it was just a week since it had rained and the ground was still somewhat soft. She went up to the area and made a cast of the track two days later (Thurs.). The track was found in an area next to the road that had been cut with a piece of heavy equipment to form a waterbar to drain the road. Since there was a slight incline to the drainage the weight of the track appears to have been on the downhill side. The cast also picked up a rock approximately 2""X2"" which may have caused the weight of the subject to be on the downhill side, hence the reason for a deeper depression on  the lower side than the place where one would expect it, on the ball and heel area. The local ranger, MS, was going by when she was doing the casting and saw the track. After talking with other people she was encouraged to report the incident.

Lyons Pond is directly across in Training Area 7.  A small creek crosses under Sulphur Spring Rd about 100 yards Northeast of the logging road.,Jolon,Sulphur Spring Rd. & Jolon Rd.,"This report describes a sighting of a large biped primate at Fort Hunter Liggett on the evening of Saturday, February 16, 2002.  I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins.  About 4:30 PM I stopped to look at a creek that crosses under Sulfur Spring Road near Lyons Pond in Area 7 as I drove Northeast.  I learned of the creek that is often used as a wallowing spot, on a guided hunt in 1999.  From the road I could see much recent activity.  It appeared as though quite a few pigs had been wallowing in the small creek the night before.  I drove on about 150 yards and parked my Bronco along Sulfur Spring Road.    I climbed down the 20-foot high embankment to the creek to check the area more carefully.  There were very fresh wallows all along the creek with many fresh droppings in addition. I walked on to Lyons Pond, which was dry, and returned to Sulfur Springs Road.  All of the fresh sign was in Area 7 at the edge of the road, but I was registered to hunt in Area 10/13on the other side of the road.  This is an important distinction at Hunter Liggett.  If you are caught with a loaded gun in an Area you are not registered to hunt, you are banned from the Fortforever.  I solved this conflict by noticing that the pigs appeared to be using a large culvert to cross under the road from Area 10/13 to Area 7.  I decided that I would wait for their return on the 10/13 side of the road.  I positioned myself about 10 yards off, and 20 feet below the road.  My hope was that the pigs would be traveling up the creek through Area 10/13 to Area 7 just after the sun set.  It was about 5:00 PM when I took my position with determination to not move until 30 minutes after sunset.    The first hour of waiting was pretty boring.  Nothing was moving and the forest was eerily quite.  About an hour before sunset the woods began to show signs of life.  A few Blue Jays and Woodpeckers flew by and a few frog croaks resonated from the small creek I was watching.  Closer to sunset I noticed two does moving through the woods and squirrels scampering about.  I knew that if the pigs returned to the creek it would be in those magical 30 minutes after sunset and that time was just arriving!    Much to my disappointment, a blue Ford Ranger also arrived as the sunset.  Two hunters climbed out, grabbed their rifles and walked down a small, grassy road that entered the woods about 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I watched them pass and disappear on the road that was slightly above my hidden sitting position.  My hopes of a pig encounter of the close kind were dashed.  I was certain these hunters would either intercept my prey or scare them away with their movement and noise.    I was heartened a few minutes latter as I saw both hunters returning along the road to their truck.  I watched them carefully with my new Swarovski binocular.  It was about 10 minutes after sunset and without the binocular they appeared as shadows in the darkening forest.  With my Swarovski binocular I could see details of the weaving in the plaid hunting jacket one was wearing and the rifles they were carrying.  They climbed into their truck and drove offleaving me with 15 more minutes of wild pig hope.  These minutes passed slowly as I glassed the forest in search of movement.  The frogs in the creek began a loud chorus that added to the excitement.  There was lots of movement but no signs of pigs.  Chipmunks and squirrels were scampering about and I saw a coyote moving in the distance.  Drizzle started to fall, along with my hopes, as the last few minutes of hunting time expired.  I resolved to return to the same spot in the morning as I put the lens covers on my binocular and gather up my backpack and rifle.  But before I could stand up I saw a flash of light color a few 100 yards back into the forest.  I had no idea what I had seen out of the corner of my eye.  The color was white or silver-gray, not a color that I would expect to see on a wild pig.  I looked off into that direction for a few seconds before seeing another brief flash of the same light colored object.  Both confused and intrigued I watched as repeated flashes of white or silver-gray coloring appeared in the forest.  Whatever it was appeared to be moving and after about 20 seconds of watching I realized that it was moving in my direction along the same road the two hunters had walked earlier.  I believed I watched this creature move through the forest for about two or three minutes before I finally got a clear, unobstructed view of it against a light sky background.  My attitude was relaxed but attentive as I tried to figure out what I was seeing.  Patches of silver-gray flashed through openings in the forest, sometimes high, sometimes low!  My attitude changed to surprise and fright as I saw it take 4 or 5 full steps in a 30-foot clearing along the raised road, 75 feet from where I was sitting.  I was wide-awake, completely sober, free from any medications, and completely focused on this approaching object.  I was alone, watching with my naked eyes, and heavily armed.  I had a Model 70 in 300 Winchester magnum in my hands and was carrying a Tarus Raging Bull in 454 Casual on my belt.    What the hell was it?    I dont know!    It was walking completely upright on two legs.    It was very large.  I estimate that it was 8 feet tall and weighed 800 lbs.  Not 30 minutes before I had watched two hunters cross the same 30-foot opening and had thought how small they looked.  In contrast, I was surprised at how big this creature was.  It was covered with silver-gray hair from its very pointed head to its feet.  The only difference in coloration was a dark facial mask and similar colored palmsbrown or black.  I saw this creature in side profile and could make out few facial features.  What I could see appeared very flat, with little nose or chin protruding.  The silver-gray hair on the head rose about 8 from the top of the facial mask to a pronounced point at the top of the skull.  The head blended into the body without any visible neck in between.  The silver-gray hair on the arms was about 4 inches long.  I could see this clearly as these very long, heavily muscled arms swung in cadence with its fast, uninterrupted, strides.  Bulging back and shoulder muscles flexed visibly under the hair as it strode along the road.  It was not carrying nor wearing anything.  Both hands were empty.  There were no shoes, belt, pack or anything else that would suggest cultural development or advanced intelligence.  Four long, powerful strides in a clear opening against the still light Western sky and it was gone!    I was dumbfounded!  What the hell had I just seen?  It took me about 10 seconds to grab my backpack and start running up the 10 grade to Sulfur Spring Road to get another look.  I slipped to one knee as I scrambled up the hill and pulled my Raging Bull out of its holster as I reached the road.  My heart was racing and my hands were trembling but it wasnt from the runningI was pretty damn scared!  It was 40 minutes past sunset, but I was looking West toward an open field on the other side of the road, the direction in which this creature was headed.  There was nothing movingI couldnt see or hear any sign of what I had just seen.  I walked slowly down the center of the Sulfur Spring Road toward the point where the other road connected.  I called out a number of times to see if anyone or anything would respond.  Nothing did.  After a few minutes I slowly walked backward down the center of Sulfur Spring Road toward my Bronco that was parked about 200 yards East of where I had been hunting.  I jumped in and locked the doors!  I turned it around and slowly drove back toward the Hacienda with the bright lights searching for any signs of movement along the road.  The drizzle turned to serious rain as I reached the Hacienda.  I went directly to the restaurant for dinner and a few glasses of wine.  I chatted with two other hunters seated at the same table.  We exchanged stories of seeing deer and fresh pig sign in the areas we had hunted.  They told me of seeing a flock of wild turkeys run across their path in Area 7, not far from the Hacienda.  I didnt say a word about what I had just seen.  I was sure they would think I was nuts.   I was sure because I was beginning to wonder myself!  I rained hard all night.    A heavy rain continued until about 11:00 AM Sunday morning.    I left the Hacienda an hour before sunrise on February 17th headed back to the spot where I had seen this unbelievable creature.  I parked in the same spot as the day before, and loaded my rifle and pistol before I unlocked the door as the sky began to gray in the East.  I watched the creek for pigs until about 30 minutes after sunrise, then began looking for footprints along the small road where I had seen what appeared to be a silver-gray Sasquatch.  The road was covered with grass and extended only about 200 yards from Sulfur Spring Road to where it dead-ended at a small ravine. There were few patches of bare dirt and no tracks.  Either the grassy road didnt show tracks or the rain had washed them away. Or, perhaps, there had been nothing to leave tracks in the first placeonly an over active imagination!  From the end of the road I slowly still-hunted toward an adjacent ridge.  It was a few hundred feet above the surrounding ground and offered a good vantage point to glass for movement.  While I kept my eyes open for pigs, I was really looking for something silver-gray.  I saw neither.  At noon, I returned to Sulfur Spring Road and walked back into Area 7.  Lyons pond had little new water in it despite the heavy rain over the last 18 hours.  There were few pig and deer tracks on the bare dirt as the heavy rain had washed most of the tracks away.  I saw no sign of any tracks that might have been left by the beast I saw the night before.   ",No additional details to add.,I was hunting alone and no other witness were present,"I have made considerable effort to see if others reported seeing either the Sasquatch or large footprints in the area.    I talked to the wildlife biologist at Ft. Hunter Liggett the following week to see if he had heard any reports or observed any strange footprints in the area.  He had received no reports but did drive out to explore the area of my sighting.  He could find no footprints or other evidence of what I had reported.    I also spoke with two Federal Police officers at Ft. Hunter Liggett to see if they had received any reports of similar sightings, either from military personnel, other hunters, or other police officers.  They had received no  reports.","Forty minutes after sunset on February 16, 2002","The immediate area is a low lying wooded area along a small creek.  The Sasquatch was observed striding along a raised logging road that runs through the  wooded area.

The Fort had been closed since Sept 11, 2001 and Training Area 10/13 had not been used for training or hunting for five months prior to Feb 16, 2002.",16
06009,1497,5477,1978,Winter,December,CA,Calaveras County,"I'm sorry, but I can't recall the specific directions. I can tell you that I was there 5 years ago or so and that the area around Avery had been built up, though the main house and cabin still remained when I found them.  ",Avery,Moran?,"When I was in my early teens, my aunt was dating this fellow who lived in Avery, CA. He was an aspiring carpenter who was trying to build a cabin on his property. Though the main house was already completely built, he took it upon himself to build this cabin directly across the way, on the side of this hill. Running between the main house and the cabin was a creek, which stood at the base of the hill, that had a bridge crossing over it. Anyway, my aunt had decided to move in with him during their courtship and they decided to live in the cabin as it was being built. I had spent my summer there with them that year, but this was my first time being there during the winter. The area (Avery) in which they lived was heavily forested and fairly remote, with the nearest neighbor being several miles away.   Needless to say, it was extremely cold at that time of year. As a result, because the cabin was a work in progress, and only had plastic instead of glass in the windows, the wind would howl through the cabin and we were forced to rely on a pipe stove for heat. On this particular night, I was sleeping downstairs on the couch, with my aunt and her boyfriend sleeping in the bedroom upstairs, and was shivering like mad in my sleeping bag. What's worse, it had snowed the day before, so that also helped to lower the outside temperature and make things miserable as well. I was joined by their two dogs, who slept on the floor beside the stove.  Well, as I laid there in my sleeping bag shivering, I heard a noise outside, like something was walking just outside the cabin. At first, I thought I had imagined it, but then the noise continued, which raised the attention of the two dogs. The next thing I knew, the dogs were growling in agitation and began pacing across the floor. Until this time, I'd never seen the dogs act so hostile. They were both usually mild mannered and friendly animals, and didn't normally exhibit this type of behavior. By now, I was growing scared. Though I couldn't see what was outside, I could hear it, and it sounded big as it moved around. My anxiety that night was increased significantly when I realized that whatever was out there could easily get inside. I was especially nervous because the front door was constructed of several two by fours and plastic, something which even the dogs could break through.   Fortunately, after fifteen minutes of stark terror had passed, whatever was making the noise outside had moved on and things had quieted down again. Because there wasn't anything left to growl at, the dogs returned to their spots on the floor and went back to sleep. I wasn't so lucky, however, and laid awake for another hour or two, wondering if the whole episode had been a product of my imagination. When it happened, it began so abruptly and ended so shortly that I wasn't sure if the surreal event had really occured. It wasn't until the following morning that I knew for sure.   Awaking the next morning before anyone else, I decided to take the dogs outside for a bathroom break. After going down the front steps of the cabin, I began walking downhill when I spotted what looked a set of tracks in the snow. The tracks seemed to start at the crest of the hill, pass by the cabin and then stop at the creek, only to begin again at the other side. Upon close examination, and after walking to the top of the hill, I could see that the tracks actually extended much further. Apparently, whatever it was had come around a bend of trees in the distance, walked across a small valley, crossed (stepped?) over a barbed wire fence, marking the government property line, and continued down the hill past the cabin. The tracks then crossed over the creek as if it had been jumped and continued up the other side.  Now what made all of this so sobering that morning was that the prints looked like large humanoid feet. Each print had five toes and was about 13 to 15 inches in length. The stride between each print was about six to seven feet apart and each print seemed to be about 4 to 5 inches deep, if not more. Even more astonishing was the barbed wire fence that lay directly behind the cabin and what it revealed. I was amazed to see that it appeared as though this thing had just stepped over it without any problems at all, with one left and right print being on each side. What makes this remarkable was that, at the time, this same fence came up to my chest and was about 4.5 feet in height.   As you might imagine, I was very excited about  this, it's not every day that you see a set of huge footprints like this in the snow!, and tried to get my aunt and uncle to come outside to have a look. Unfortunately, though, neither one of them wanted to get out of bed and face the cold, so they never saw the tracks. Shortly after their refusal to come outside, it began snowing heavily and, so, the tracks were covered up. When I talked to their local friends about this occurence in the subsequent times we all got together, they believed me and provided me with stories of their own. One story that I repeatedly heard in particular was how people would pull over in the middle of the night, believing that the wailing that they were hearing was a siren on a police car, only to find themselves alone in the dark night.          Because I didn't want to be embarrassed or ridiculed by people, I've mostly kept this story to myself over the years, only telling my wife and several friends about it. I have, however, been interested in the Bigfoot/Sasquatch developments ever since and feel that this is an undiscovered species. I feel that Dr. Grover Krantz may have been on track when he speculated that this was Gigantopithecus that we're dealing with here. Still, who knows? I only know that what I experienced that night was very scary and very real.   ","I found a set of footprints in the snow the following morning, descending down the hill beside the cabin, that ended at one side of the creek and began again at the other, as though the creek had been jumped across. ",No.,"Yes, but second hand, through stories told by the friends of my aunt and her boyfriend. ",Night. It was extremely cold and there was snow on the ground. ,"Heavily forested.

This trail intersection is several uphill miles above Leavitt lake, which is not really a trailhead but rather the furthest point you can drive south of hwy 108.  The location is easily found using the MAPTECH website.",Strawberry,Hwy. 108,"     My girlfriend and I were finishing a week long backpack trip south of Sonora pass and we spent our last night on a ridge line seperating two deep canyons.  To the east was Kennedy canyon which we had hiked up that day, to the west was another canyon of which I don't know the given name, only that it was very deep and rugged.         I was a bit concerned about our campsite due to the lack of decent trees to hang our food in (this was before bear cannisters, and packers still hung their food in trees to keep it away from bears), they were all very small due to our elevation.  I awoke about 1 a.m. to the sound of rockfall off one of the peaks above us and I sat awake because I thought it was possibly the sound of a bear coming up the nearby creekbed.       Quite suddenly the sound of what I assumed was a large gust of wind came barrelling up the western canyon.  This immedietly struck me as odd as the night was very still.  The sound started as a low moan, growing in strength and intensity and eventually raised in pitch until it resembled a scream bouncing off the mountain walls.  This episode lasted approx. a minute.  As best as I can put the sound into print it went something like this: WHOOOOOOOORROOOOUUUUUIIIIIIEEEEEEEE. I have spent a good part of my life knocking about the wilderness and many years as an alpine mountaineer.  Now I have sat through many a lonley night on a mountain ledge waiting for first light with nothing to do but listen to the wind howl  around the peaks and I've heard it do some pretty strange stuff, but when I heard this noise I was dumbfounded.  Now I was wide awake and all was still again.  No wind whatsoever.  After several minutes the sound began again, building up the canyon until it reached the same screaming crescendo.  I thought ""whoa, that was bizarre"".       Satisfied that our food stash wasn't being raided by a bear I tried to go back to sleep when a very similar moan/howl/scream came up from Kennedy canyon to the east.  The sound was similar in tone and building pitch but seemed fainter, possibly originating from a more distant point.  This is when my girlfriend awoke and I asked her what she thought of the sound, but she wasn't much of a wilderness person and I didn't want to scare her so I didn't push it.",,yes.

06093,1521,5637,1977,Summer,,CA,Siskiyou County,Hike up the trail from Little North Fork Campground.,Sawyer's Bar,A small road between Etna and Some's Bar,"This was summer, 1977, and I lived in Arcata, California working as a volunteer Botanist for Six Rivers National Forest. I was helping out a graduate student at Humboldt State University with his Master's Project (we studied wildlife and plants associated with freshwater ponds in the forest near Willow Creek). One  weekend, my girlfiend and I drove up to the Salmon River to go camping. Its a remote area; it seemed that most people up that way were either miners along the river or fire crews. Near Forks of Salmon (town) we stopped and camped at a pullout near the mouth of the Little North Fork. The next day, we hiked up the stream, went swimming, (even saw a black bear on the trail) and later drove home. The following morning (Monday) my coworkers came to pick me up for the week's work, but I realized while packing that I was missing the telephoto lens to my camera. I remembered using it on the Little North Fork photographing a frog. Figuring I had laid it by the stream and forgotten it, I did not join my two coworkers.  Instead I called my girlfriend, told her what had happened and asked if she would like to return to the Little North Fork. Instead of roaring up there and back (about 100 miles ?) we decided to make a backback trip out of it.  We got up there, hiked the trail, found the lens, but decided to drive further up the paved road to a spot somewhere near Sawyers Bar where a dirt road followed the North Fork and led up to a trailhead where hikers could further follow up the North Fork and into the Marble Mountain Wilderness Area. It was dusk, so we donned packs and got up the trail as far as we could before it got completely dark.  There were no obvious camp sites so we rolled out our bags and literally slept in the middle of the trail. Its old growth forest and we felt pretty alone. The next morning we got hiking again, following the North Fork up a long forested valley.  We passed one other couple that day who had stopped to swim and set up camp. We hiked on another four miles and the trail left the river; it snaked up along the side of the canyon and became more of a narrow path. Always the dirt beneath our feet was covered with the prints of bears.  There were no human shoe prints, just bear prints. It was getting late again and the topo map indicated a stream would cross the trail some distance ahead so we pressed on figuring to set up camp there. We soon heard water. At the crossing we were very tired and were ready to drop our packs, but we both had a very uneasy feeling about the spot and agreed we could'nt spend the night there. Consulting the map again, we found that the trail branched a little ways ahead and an unmaintained primitive path headed up the mountain to a small subalpine lake that we had earlier planned as our destination. The map showed the creek to cross the primitive trail shortly after the path left the main trail. We figured the trail junction might be a good place to camp since it would be close to the creek but hopefully without the feeling we experienced here. Soon we got there and found a small open area between the trees just off the trail, level and large enough for our sleeping bags and a fire.  We dropped our stuff and then went down the start of the primitive trail to the creek (20-30 yards). It was in a steep, boulder-choked, densely forested draw full of log jams left from spring or winter torrents. It was barely a creek now in mid-summer. It was getting dark and again we had a bad feeling about being dwon in the creek bed.  We hurriedly filled our cooking pots with water and got back up to our packs. We were tired.  After cooking, I remember arranging our pots and pans along a log on one side of us and the fire on the other side. I hoped if a bear entered camp during the night he might knock the pots off the log and thereby wake us up.    Sometime in the middle of the night (I had no watch, but the fire was completely burned down to ashes and coals) I awoke to a terrible racket going on down in the streambed through the trees below us. It was the sound of logs and large rocks being hurled and crashing into things. I sat up in the dark and listened. I shook my girlfriend and told her to wake up. She at first buried her head in her bag and did'nt want to hear the sounds.  I was really scared. It was totally dark, I knew there was no one around for miles and I also knew that bears do not go rampaging around throwing things. I also knew darn well that anything living out there could probably smell the remains of our fire. Whatever it was was clearly spending a lot of energy either trying to scare us or angrily searching for something in one of the logjams. After listening for maybe 10-20 minutes (its really hard to know how long) my worst fears were realized. The crashing sounds stopped and soon there was the sound of footsteps coming up the slope directly toward us. It was on two feet and they were clearly audible, heavy footsteps. By this time my girlfriend was wide awake and sitting up in her bag like me listening. Although neither of us said it, we both were thinking of what it had to be. With the fotsteps came the sound of labored breath. Whatever it had been up to in the stream bed clearly had been hard work. I had a sheath knife, but standing to fight seemed out of the question: it was dark, this thing was big, and I was petrified. Just as it came up behind the trees immediately surrounding us, I flicked on my little flashlight, hoping to keep it at bay with the light. The light did not penetrate the darkness beyond the nearest trunks. The creature stopped just behind the nearest tree trunk (15 feet? away) and just stood there breathing. The sound of the breathing was at least seven feet up in the air. I yelled ""Hey!"" with as load a voice as my adrenalin could muster. The breathing paused momentarily and the creature made a ""humph!"" like sound in response, not to me directly, but more to itself. It was very careful to not reveal itself and used the tree to avoid my light striking him. After this, it turned and walked through the brush and trees directly away from us, not back toward the creek but parallel with the creek, heading downstream.  The stride was unhurried. We quickly built the fire back up and stayed awake until dawn. After the sun came up we got some sleep.    After breaking camp we dropped down to the creek before heading up the path on the other side.  I looked around briefly to see if I could see what the creature had been doing, footprints, etc., but I found nothing. I wish now I had gone down or upstream a bit, since the sounds may not have originated at the crossing like I assummed at the time.  We got up to Lake of the Isle (kind of a shallow cirque lake as I recall) in the afternoon.  There were some old campsites there but no recent evidence of people. The place was scoured of firewood, though. I spent a lot of time hauling wood up the hill so we would have enough to last all night.  I also stockpiled throwing size rocks. That night we could'nt sleep.  We would hear rustling in the brush near camp.  I would throw rocks in the direction of the sounds (probably racoons or black bears) and  build up the fire some more.  We did that all night until dawn. We fnally got some sleep.  When we awoke we both decided to bag it and hike out.  We packed our packs and hiked all day. The last mile or so to the car we hiked in late dusk; the thought of spending another night out there was out of the question. We were so paranoid by this time, we jogged the last half mile.     That's it for the incident.  Although we did not actually see the creature, neither of us have any doubt as to what it was. Up until that point in my life, Bigfoot stories were like the Loch Ness Monster: something intrigueing that you sort of wanted to believe in but could never be sure about. For me, the matter of Bigfoot's existence was resolved that night 25 years ago.      ",No smell noticed as some have reported when near Bigfoot. ,One other witness: my girlfriend. I spoke with her once on the phone about 8 years ago but otherwise we are not in contact. She is probably still in the Arcata/Eureka area.,"None in the Marble Mountains.

I was only there for a couple of weeks, and there are mountains in that area, and I dont know the name of them.","Orleans, Ca.",Unknown,"We were in Orleans, Ca., which is close to the Hoopa Indian Reservation.  I was visiting Joe and his Mom, because I have known them since I was about five or six years old.  My friend and I took a horse back ride in Humboldt county, up the Salmon River, with a guide that has cabins there.  He takes care of these cabins, and they are about a three-hour horse back ride, up the river.  I met James, the guide, through Joes Mom, because he was staying with her when I got to California. I cant remember Jamess last name.  We stopped after about an hour and a half of riding, to water the horses, which was the Salmon River.  One of the horses got spooked, and was very jumpy, we thought maybe there was a mountain lion around or something like that.  All three of us saw this large ape looking thing walking along, like he was following us, so James jumps off his horse and threw a rock at the thing, but it wasnt startled.  It just kind of backed off into the woods.  We started to ride again, and we were following the river upstream to his cabins, and the river was way below us when we saw a large black ape looking creature down by the river again.  My friend Joe and I were kind of freaked out by the thing, but James said it had happened before and not to worry about it.   We got to the cabins later on in the afternoon, about one thirty or so.  We grabbed our rods to go to the river, because James said, there is pretty good fly-fishing down there.  Joe and I were down at the river, when we saw this thing again.  We took off and told James that it was on the other side of the river, up the embankment, and in the trees.  So, he grabbed his rifle and went to where we were fishing, but it was gone.  So, that night we were sitting on his porch telling stories about what we thought this thing was, when James said that what we had seen was a bigfoot, and he had encountered him several times before. James continued, saying that it goes up into the mountains several times during the summer.  Then we heard something by the tree line, and his horses were jumpy again. So, we just sat there and waited to see or hear anything again. All we saw was a black outline in the trees, which startled us again.   The next day, James's water supply, from the river, was clogged up somewhere up the river.  He has this thing where the water from the river drains into, and he can get running water to his cabin. So, we all took a walk to see if we could find the problem, and when we found it, the thing that the water drained into was busted up.  It was stepped on by something, and we blamed bigfoot, and thats pretty much it for the story.   James said That it wasnt uncommon to see a bigfoot this time of the year, a lot of people have seen it.  Well, that is pretty much a common thing around there, I guess?  When I got back to North Dakota, I was watching this program on the discovery channel where they were talking about bigfoot, and I saw this same store in Orleans.

If you continue on the road it takes you to Red Lake. Eldorado National Forest.,Woodfords,Hwy 88 and Blue Lakes Rd.,We heard something we can only speculate about but I can still remember clearly the sound.  It was the middle of the night and I was awoken by the sound that started low and went to a high pitch scream.  I'm sure my hair was standing on end.  Then I heard it run off.  It was right outside our tent.  We were camping at Lost Lakes by Blues Lakes.  Our altimeter read about 8400 feet. There were no other people in the camping area around the lake and it was very quiet. It was a week night and the nearest campers were down at the Upper Blue Lake Campgrounds.  My husband is a very sound sleeper and did not hear it and said I must have dreamt it. He almost had me convinced when the next morning our friends who were camping with us and had their tent a little ways away asked if we heard the strange scream. He said he got up and went out side the tent to see what it was an was and saw nothing but there was a terrible smell outside.  We still cannot give credit to another animal and our family are hunters and have spent many hours in the wilderness around the country.  ,,3 of us here the sound and 1 smelt it.,No,"Night, I can't remember if the moon was out.

06017,1565,6130,2000,Summer,July,CA,El Dorado County,See above report.,"Placerville, California",Hwy 50 or Crystal Lakes Road,"During the second week of July 2000 my son (16 years old then) and I had backpacked into the northern part of Desolation Wilderness from the Loon Lake Trail head in Eldorado County, California. Desolation is located in the El Dorado National Forest.  To get to the trailhead you take Hwy 50 east out of Placerville and turn off on the Crystal Basin Lakes Road. Follow this road about 20 miles to Loon Lake and the Desolation Wilderness Trail head parking lot.  From the trailhead we hiked into Rockbound Lake and camped near the outlet of the lake which goes down to Buck Island Lake. We stayed there for four days. This is a place that we backpack into quite often and are very familiar with the area. We usually set up a base camp at Rockbound and then day hike and fish at several lakes in the area as well as the Rubicon River.  Desolation Wilderness is just west of Lake Tahoe and the Pacific Crest Trail.  On our third night there we sitting in camp.  We had fished until dark and it must have been about 9:30 or 10:30PM. It stays lite very late in the summer and we usually fish until dark. At that time we heard a very loud scream that came from the northeast shore of the lake. A few seconds later we heard two more loud screams that came from the same direction. These screams were very loud and not like anything that we had ever heard before. My son and I have both heard mountain lions scream before but these were much louder and very high pitched. We knew that the screams were to loud to be a bird and really didn't know what they were. At that time we didn't even think that it may be a bigfoot. We had both heard about Bigfoot but it wasn't something that came to mind when we heard the screams. Shortly after the screams we went to bed and didn't hear anything else.  The next morning I got up just before daylight so we could pack up and hike back to Loon Lake before it got to hot. My son was awake but still in our tent.  At this time we both heard the biggest loudest roar that was nothing like we had ever heard before. This roar came from the south end of the lake. My son quickly got out of the tent and we just started to ask each other what it was when there was another loud roar from across the lake. About ten seconds later there was another loud roar from way up in the Rubicon River canyon which was about 2 miles away. This roar was muffled because of the distance but was still loud enough to hear. About five seconds later there was another loud roar that came from where we had heard the screams the night before. Five seconds later there was a very, very, loud roar that came from about 50 yards or less behind our camp.  At that time my son and I turned and ran over a small hill behind our camp to see if we could see anything. The area behind camp was fairly open with alot of granite and brush and a few trees. At that time we really didn't know what we were looking for but we thought that we might be able to see something. We hiked around the area and over to a snow pond but didn't see or hear anything else. At that time we returned to camp, packed up our stuff and started to hike  back to Loon Lake.  On the hike back we talked quite a bit about what we had heard and were joking that it was probably several bigfoots communicating with each other. I guess we really didn't want to believe that we had heard a bigfoot but we both knew that there is no other animals in the woods that can make the type of screams and roars that we had heard.   A few days later I drove back to the El Dorado National Forest Ranger station at Camino, Calif. and asked a couple of employees at the counter if they had ever had anyone report hearing any loud roars or screams in the Desolation Wilderness area. One of the employees told me that someone else had reported hearing some loud screams a few weeks earlier. I then told the employees what my son and I had heard and one of them said it sounds like a bigfoot to me.  They also told me that there was someone at that office who takes reports on possible bigfoot happenings and I left my name and number but never heard from anyone.  Over the next couple of years my son and I had told several people about what we had heard but really didn't find anyone else who had heard the same thing.  Most people we talked to had no reason not to believe us but really had no idea how loud the screams and roars were. By this time we both began to believe that we had heard several bigfoots communicating with each other but really had no way to prove it.   A friend of mine then told me about the BFRO Wedsite and we logged on and found out that there were other hikers that had reported actually seeing a couple of Bigfoots in the Desolation Wilderness not very far from where we had camped. We talked about submitting a report but never got around to it.   A couple of months ago the same friend gave me a video tape of the Discovery Channel show about Bigfoot. When I heard the recordings of Bigfoot screams I knew then that we had heard the exact same thing. The only difference was that the screams we heard were louder.  Probably because we were actually hearing them naturally and not on a tape. About a month later my son was able to view the Bigfoot video and when he heard the screams he said, Dad thats exactly what we heard.  We listened to them several more times  and agreed that we would submit a report.   There has never been any doubt in our minds that the screams and roars we heard could not have come from any known animal species that lives in the Sierras. We both wanted to believe we had heard a Bigfoot but really had nothing to compare it to until we heard the screams on the Discovery Channel video tape.  My son was raised in the Sierras and I have lived there for 20 years so both of us are quite familiar with the local animals and sounds. I am also a wildlife biologist and know that the sounds we heard could not have come from a bear or mountain lion. We both now believe that the sounds we heard came from several Bigfoot type creatures or at least an animal that has not currently been identified.        ","Two days before we had hiked over to the Rubicon River canyon and fished the river below Rubicon Lake. This is a large glacier carved granite canyon. After fishing for a while we decide to hike out of the canyon and up to the Pacific Crest Trail to see if we could see Lake Tahoe. Its about a two mile hike and I am sure not many people have ever done this before. This area is a very remote part of the wilderness and we have never seen anyone else in there. As we hiked out of the canyon we started to see very large dry turds (Scat). Both my son and I have seen large piles of bear crap before but these were long and bigger in diameter than a pork and bean can.  We both commented that these were the biggest turds we had ever seen and were joking that if it was a bear it must be a giant one. I broke up several of the turds but there was really no evidence of berries, fir or bone that you usually see in scat. They were just big solid dry turds. Again we didn't have big foot on our minds so we just thought that it was a giant bear turd. Now I believe that they might have been from a Bigfoot. My son and I have considered purchasing one of those remote motion type wildlife cameras and going back in there and seeing what we could capture on film. We are planning another trip into desolation at the end of June and would be glad to take a BFRO investigator with us. We are now both convienced that Bigfoot exists and plan to explore some very remote areas of Placer and ElDorado counties to see what we can see and or find.     ",Just my son and I. We had just come back from fishing and were sitting in camp talking before we went to bed. No campfires are allowed in Desolation Wilderness so we were just kicking back in camp. I think there was a partial moon out but I am not sure. ,A couple of years later we got on the BFRO web site and read about several other Bigfoot type incidents in Placer and Eldorado counties. A couple of them were actually not far from where we live in Foresthill or other areas that we have been to in the Tahoe and Eldorado Nat. Forests.   ,The screams happened between 9:30 and 10:30 PM. It was a clear calm night with no wind. I think that there was a partial moon out. The roars happened just as it was breaking day in the east. Probably about 5:00 or 5:30 AM. It was still clear and calm. ,The incident occurred at Rockbound Res.. Rockbound has alot of granite rocks that come right down to the shoreline. There are scattered pines and firs around the lake. We were camped near where the water runs out of the lake and down to Buck Island Lake.,Wk after 7-4-00

Well, guess what Richard, hes back!!!!   I went to my moms house today and she said that her goose was dead. So, I went  out to look at it and its neck was broken in half, and it had visible punctures in the neck.  I cant tell if its from fingers or teeth.  The goose was laid out perfectly flat with its back feet facing to the rear.  Theres no way it died like that, but looked as if it was laid out like that on purpose.  Then, in the middle of its back was a huge patch of plucked feathers about the size of a large fist, then in the middle of that was a hole about the size of a silver dollar, and there were no insides left in the bird!!! Outside on the ground were a few left over intestines, and two perfectly clean rib bones. I have never seen anything like this except the last time he was here.   Now, not only that, but we have a perfect footprint with four toes.  Also, we found a spot in the weeds at the back of the property, where he laid down, and a path of smashed downed weeds, that look to be foot prints, that are about four to five feet a part!!

A short distance north is Weott.  I have been a country girl all my life and have spent my life close to the land.  I had always been drawn to the forest and had slept outside when ever possible.  The weekends were made for pitching camp and swiming in the Rattlesnake Creek that runs along the foot of the property.  This time I wanted to spend the night along the side of the river by the deep pool we always swam in. The river has giant boulders to lay on and bask in the sun.  Both sides of the river are steep one side one side is so steep and gravel like you cant even climb it.   Well after much pleading with the people I had brought, they said ok we will camp on the river.  They were drinking a bit much and I was not going to touch it because I was worried they may decide to take a swim and sink.  We had fun with a small campfire we sat and laughed until it was late.  We rolled out our sleeping bags on the bank, the river at our feet and the steep cliff to our heads.  The spot we were in had a bit of a ledge high over our heads.I dont know what time it was when I woke up but I am a light sleeper and I heard the gravel over our heads being walked on. I lay still and listened.  It is moving across the top of the ledge toward my right. There is a deer trial that comes down to creek level about 10 feet away from where I am sleeping and I hear this person coming down it.  I was scared and tried to wake the people closest to me without making to much noise.  Then I kicked the person to my left and he snores louder.    To my right, this person (I say person because it was two footed by the sound of it) was no more than 10 feet from me.  It stood behind a willow bush/baby tree it was really just 5 or six canes coming out of the stream bed.  It was dark but I could feel its size when it walked and shook the canes.

It wasn't like a mountain lion grawling and saying ""I'm tough and I can kick your [butt].""  It was broken up into batches of sounds with inflections that I recognized. It was like a person speaking another language but you know they are telling you directly to get the hell out of my house.  I could see glimpses of it when its body moved into the light of the river.  Its right side was as tall as the canes I knew to be 8 foot-ish.  It ranted and raved and stomped and shook the bush.  I smelled skunk and thought ""Great this is all I need, they will bury me without a funeral because I am going to stink."" I finally got my voice and said ""Ok Ok its alright ok ok ."" I did not see or hear it leave.  But I realized at some point it had left.  My encounter lasted only a few minutes but it felt much longer.

She said that it had walked rather slowly, across the road, and that it was definately an animal, like a monkey, and walked like a monkey would walk.

This is a very remote area. We had a great deal of difficilty getting there via rough logging roads. First night, close to the trail head we heard lots of animal sounds which reinforced the remoteness of the area.  The next morning we hiked out of our camp and started heading down to the river. This was not by choice, it was the only trail out of there.  I'll admit to being distressed that day. We got lost twice (once with attendant panic), and ran out of water about 4 to 5 miles in. We were paralleling the Eel River and decending in altitude.  My hope was that would make it to the river but the trail was wiped by a slide. Going down the slope to the river was out of the question as it was far to steep. We hiked a little further to get a better look at the slide. Water was getting to be a real concern now. A few hundred yards from the slide was a trickle of water crossing the trail.  This was the only water we had seen for miles. There was just enough room to get our canteens partly filled.   There was mud where the water crossed the trail and there was a giant foot print in the middle of it. It was maybe 18 to 19 inches long and maybe 6 to 7 inches wide. Water was seeping back into the depession, which gave me a sick feeling like the thing had just been there.  There was no misinterpretation. We both quickly dismissed it as a bear (or human) track. The area up slope of the seep was disturbed but more like a very rough game trail, very steep.  It was late in the afternoon at that point. I made the decision that we would have to spend the night in that location. This elicited howls of protest from my 16 year old brother.

You are either at the main fire, or in your sleeping bag, because it is cold.   As I sat at the fire, I, and only I, looked down to the meadow that has the trail you hike up on. I knew that my two friends were coming up the trail behind us, so when I saw a large man at the base of the trail (less than 100 yards away) I thought it was my large Native American friend with long hair. I did think that it was strange that he was standing in the meadow alone, without a backpack, at two o'clock in the morning.

Then, from the west across the cove, the same sound responded.  The scream from the west continued at least 15 to 20 times.  There were other campsites and I remember seeing someones shadow as they walked to the bathroom.  The screams got louder and the individual hurried to the bathroom letting the door slam behind him.  The screams stopped and did not return.  My wife and two kids slept through the whole thing which surprised me considering how loud the scream was.

All I can say for now is that on the way there, we passed a lake, then turned off onto a road into the woods. It took us a long time, we crossed a very old bridge, and the parking area we left our car at had marmot warnings. Apparently they eat into hoses or belts on the car. People had chicken wire and such to keep them out. ",Mineral King,Mineral King Road,"In May or June of 2001, 3 friends of mine and I camped out near Mineral King at the top of a saddle between two mountain peaks. We camped in the woods,nowhere near a campsite of any kind-near no one else. We had hiked all day to get to that spot.  In the middle of the night-around 1AM I guess- huge rocks (sounded like boulders because we could hear flying debris when they hit) began to rain down around us. None of them seemed close enough to actually hit our tents-and I got up many times to see what could've done it. The geography or lay of the land around us was such that there werent any cliffs or anything like that to create the momentum necessary for such force. The other odd thing is that it went on for a few hours-maybe 3 then stopped. Another discomforting issue was that the whole way up and the whole time pitching camp and even the early evening it was quiet as could be. I never saw anything although on the side of our makeshift camping area I saw one deer-opposite from where the noise came from.  We thought of everything-ice cracking rock,dislodging rock fall-but couldnt answer the timing of it-nor the fact that there wasnt enough of a grade anywhere near us to cause such a thing.   In addition to the rocks-there were very loud cracking of branches. I cant remember if it was the large rocks hitting trees or if it was breaking of branches and large rocks seperately. I never heard any ""screams"" or anything-but something made alot of racket that night.  We were all terrified-and my friend has been an avid hiker who's hiked in different parts of the US and never experienced anything like this. As much as it made an impression on us-no one really likes to talk about it-nor did anyone have an answer.  Two of us mentioned that we should speak to a Park Ranger. Ive been meaning to contact one but I never got around to it. Your title made it easier for me, because I frankly don't know what to think. I can't imagine the force it would take to have rocks rain down around us like that-nor could I possibly justify to myself why it never happened ever around us all day-in the morning, nor early evening or after the incident. I've been interested in going back to that same location-but have fallen out of touch with the only friend willing.",,4,,1:00 a.m.,Pine forest.,

I kept pulling over to let cars in back of me pass.   At about 20 miles or so before Crescent City, I pulled off to allow cars to go by, as I went to pull back onto Hwy. 101, I heard the most horrifying scream that I had ever heard.  I screamed myself and ducked down on my seat, looking up next to my Honda CRV, was a filthy looking gorilla (best as I can describe) it instantly ran into the tree line a few feet away, and vanished into the dense brush.   I saw it for maybe 3 or 4 seconds at a three quarter profile.  I would say it was 6.6 ft to 7 ft high, with a wedged head, and it had very dirty matted dark brown dull hair.

Two friends and I were hunting up an old logging road roughly 2 miles up the mountain across the Eel River from the town.  I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.  After things quieted down I noticed a heavy smell and started looking around.  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up. My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.  It didn't hesitate but turned and walked off into the brush.  I heard trees snapping and the crunch of dry leaves echo away as I ran back to my friends who were still two hundred yards away.

Sometime during the night I was awakened by a huffing sound.  I woke one of the other boys up and we listened to something slowly working its way all around the outside of the cabin.  We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.

My girlfriend & I arrived at Fort Ross Historical Park north of Jenner, CA in Sonoma County on an evening in early July. We decided to camp there at Fort Ross as it was marked as a campsite on our map, but it had no campsites. There was no one at the main house nor around the fort (Old Russian Fur Trading Fort) or on any part of the grounds. We rode to a campground further south but it was too expensive & we decided to ride back to Fort Ross. We camped to the left of the upper parking lot under some monterey pines next to a picnic bench. We ate dinner & went to bed at around 9 p.m.   At approximately 1 a.m., we heard a scream 20 feet to the left of the tent (our heads were facing the ocean).  It was a blood curdling scream of various sounds in succession that lasted at least 9 seconds. It frightned me to my bone marrow. I froze in fear knowing that whatever made the sound was huge. It was so close I could hear the timbre in its throat. Since I'm a musician I realize how much force it takes to make a sound that loud. I've also been camping all my life, & have heard various animals but this was different.  Anyway, my girlfriend said in a whisper ""What the [edit] was that!"" I started to reach for a flashlight and her hand grabbed my wrist with a vice-like pressure so I didn't move. We remained frozen listening to every little noise for an hour. Incedently there were sheep running free everywhere going baah baah & they didn't stop making noise when the scream occured. Finally my girlfriend fell asleep & I remained on guard with my hands hovering around the tent pole to use as a weapon, thinking that at any moment it would stick its fanged head into our tent. At around 2:30am (I guess) I heard another scream down by the fort in the lower parking area. I figured it wasn't coming back so I fell asleep. It didn't occur to me the next morning that it was a sasquatch so I didn't look for footprints.

06109,1697,7097,1977,Winter,January,CA,Tuolumne County,"Take Highway 120 to Evergreen Road to Carlon Station, now a day-use area.",Groveland,Evergreen Road,"It was January 1977, and Little Ruben Rios and Danny Mirales had talked Ruben Hernandez, my husband, into taking them snow camping. Ruben had the experience and the equipment, but was reluctant, because neither Rios nor Danny had much camping experience, and had never camped in the snow.  But winter camping prevailed, and they ended up on the boarder of Stanislaus National Forest and the west side of Yosemite National Park... a place that was called Carl's Inn, then later renamed Carlon. It is located on the South Fork of the Tuolumne River on Evergreen Road.  The road was open in winter possibly due to the fact that it's on the way to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. It's not too far, on the map, from Highway 120 and Yosemite's Big Oak Flat Entrance Station.  It is about 4575 feet elevation. Camping is not allowed there anymore, but we still fish there in the spring and summer. Carlon is in a narrow valley, with ridges on both sides, and the road drops quite a bit between the highway and the stream.   The men had gotten off to a late start because of work, so whatever they could pile into Ruben's Jeep in a few minutes is what they took.  After awhile, tt was getting dark and Highway 120 was deserted, they hadn't even seen another car since Buck Meadows. The temperature had dropped and all three agreed to pull over and set up camp at the next level spot, which happened to be an old logging camp road next to a bridge. That's how they found Carlon, it was not their original destination, just a convenient place off the road. Night had come and it was pitch black by the time they parked. They left the Jeep on a 45 degree up-hill angle on the logging road and blocked it's tires with the biggest rocks they could lift. There were no signs that anyone had been there for a long time, no garbage in the empty can or even footprints in the snow. When they realized they had forgotten their firewood they had no choice but to try to find some in the forest. This was no easy task, because snow was on the ground and everything was either wet or frozen. So they ended up pruning the trees in the national forest... the point being that these three guys were making a lot of noise, tromping around and using their ax, going up the mountain to the top of the ridge, chopping and then dragging tree branches down the mountainside by lantern light.  The fire was made in the campsite fire ring with much effort, after siphoning some gas out of the Jeep. They had a good fire going and dinner was ready to be prepared.  Mostly canned foods, like Vienna sausages and Dinty Moore stew set directly into the fire.  Unfortunately, the Dinty Moore stew can exploded and sprayed food all over them and a 13-foot diameter circle around the fire (this is important to what happened later). After eating what was left of dinner, the three fell asleep inside their tent.  At about 2:30 or 3:00 a.m., the three campers suddenly awoke to the sound of the crunch-crunch of footsteps (BIG footsteps) in the snow and brush.  Then they heard puffing and snorting and grunting from a creature that sounded like a cross between a gorilla and a pig, and then the blood curdling screams, like er er er AAH-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! It was coming from the ridge above the campground!  Then more CRUNCH-CRUNCH, CRUNCH-CRUNCH... PUFF, SNORT, GRUNT... ER ER ERRR AAH-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!  It was walking around the camp along the ridge where they had been earlier that evening getting their illegal wood. The three men froze with fear, the thing was coming closer! They could hear the thing encircling their campsite!!! They knew they were in big trouble! Ruben recalls that it was such a horrible sounding scream it gave him goose bumps all over, but he needed to keep his wits together because the other two where looking to him for answers. He never let on that he was just as scared as they were of whatever it was that was looming over their camp. He also remembers as all this was happening, his mind was racing with the thoughts My God, this thing is going to kill us right here, right now! This is how I am going to die!  When the spring thaw comes someone is going to find the remains of what was left of our camp, shreds of tent material, ripped-up sleeping bags, dented pots and pans, busted-up camping supplies and the dead remains of whatever is left of us. Ruben tried to get the other two to be quiet and calm down. He remembered telling them Whatever it is out there can hear every sound we are making! Shut up!!! One just broke down and cried hysterically, repeating over and over We're going to die! We are going to die! That thing is going to kill us! We're going to die!! The other was asking in a freaked-out voice What is it, Ruben?!?! Let's get out of here! Lets go get in the Jeep and get out of here! Ruben told them there was no way they'd be able to get the rocks away from the tires fast enough, the thing was so close! And even if they could, driving backwards on black ice could roll the Jeep. Ruben told them they would be better off in the tent and remain quiet and wait to see what would happen next.  It screamed that way four separate times, about five to ten minutes in between each scream and was in the campground for about an hour. Ruben had his .22 cal. revolver, but no one would move to see what was out there. They were just waiting for whatever it was to attack their tent. The moon had risen, and they could see the shadows of swaying tree branches through the nylon of the tent. The gun was pointed in the direction of the sounds. Ruben swore that whatever it was out there was going to cast it's shadow down on them with its hairy arms out-stretched, swoop down and yank them out of the tent, tearing everything into shreds!  Ruben knew what all the usual forest animals sounded like.  He had been a Boy Scout and a hunter and fisherman for years. He had seen and heard bobcat and cougar and even chased an angry bear, but he had never experienced anything like this before. He just knew that it was heavy and loud and was walking around on two feet!  The crunching and crashing sound was moving along the ridge now, just grunting as it slowly walked away, without screaming anymore. Then it seemed to cross over to the other side of the ridge, very slowly with an occasional fading gorilla-like grunt. The camp was quiet again.  The rest of the night the three men took turns staying up, holding the gun and keeping watch inside the tent while the other two tried to sleep. When the sky was just beginning to show signs of daylight, the three grabbed all their gear, threw it into the Jeep and left without breakfast. They didn't see any animal tracks around their camp... and definitely didn't want to go towards the ridge to look for any, either. They were in too much of a hurry to get out of there. They didn't talk about it much on the way home, and they didn't tell anyone why they were home so early that morning.  It's been over twenty-six years since it happened, and one of the two guys will not talk about it. He claims that Ruben is crazy and made up the whole story. Ruben says that guy doesn't want to talk about it because he does not want the story getting out that he panicked and was hysterically crying. The other guy still calls Ruben every other Christmas to wish him a good holiday and always ends his conversation with Ruben, do you think that the thing we heard when we went camping was a Bigfoot? Ruben always replies, I don't know, we never saw it. It could have been. But in my husband's mind and heart he knows it was.",No,3,No,2:30 to about 3:30 a.m.,"National Forest, around 4500 feet in elevation, and next to a creek.",

",Weaverville,Highway 299,"In Feb. 1977, a friend, his two older brothers, and his younger cousin and I went backpacking in the Trinity Alps area near Shasta Ca.  I was 17 at the time, and would regularly take time off from high school with my parents permission to go on camping trips as long as I kept my grades up.  I do not remember the exact date's as it has been nearly 26 years since the trip.   My friend and his brother had camped at the area the previous year in the Trinity Alps.  We departed from our homes in Whittier and Pico Rivera, Ca. in a newer model popup camper Volkswagen bus driven by one brother, and a '69 VW bus driven by the other brother.  Since I was not driving I do not recall the highways or road to the campground that we took, and I no longer have contact with my friend and his family. I remember it took around 10 hours to get there.  We had to turn off the main highway on to a dirt road that we had to drive approximately 10 to 15 miles in order to reach the campground.  On the way to the campground on the dirt road there was patches of snow on the ground but the road was very drivable.    About 8 miles on the dirt road we saw an older model VW Beetle coming towards us and we flagged it down, so we could ask the driver what the conditions were like at the campground.  The driver was alone and appeared to be in his mid to late 20s.  He had long hair and a beard and he appeared to be very nervous and distracted when he spoke to us.  He said, ""that the fishing was good along the river"" and thats about all I remember him saying besides ""good luck and for us to be careful"" before driving off.  The whole conversation only took about 2 minutes.  We continued on towards the campground and I remember us kidding to each other how weird the guy had acted as if something had frightened him.    When we got to the camp area we saw that there was no other campers around and no sign of any recent visitors.  We set up camp by parking the '69 VW parallel to the river about 25 feet from the bank that led to the river and by parking the other bus the other way about 20 feet away from the '69 bus with the fire ring between the two vehicles.  The popup VW was parked with it's rear bumper facing the base of a long hill and the front facing the river about 45 feet from the river.  The campground was in a very remote and densely forested area nestled between large mountains in every direction.    We set up camp and decided to go for a hike.  We hiked about five miles into a very primitive area along a trail that was hard to follow in some areas.  After awhile we came upon an old cabin.  The cabin appeared to be abandoned for some time by the shape it was in.  One of the brothers was able to get the door open and we all went inside.  There was a few old cans of food, an old rusted shotgun, old blankets, and an old gas lantern.  There were rodent droppings throughout the cabin, and we figured that it possibly was used by seasonal hunters.  We closed up the cabin, and continued our hike.  It was getting late so we decided to sleep under the stars that night instead of hiking back to the campground in the dark. I remember that it was one of the coldest nights I had ever been through as my frozen boots that I had left outside of my tent attested to in the morning.    We hiked back to our camp the next morning, and prepared breakfast, and just kind of relaxed all day.  Later in the afternoon we took our guns out, and had target practice on some tin cans.  At night we made a huge fire in the pit, listened to music on the tape deck and talked about the day.  We all headed for bed around 9:30 or 10:00 that night. The cousin and I slept up in the canvas pop-top of the bus, while my friend and the older of his two brothers slept below on the foldout bed.  The other brother slept with his dog in the other bus.    Around 10:30 I remember I was almost asleep when I heard a noise coming from far above on the hill next to us.  I then heard something moving at a high rate of speed coming down the hill towards us.  Suddenly the whole bus started rocking back and forth from side to side and at one point I thought it was going to tip over.  I remember hanging on tight and then worrying that if the bus did roll over that I may be crushed if the popup collapsed so I dove for the floor of the bus, and a second later the cousin landed on top of me.  The bus stopped rocking suddenly and I remember hearing over our screams a lot of noise just outside of our vehicle.  We then heard yelling coming from the other brother in his bus and his dog barking like crazy.  We tried looking out the windshield and the side windows but it was iced up and fogged up from the cold.  In a second it was dead quiet again.  We rolled down the passenger side window and called out to the other brother if he was ok.  He said that he was and we all slowly got out of the buses.  The brother in our bus had grabbed his 44 Magnum, and led the way out.  The first thing I noticed was that all of our backpacks had been flung about the camp and that my pack and the cousins pack had been torn open and the contents of our packs was strewn everywhere.  We left everything where it was, and we all crammed into the popup bus for the rest of the night.  Needless to say we barely slept that night.    The next morning we cleaned up the mess outside, and speculated on what could have attacked us. The whole attack lasted only a few minutes.  We ruled out a bear because there were no bear tracks. And a bear would have still been in the area.  I climbed the hill behind our bus that I heard whatever it was that had come after us, and I noticed long skid marks that started higher than I could climb, but I saw no footprints.  I tried to match the stride of the skid marks coming down the hill but couldn't because of the steepness of the hill and the space between the skid marks. We went on with our day by preparing and eating breakfast, and later going for a short hike, and again shooting our guns at targets.  I think that we were all a little edgy after the attack, and I know I kept looking around and over my shoulder whenever possible.    Later that night we again sat around the campfire, and listened to music, and talked.  And again we went to bed around the same time.  We kept the same sleeping arrangements and I remember being jumpy at every little sound that I heard outside.  Once again I remember that I was almost asleep when again I heard a noise coming from high above us.  I then heard something rolling down the hill towards us, and the back of our bus being hit by some large object.  I remember all of us saying something like ""oh no, not again"".  I then heard the same sounds as the night before coming fast at us from the hill.  This time I didn't wait, and I dove for the floor, and again the cousin landed on top of me.  And once again the bus started to rock violently from side to side for about 30 seconds.  My friends brother had kept his 44 near him, and he was waving it around at the windows, and I remember thinking that one of us may get shot by accident.  When the shaking stopped we again heard the other brother yelling from his bus and his dog going nuts.   We tried to see through the iced over windows again with no success.  We exited our bus as soon as we were sure the attacks were over, and called out to the other brother who said he was ok.  I remember the strong smell of something for a short while.  With our flashlights beaming we conducted a brief search of the immediate area.    This time our packs were undisturbed.  We walked to the back of our bus, and there was a large rock about 3 feet in diameter wedged between the rear bumper, and the back tire on the drivers side.  One side of the rock had a very pointed edge to it, and it was inches from the tire.  Whatever had attacked us had thrown the boulder down first before it began its attack on us.  We then noticed that the other bus that the brother was in, which was the closest to the river, had been either pushed or dragged about 5 feet towards the river.  Whatever had attacked us had been very fast and extremely strong, to have attacked so quickly, and to have moved a whole VW bus by itself.  Again I don't remember getting much sleep that night, and the next morning we cut our trip short by packing everything up, and getting the hell out of there.    Ironically the first campground that we came to was the Bigfoot RV Park not far down the main highway if that helps with the location at all. We stayed there for the night and used the showers to clean up, and we slept for 12 hours straight as I recall before leaving for home the next day. I remember not having to drive too far to where there was a statue of Bigfoot in a town called Red Bluff or something like that on the way home.    I am 43 years old now, and I have only told this story to a few people including my wife and three kids.  My friends and I never really talked about it when we got back from our trip only because it was so surreal, and I personally thought that people would think that I made it up, or I was insane or something.  I remember for a long time after the trip that I would still get the chills if I was home alone, and I would think about the attacks.  To this day I really don't have any idea what it was up there.  I have thought about everything that it could have been including that crazy looking guy we met on our way to the campground but it would have been impossible for him to match the strength and quickness that I witnessed those two nights.  I don't believe in supernatural forces, monsters, aliens, and creatures that have never been discovered.    I consider myself an intelligent man, and a reasonable person.  I see enough in the real world as a peace officer to believe in fairytales.  I am only writing about my adventure because I saw the article on bigfoot on AOL, and decided to check out the web site.  I thought it would be fun to share my incident with you.  To this day I am not saying that we were attacked by a bigfoot, because we never saw anything to support that claim.  I am only saying what I am saying, and that we were attacked twice by some unknown man or animal, with enormous quickness, stealth and strength.   The next year my friend went back to the same campground with his brother and another friend, and no further incidences occurred. I am open to any reasonable explanation, but I don't lose any sleep over this after all these years.  I just thought this would interest you.

I was working for the US Forest Service on the Monterey Ranger District (Arroyo Seco Station). One the first things we had to do before the day began was go on a 2-mile fitness run. I dont remember the specific day. I began my run about 8:30 am about 3/4 of the way through the run I began to fall behind the crew. I came to area known as the Abbott lakes area. I stopped to catch my breath. I then heard a noise off to my left on the hillside. The hillside was covered with oak trees, poison oak and thick brush.  The side of the hill was shaded from the sun so I had really looked hard to see what was hearing. I noticed what appeared to a man walking up the hill about 20 feet in front of me. I then realized that this was to tall and to wide to be a person. It was about 8 feet tall. It stopped, turned its head and stared back at me for about 30 seconds. When it turned the whole upper body turned with head. I could not see its face because of the shade. It turned and walked up the hill. I ran back to the station knowing what I seen was not human.  Later that day I was with my supervisor alone and I asked him if he ever seen anything weird near the lakes or the bone yard (trash area). He looked at me and said ""oh you seen it to"" he later went on to tell that other members of forest service seen it to. He states that the season prior that one employee said he seen close up and it was covered with hair. I just blew it off. A month later I was placed on the night shift with one other person.  One of the things was to check the bone yard area for campers. One evening we drove into the bone yard and about 30 feet in front of us was a dark, 8-foot thing walking away from our vehicle.  I did not say anything to my partner until we drove out of the area. She turned to me and said, ""Did you see that?"" I then asked her what the hell is it. She told me she had seen several times in past.  That was the last time I seen it that season.  The 1995 fire season came around and due to budget problems only 3 people were on for the season. This made me nervous because this meant I would work alone 3 days a week. I avoided the bone yard area at all cost when I worked alone.  Halfway though the season a coworker and myself drove into the bone yard area to pick a picnic table.  My partner had a bad habit of wanting to catch a wild turkey for pet so as we drove up he took off running after a turkey that was about 40 feet from our truck. I did not see the turkey once I got off the truck but ran in the direction that my partner was running in.  As I got closer I realized that this was not a turkey we were chasing. As I got a better look at it I realized what I was looking at I only seen the upper body of it because it was walking down a slope. It had turtle shaped head and what appeared to be long tail coming from it. It moved at very fast pace away from us. I backed off, as did my partner.  I took notice of noise that it made as it walked away. I lost sight of it but I could still hear it running through the brush. That was my last season at this station.

On the ridge side it was mostly open forest on the Twin Lake side the brush got thicker. As I was walking I heard a loud two tone whistle [low to high pitch] that was not a bird or any animal I know. The sound came from ground level and behind me to my left. The whistle was loud and sounded in my opinion from a mammal. I turned and called out thinking a hunter [in a place he should not have been][no hunting zone] but no one answered, I whistled back but nothing called. Wondering what it was, I investigated the area 'till i could get no farther, the brush was too thick. I was standing within 10 feet from where the whistle came from, nothing in sight not in the trees on the ground not anywhere, no bird's where flying and no animals in sight either. It was a little spooky but at the time i was cross-country running almost 5 miles a day at 8000 feet as well as boxing training and being a good bow hunter nothing scared me at that time. I was 20 with a good outdoor understanding and other people were the only things that scared me. I remember after I got back to the cabin and asked my Dad what animal out there [if he knew] that whistled like us but much louder, he didnt know of any.    I did not think anything about bigfoot even though I was interested in the subject, I thought they were all up north in the Shasta and up area.

","I used to look across a valley and ridge at Meadow Lake and saw a lush little plateau on the opposing ridge and thought if I was a BF and I was in these parts this would be a good spot to be because of the lush vegetation [looked like a spring close] and the view to see if anyone was coming. I never even thought that there was a chance they would have been in these parts of the sierra. Call it a gut feeling but I get them right quite often, I sat quietly on my side of the ridge once and watched a coyote in the valley below me.

When we arrived, our usual campground was full and we went to a less popular campground which was a few miles further down the road.  By the time we arrived it was already dark and we hurried to set up camp for the night.   Our intention was to camp at this campground for the night and look around the surrounding area for a better site closer to the water the next morning.  Since we has children with us they had to go to the bathroom and my friend (who had spent his youth camping in the area and this campground) took the girls to the closest outhouse while my husband and I started setting up camp.  They came back and everyone was talking about how horrible the area around the outhouse smelled and we laughed saying it was close to end of season and about time to clean out the vault toilets.  Soon we finished setting up tents and unpacking the few things we would need for the night.  I decided I should visit the outhouse and my daughter (who had already been with our friend) said she would show me the way.  We set off down the trail and my husband decided to join us.  We walked down the trail slowly because it was very dark and I had only brought a small flashlight that I always keep in the jeep since we hadn't fully unpacked.  The outhouse was located in an area that was about 10 feet below the trail from the campground.  My daughter finally found the trail down and I flashed my light down into this gullky to look for the outhouse.  I found the outhouse and also found two red eyes looking back at me.  The eyes which were reflected in my flashlight seemed to crouch down.  I  decided that I didn't need to go to the bathroom after all andmade the decision to walk back to camp rather rapidly.  When we got back to camp my husband and friend decided to go back and look around with a better flashlight but found nother although both noticed that it didn't smell as bad as it had before.  The next morning I got up and decided I had to go to the bathroom no matter what was there!  When  got to the outhouse I realized that the eyes I saw reflected back at me had stood about 7 to 8 feet off the ground.

06023,1767,7452,2003,Fall,November,CA,Humboldt County,"Aikens Creek campground, immediately West of Bluff Creek on HWY 96",Orleans,96,"Last Sunday (November 16, 2003) My friend, my dog and I traveled from Portland, OR to Northern California for some late season backpacking. We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive ""skunky"" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time.  Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct ""hoots"" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. ""There."" I said, ""Did you hear it that time?""  ""No."" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of ""hoots"".  ""What do you think that is?"" he asked.  I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond.  As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard ""whacking"" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this ""hooting"" and ""whacking"" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area.  The ""whacking"" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: ""What do you think that is?""  I gave the guarded response: ""I'll tell you what, I've spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I've never heard anything like this."" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word ""Bigfoot"" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive.  Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the ""whacking""; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer ""whacks"" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm ""whack"" from our South/Southwest.   I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note ""whistles"" from the general direction of the distant, hollow ""whacking"" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a ""crack"" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual ""whacking"") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings.  In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the ""amphitheater"" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that ""skunky"" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk.  At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger's Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully.  We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4"" in width) to a point about 6"" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression.  That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night.

I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost.    I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. Im from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.   I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isnt that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear.   But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didnt know up until that point how big it really was.    Now, I had a roommate who was 6'7 and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7'6 tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didnt run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees.   But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didnt move for a good bit, because I was in shock.  After the creature had left, I did the same, once I could get my feet working again.  ",The only thing that i found unusual was when the creature was spooked.

I think I could find it if I went back there but it's hard to explain.  I think the cove was in a northern direction too.,Antler Camp,"I-5, North bound side","My family and I went to lake Shasta CA. To camp at antler camp ground.  While we were there, we went to this cove on the lake and had a picnic.  After the picnic, me and my cousin jimmy and my little sister Kim stayed in the cove to go fishing while everybody else went back out to the boat dock.  After awhile, my sister wanted to go out to the dock to be with my older sister, so I put her on my shoulders and started walking.  About 1/4 mile half way out I started hearing something walking in the woods. I stopped, it stopped. I started, it started. So I kept walking. I dropped my sister off and started heading back.  A little way in and I started hearing the footsteps again. Now they were closer and I could see something in the shadows. As I kept walking, it kept getting closer. I stopped again and all of a sudden, it came crashing through the brush straight for me. I just stood there, looking at it then it stopped about 5 feet from me and I could plainly see what was standing there, but I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I remember noticing it had big reddish brown eyes that seemed to stare right through me.  It gave me the creeps. Then I noticed it had big muscular arms and huge hands. Then I looked down and saw big feet. Then I started scanning up and saw some big calves and thighs. It was definitely a male and was dark brownish black in color. I just stood there looking at him and then I said to my cousin jimmy, who was about 10 to 15 feet away from me, look and pointed at it. He took one look and screamed, and then he jumped into the lake.  I gave a yell and did the same. We swam out into the center of the cove and the creature stood there watching us. My cousin swam to the dock but I stayed. I was totally curious as to what it was but scared at the same time. Then it looked toward the back of the cove like it was startled and it ran up at least a 40 to 45% hill through brush and trees.  It covered at least a couple hundred feet in what seemed like 2 or 3 seconds and was gone.   I heard and saw some people coming down a trail from a cabin up on the hill. When they got close, I asked them if they ever heard of bigfoot.  They said, yeah, they come around are cabin once in a while.  ",Not really.,Just me and my cousin were there.

06093,1802,7637,2002,Fall,October,CA,Siskiyou County,,Yreka ,,"Last year when I was 12  I saw a Creature. It was about  9:45 pm. It all started when I was taking my dog outback to go to the bathroom. When I got outside I felt like I was being watched but ignored the feeling untill the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I became very nervous when my dog stood still, looked away from the house, and growled. We lived on nine acres in a rural mountain setting near a river and at first I thought it might be a cougar or a bear in the dark. Then I shined the flashlight in the direction the dog was staring, and I saw two large hairy animals go over the fence. The larger one was about seven and a half feet tall and was a female.  She just stepped over the five foot tall barbed wire and wood post fence like an athelete.  The smaller animal was about five and a half feet tall and it used a fence post to help it leap over the fence. They both had yellow eyes. Like a cat. Their hair color ranged from a very dark to a  light brown. They both had an ape like head.  Then I ran back inside with my dog and told my mom and dad that I saw two Bigfoots. At first I was really scared. Then my parents went after it,not to hurt it but to see it up close. I wanted to go but they woudn't let me.(BUMMER!) When they got back they told me what they saw and what happend. My dad said when he shone the flashlight on the momma he said she just stood there an stared at him. My mom said once she and dad passed the gate toward the acerage she smelt a wet-dog,musty smell.The wierd thing is that the smaller bigfoot was nowhere in sight..The momma bigfoot must have hidden the younger bigfoot either behind her or by the river.My mom said she kept hearing noises behind her.The next day me,mom,and my dad saw huge tracks in the grass.

06109,1814,7676,1978,Fall,September,CA,Tuolumne County,We were camped at the horse corral near Groundhog Meadow near Herring Creek Reservoir.,Strawberry,Highway 108,"My son and I arrived at the horse corral near Groundhog Meadow late on a Friday night in early September 1978.  We spent all Saturday building two deer blinds with the intent on coming back to the area to hunt later that year.  The area, at that time, didn't receive very much recreational activity, and we saw no one else while we were camping.  Saturday night, three strange incidences occurred.  First, early in the evening, my son and I heard two screams.  The first scream was located near the horse corral.  The scream sounded like it was from something very large.  It was very loud and low-pitched, sort of like a very large angry man.  I have heard mountain lions in the past, since I have hunted all my life, and this was nothing like that.  A few minutes later, we heard another scream, just like the first, but it came from the east, like from the Emigrant Wilderness.  We both acknowledged that we had heard the screams, but neither of us knew what it was.  My son checked the horse corral and didn't see anything.  Later that evening, as we were sitting around the campfire, I noticed a pair of red eyes looking at me from near the horse corral.  The area where the eyes were was in total darkness and I do not know if the firelight could reach that far in order to cause the eyes to reflect red.  At first, I just thought it was a deer or other animal, but then it dawned on me that the eyes were at least six to seven feet off the ground.  Since I knew the area very well, I knew that there were no trees or other objects in that area for something, like an owl, to stand on.  After it watched me for about 30 minutes, I asked my son if he also saw it.  He did.  He and I continued to be watched for another 30 minutes (one hour total).  After I briefly looked away and I turned back, the eyes were gone.  The next morning, both my son and I checked the area and confirmed that no trees or other objects were present for an animal to stand on and appear to be seven feet tall.  The last incident happened the same night when we went to my camper to eat dinner and go to bed.  The camper was on the bed of my utility truck, and was at least five feet off the ground.  As we were making sandwiches, we both heard and felt a loud bang or thud on the side of the camper (on the front driver's side of the camper).  The camper was hit so hard, it shook the whole truck.  We grabbed our flashlights and immediately went outside, expecting to see either a tree limb or a very dazed deer.  We saw nothing.  We even circled the camper and didn't see anything.  We both then realized that whatever had hit the camper had to be at least five feet tall and could not have been a deer running blindly in the dark.  We thought that all the incidences were strange, but nothing else happened that night and we went home the next day.  We returned to the area to hunt later on that year.","Nothing, other than noted.","Yes one, my son.",No.,All the incidences happened on Saturday night.,This was near a meadow in the Stanislaus National Forest.,

This are is","Klamath, California",Blake Rd. ,"It was the last weekend of September during the fall salmon run of fishing season on the lower Klamath River 2001.    It was the end of summer, the river was extremely low and I'd just finished cleaning my salmon. It was about 10 oclock at night and I drove up the river to Blake's river bar.  This is where the road ends. We were sitting in my truck with the windows down when we heard a sound that I'd never heard on the river or anywhere for that matter.  My attention was immediately taken as we could hear an extremely deep howling sound that sounded  something like a whoooooaaahhhh.  I was a little freaked out because I have never heard anything like this.  I remember trying to put a body with the sound and not coming up with anything.  My friend and I looked at eachother and said ""what the hell is that?"" The hair was raised on the back of my neck and I felt very fearful, even though I knew the thing was across the river.    We waited and didn't say anything and within about 3 seconds we heard the same sound again.  This time it went whooooooahhhhh, whoooooahhhhh, whoooooahhhh, three times. It was a very deep almost like a moaning sound.    Immediately after the sound stopped I heard the same noise, except this one sounded like it was coming from up around the corner, about a half mile, and on the other side of what is called Turup flat.  This one sounded more faint because is was coming from on the other side of this densely wooded area where the river bends.    It seemed clear to us that they were calling back and forth to one another.  The one on the top of the river called back only twice and the one across the river sounded off about 4 times.  This entire thing only took about 20 seconds and then it was done.    I couldn't really explain what I was thinking or feeling after they stopped but I was very shaken and just sat there for about thirty seconds waiting to see if there was going to be any more sounds.  I turned my lights on after I thought that it was over and couldn't see anything because the fog was to dense.  We were both sure that we had never heard an animal like this before.  Between the two of us we have about 60 years of night fishing and hunting in this area and this was a first.  We both talked about it and felt that whatever it was that they could have come in from either side of the river because the river was so low that it would have been easy to wade across and there wasn't littel traffic in the area.  The river was also very warm and it was also full of 30-50 pound salmon that were heading up the river. It was a great time to fish if that's what they doing. ",Not that I can recall.  I just know that I've spent the good part of my life gill net fishing at night on this river and I've heard everything from mountain lions to bear and coyotes and this wasn't anyone of those things and even though.  Since this has happened I'm very interested in pursuing this thing and getting more proof if possible.  I still spend allot of time on the river at night in my jet boat when I hunt and fish and I'm hoping to have another encounter.  I also spend allot of time in the surrounding areas fishing and hiking and I hope that something will give me more proof that these things exist.  ,"2,  We were just sitting in the truck for about 2-3 minutes and listening to the river and talking when we first heard it.",There have been at least 5 reports in the klamath area over the last ten years.

It was a relatively warm day, somewhere in the 80s.  It was probably in the low 60s that evening.",Heavily wooded area along the Klamath River.  They both seemed to be hanging along the tree line of the Turup Flat area. I felt that it might have come from across the river on the Starwein flat area because this is closed off and there's no access into this area.

What happened was one early Morning in 72 or 73, I was with my uncle and we were going either deer or bear hunting.  I would say it was about 4-5 in the morning, it was very crisp morning I would but it maybe 35-45 degrees.  We left my uncles ranch [my uncle and I], as we were going down the road about 3 miles from his house, I noticed out of the headlights what appeared to be maybe a cow coming out of an olive orchard.  As we got closer, I noticed that the creature was on all fours, the upper part [thoracic] seemed to arch and it was higher, than the rear part [postural], the fur was dark but seemed to shine with the headlights, the head itself did seem to be round in a way with the exception that the occipital area seemed to be more pointy. The creature crossed the 2 way road, I would say that the length of the body itself was almost 1/2 the length of this 2-way country road. I did notice that it crossed the road in, I would say 3 strides.  When it got to the other side it went down the irrigation ditch 2ft down, at this time it was coming out of the headlights, but the figure seemed to have stood, then take one step over the fence.  So if we figure that it stood on a irrigation ditch 2ft below the road and then took a step over a 4ft fence, what ever it was huge.     There were things that did catch my attention.    1.The fur how it shined, it seemed to sway with the movements of the body.  2. At the level of the shoulders, I would say it was as the same height, as my uncles F-250 4wd, which I will say that the hood stands easily 5ft.  3. As we approached the creature did turn his head to look at us, the face was dark, humanoidish like, it's eyes where planted firmly in front and not to the side, also the creature seem to like growl at us because it did show us his teeth.  4. Now when the creature did turn his head, it seem to do so with some difficulty, as it completed its rotation of the head it seem to make its right shoulder move towards the back and I would attribute this because it had a very short neck.  5. The eyes in the headlights were RED, but yet the teeth did not seem to shine yet you knew they were teeth, also the mouth area seemed to be almost flat like, in other words more human like, and not a snout like a bear or cat would have.  After we passed I do remember my uncle mentioning that there must be a skunk around cause it stank.  Personally, I cannot smell so I cannot account to that.  After it crossed the fence I could not see it any more.  p.s. You could see the movement of the muscles of the upper body.",no,"My uncle, but he does not remember the account [health issues].","Sometimes the old timers that used to live there will say things like missing sheep, but thats about it.",4-5 am  Clear skies.,"We were going north, olive orchard to the west, field to the east, if I remember correctly.",
06071,1825,7759,1963,Summer,August,CA,San Bernardino County,The name of the cabin was called Peyton Place.,Big Bear Lake Resort.,I do not remember the name.,"This is not a sighting, but I strongly believe it would have been. It happened 40 years ago this past summer. The year was 1963. I had to go out to California with my family. I really did not want to go, but I did not have a choice. We went out for the whole summer. My uncle rented a cabin at Big Bear Lake for a week.    On the last night at Big Bear Lake my aunt took my mother, sister and me to the movies in town. The movie was over around 8pm so we then headed back to the cabin.  Once we arrived at the cabin I realized I did not have my wallet. I asked my aunt to drive me back to the movie theater, and she refused to take me.  So I decided to walk to town to see if I could find my wallet. When I arrived at the movie theater, I asked the girl at the ticket booth if I could look for my wallet. She gave me permission to enter the theater to look for it.  To my surprise, I found it stuck in the seat.   When I came back outside it was dark. Something I didn't think of when I left the cabin.  There was only one road back up the mountain, so off I went.  The road went up the side of a mountain, and it was a gravel road. I was walking along and started to hear something moving on my left. It was the sound of branches snapping when you step on them. Remember the road was on the side of a mountain.  The terrain on the right side of the road was a steep hill upward with a lot of thick trees and underbrush. On the left side of the road was a steep angle going down.  It would be very hard for a human to climb without slipping.  There were no trees, but a lot of bushes and underbrush.  That was where the sound was coming from. When I stopped to listen to the sound it stopped too.  So I started to walk again.  The sound of branches snapping did too.    As kids back in Pennsylvania we always carried stones with us just in case we ran into trouble.  I had some nice sized rocks in my pocket.  I started to lob them into the air so they would fall on whatever it was down there. Then the breaking of branches became more vigorous.  When I stopped to listen, the thing kept on coming up the side.  The road went off to the right about 20 yards ahead of me. At the speed this thing was moving, I would not make the bend. Therefore I told myself if a car came around the bend I was going to be a hood ornament. There was no way I was going to let it go by me.   God must have been with me, because a car came around the bend. I stood right in the middle of the road waving my hands up and down like jumping jacks.  My aunt was driving with my mother and sister in the car. I must have scared her, because she slammed on her brakes and stopped with only a foot to spare. I ran to the side of the car and got in. The first thing I said was lets go.   I did not tell anyone about this at the time, because I was too shook up.  My sister knew something was wrong just by the look on my face. I did not tell my sister the story until we got back to good old Pennsylvania. ",My uncle came out to California in 1955.

06105,1828,7773,1980,Fall,September,CA,Trinity County,"Take Interstate-5 to Redding, west to Weaverville, north on Highway 3 to Coffee Creek Road, then west to Big Flat Trailhead.  We then took trail 5041 approximately 12 miles SSE on horseback into the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area.  We went past the Yellow Rose Mine, past Red Rock Mountain, along the ridge until you get to Bear Creek.  From Bear Creek we followed the trail southwest to our camping spot (north/northwest from the trail). ",Weaverville,Coffee Creek Road,"My dad, my cousin, his wife, and myself, along with six others went on a 10-day deer hunt in the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area.  We had contracted with a local outfitter to meet us at the trailhead and to transport us and all our equipment to a campsite selected by the outfitter.  He had been contracted to return to pick us all up later and return us to our trucks at the trailhead.  The outfitter transported all of us and all of our gear to a location approximately 12 miles south of the trailhead.  This was accomplished by using horses and mules.  The ride was approximately 4 hours in duration each direction, although the horses did seem to walk faster as they got closer to their corral at the trailhead.  We had also contracted to rent two horses and one mule to assist in deer hunting and retrieval efforts.  The first night at camp was uneventful.  The second day, another hunter (J.K.) and I decided to spend the night on the ridge across the valley to the east of our camp in order to be in position for a good spot to deer hunt the following morning, which was the first day of deer season (opening day is always on a Saturday).  J.K. and I, along with my dad and J.K.s dad, packed our gear for a small, remote camp across the valley to a spot near the tree line, the ridge, and a natural draw/saddle which crossed over into a valley to the east.  We set-up our small camp and constructed two small deer hunting blinds for use the next day.  Everyone else left by mid-afternoon, leaving just myself, J.K., and Nancy (the mule) on that ridge.  Two events happened that night.  1. Loud Scream  without any prior warning, noises or animal sounds, J.K. and I heard an extremely loud scream.  Only a single vocalization can be recalled.  This scream began high-pitched in nature, resembling a woman screaming.  The beginning of the scream was reminiscent of a woman being murdered from an old Alfred Hitchcock film.  The unexpected scream was explosive and violent in nature.  This first portion lasted approximately 3-4 seconds.  The scream then changed tone to one with a deeper quality to it.  This portion sounded similar to 3 mountain lion cries in rapid succession.  This second portion lasted 2-3 seconds.  Finally, the scream ended with an even deeper tonal quality.  The end of this scream resembled the growl of a bear.  This final sound heard was a very deep growl/rumble, which just trailed off.  This portion lasted 2-3 seconds.  The scream originated from a location approximately 75-100 yards northwest and approximately 50 feet lower in elevation of our position.  It sounded like the sound emanated from the tree line at the far edge of a large, nearby meadow.  Upon very distant investigation with crappy flashlights, we saw nothing.  2.  Injured Mule  Our rented mule, Nancy, was tied to a small pine tree in a small clearing approximately 50 feet from our camp/tent.  Our very small tent was separated from this clearing by a small grove of short to medium sized pine trees, and it was between our tent and the large meadow mentioned earlier.  Our camp was on the edge of a North/South ridge; with the mule being due north of us, and a very steep drop-off only about 100 feet was due east.  The large meadow was actually not a meadow at all; it was a sloping, natural pass with a well-worn hiking trail along the south side.  After the excitement of the scream had worn off, approx. 30-45 minutes later and as we were getting into our tent for the night, the mule suddenly began sounding as if something were scaring the crap out of her.  She was sounding out very loudly and very excitedly.  We could also hear her hoofs pounding the ground.  J.K. and I both scrambled over to her, with guns and flashlights in hand, to find her in a state of great excitement.  This mules ears were laid back; her eyes were wide open and darting about.  Nancys breathing was also very rapid, and her nostrils were flaring.  She was still tied to the tree where we had left her.  Actually, she was as close to the small tree as she could get.  But as we approached her, we noticed she was holding her left front hoof off the ground.  She did not appear as though she wished to put any weight on that leg, but we could find absolutely no sign of trauma to the leg.  And upon further examination, we found no other obvious signs of physical injury to Nancy at all.  She was obviously psychologically traumatized, as she whimpered and shook for quite some time afterwards.  We untied her and moved her to an area next to our tent.  A brief search of the immediate area with crappy flashlights and high-powered weapons yielded nothing productive, other than some possible shadows in the distance.  The ground was very firm and we found no tracks that night or the next day.  The following day, and upon return of my dad and J.K.s dad to our location, we described the events of the previous evening and we all examined the swollen left front knee of Nancy.  Even in the daylight and upon very close examination by everyone, no obvious signs of trauma were noted to Nancys leg.  But it was indeed swollen to approximately twice its normal size and she had difficulty placing her weight on it.  Her knee had begun to subside in swelling somewhat by the time we were due to return to our trucks, and she did carry her appointed rider home as scheduled.  No real explanation was ever agreed upon as to what made the screaming sounds or as to the cause of Nancys injury.  The remainder of the week passed without any similar incidents.","There may be only two more/additional observations of note form this trip into the wilderness.  1.  Our hunting party performed an organized deer drive in an attempt to flush hidden deer from cover and push them into an area which a pre-staged hunter may get a clear shot.  No deer were seen during this effort, nor was any real fresh sign found.  However, I did happen upon an area that was approximately 4 feet by 8 feet that had been cleared of all forest litter, etc.  This area was covered with a thick layer of pine needles, but no sticks or cones, etc. was found in this area.  The area also appeared as if it had been leveled somewhat as the eastern (uphill) portion of the area had a discernable terrace effect, as well as the western (downhill) side had been somewhat raised to make the area more level.  The eastern portion of the area was against a very large pine tree, and the northern and southern ends of the level area extended beyond the tree on either side, with the tree centered on the uphill side.  I noticed this spot from approximately 50 feet away, as the excavated/leveled area stood-out in sharp contrast to its surroundings.  The area did not look natural.  I sat down in this area for a short rest and found no deer sign upon inspection.  I had no knowledge of Bigfoot at this time, and I did not suspect this was anything more than a deer bed, but it was the largest deer bed I had ever seen!  I also laid flat on my back in this area and it was actually quite comfortable, but I noticed the area was very roomy and I did not fill the space completely in either direction.  I also noticed that the view form that location was magnificent.  From that spot you could clearly see our base camp and the trail we used to access the entire area.  2.  Only one deer was killed during that entire hunting trip.  J.K., sometime near the end of our week there, killed a nice buck.  J.K. was hunting over the other side of the ridge to the northwest of our base camp.  J.K. said he came over the top of the ridge to see two bucks standing in the open near the top of the ridge.  J.K. said he shot and killed one deer, but even though the other deer was nearby and had obviously seen the first deer go down, the second deer did not move, but instead looked off to the west (downhill).  Even though J.K. had two tags for deer, he did not wish to stop hunting, so he said he fired a round at the feet of the second buck which caused it to run away.",One hunter was with me (J.K.) and heard the scream and examined the mule with me.  Eight others were in the party as a whole.,,"Friday night, around 9-10 p.m.","We were in the Trinity Alps Wilderness.  The campsite was located on the eastern ridge, past Red Rock Mountain.  The main trial branches at the northern end of the valley and the area of the scream is off the east trail, as the trail nears the ridge, and as it skirts the south side of a very large, grassy natural pass.  Just to the south of this pass, near both the trail and the ridge, is where we camped that night.",

As the bigfoot became almost even with me across canyon, it disappeared into the manzanita, about 80 yards away.  I then heard a jeep on the above dirt road. By the time I looked back to where the bigfoot was, he already had come back out of the brush and was walking uphill. He was about 7' tall and had a slender body like a basketball player with big strong shoulders, and a real skinny waist. The legs were really muscular, and strong.  The arms were long, as were the fingernails, and fingers. He had no clothes on whatsoever, and the bigfoot’s body was covered with about 2"" of hair with a few bald spots showing skin.  Its hair was black, and cut off about even with the upper neck. Its forehead was gunpowder gray with the temple area being purple red down the side of the face partway then dark tan.  The face was flat with a flat nose.  It walked hunched over with his arms at a dead hang as he walked.  After I made this sighting I went back the following weekend to look around some more for what I had seen. I walked up the same trail bigfoot walked up, and found a steer skull laying in the trail.  I picked the skull up and looked at it, and it was completely clean underneath without a cobweb or a speck of dirt. I sat it down exactly how I found.  I went back two weeks later and the skull was gone.  Maybe it was a migration route, and others were following.",none,"None, just myself.",,Occurred at mid morning.

Pass the first set of buildings on your right and find your way through the giant gravel piles to the rivers edge.  Be couteous and ask someone for dirrections please, its a bit of a maze down ther with the large gravel piles and the dense willows.  Once your on the river bar look accross to the south west.  Thats were they were on the far bank behind large woody debris. ",Blue Lake,299,"It was a typical winter afternoon in Humbolt County, it was raining intermitantly and the river was on the rise and becoming too turbid to fish.  But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the ""Where did it occur?"" section of this report.    I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a ""B"" then bellow ""Whoooooooop"", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard.    To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That's not what this was.    Well, I didn't think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn't focus on it at first, I wasn't sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad.    As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn't move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from  the thigh up, it didn't move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn't see its eyes.    These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high.    As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area.    I don't follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I'm not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there.   ",see above,No.,"A few people from the area said they have heard the same sounds, and one guy said he almost hit one with his truck near Titlow Hill, on a gravel road leading to his ranch, but all of these reports were 10 years old or so.","It was between 5 and 6pm, It was raininig off and on, and the river was on the rise from the previous two days of rain.

His mother and I are divorced and where she lives outside of Grass Valley. There are houses out there that are close together but also big areas of wooded lots. He told me that he thought he had seen Bigfoot while walking home from his bus stop.  Normally, my ex-wife picks my son up at the bus stop, but he had asked to walk home this day.  It is about 1/2 mile from the bus stop to his house.  As he was cutting across the woods, about 100 feet from the bus stop and 20 feet off the pavement, he jumped up onto a stump.  Below him he saw a black figure, taller than 5'10"" (my height).  It was about 15 feet from him and breathing very heavily.  It had its arms to its side and was rocking slowly, side to side.  My son was afraid, but didn't want to scream in case the animal reacted badly to the noise.  He just slowly backed up the hill, keeping his eyes on the creature and when he got to the pavement, ran home.  He said the creature turned its head to follow his movements, but otherwise didn't move.  When my son got home, he immediately told his mother and then later, me.

06045,1881,8059,1966,Summer,August,CA,Mendocino County,"On hillside above Albion Flats, on the south side of the Albion River.  Above the river boat dock.","Albion, California",Hwy.1,"My encounter took place in Albion, Mendocino County Calif. in the summer of 1966 when I was 15 years old.  My father was a commercial fisherman, and had his boat docked up the Albion River about 250 or 300 yards at the boat docks.  We lived in Ukiah, and came over to see my Dad to bring supplies to him and visit at least twice a week. Soon after, we put a trailer on the flats near the boat dock, and moved to the coast permanently.  The encounter happened one evening just before dark, as the sun was just going down over the hill. My parents, younger sister, and younger brother were on the boat and getting ready for bed. It was before 8 p.m.  My older sister and myself had to sleep in the car as there wasn't enough bunks on the boat for us to sleep. We had blankets and pillows on the seat to sleep on.  The car was a 1957 two-door Pontiac Chieftain. I had the back seat and she the front. I remember it being too early and light out to want to go to sleep. We sat there and talked as teenagers will do. Across the river was a steep rolling hillside that had sheep grazing on it that belonged to a man named Paul Anderson. We had the windows down as it was summer and very nice out. We were interrupted in our talking by the sounds of sheep crying out in unison and baaing in a way that didn't sound normal for sheep. We both jumped up and looked out the right side windows trying to see what was after the sheep. We could see the sheep running frantically towards the west side of the hillside pasture.  The sheep were scattering in different directions, separating into smaller bunches. To the left  and upper part of the field, we both spotted two very large and hairy animals chasing the sheep.  We thought that they were bears running on their hind legs like trained animals would do. It was very alarming for us to watch as these bears were terrorizing these poor sheep. Our position from the attack was about 150 yards or more. We watched as these big animals chased the sheep for what seemed like hours.  In reality, the whole chase scene was about 20 or 30 minutes. As it got dark, we were sure that the bears would swim the river and come for us next. We locked the doors and hid under the blankets for the rest of night.  It seemed like an eternity til morning came and we could finally get out of the car and go to the boat to see our parents. We told them what had happened, and I know that they thought that we had stayed up all night dreaming up that story. That morning, we were up at the post office near where the attack had occurred, and people were talking about the sheep being killed by a wild pack of dogs that were roaming around. The Sheriff, Sam Costa said that it was unusual for dogs kill and eat only the belly and insides of the sheep. We heard about the wild dogs for years after that, every time livestock were killed and mutilated by a predator. I never forgot what I saw and heard that night, and now know that it wasn't bears or wild dogs.","Several sheep were killed and mutalated due to the attack. Everyone except my sister and myself believed that the predators were wild dogs. We actually believed that they were bears that had mastered how to walk, run, and kill by standing exclusively on their hind legs.",My older sister.  We were in the car talking prior to incident.,"Years later, when I was on my own and living in Fort Bragg further up the coast, I heard of other sightings in our area. My father in law told me a story about seeing one when he was a young man living in Comptche, near Alion.  In the 1930s, he was in a wagon when a bigfoot crossed the road in front of the horses.  The driver said the big hairy thing did it all the time and called it a woodsman.  This was on the road to Willits.  Several other stories include:  In the 1970s two bigfoots were stealing grain sacks near Albion.  In the 1940s north of Fort Bragg near Ward Ave, a bigfoot was seen carrying an armload of fish.

About five minutes after I went outside, I noticed a faint, but still very pungent, odor on the breeze. Kind of a cross between skunk, rotting carcass, & very dirty wet dog.  I've lived in the area all of my life, and hunted around the local hills and gulches, and have not encountered a smell quite like this before or since.  The smell came in on the breeze from the west of the trailer, up the hill from the property.  I am a believer in the Sasquatch, having read, watched, and listened to as much information as I could get my hands on from the time I could read.    About a week after the incident, I was working on a bicycle on the back porch, at about, 10:00 or 10:30 P.M., when I heard a low gutteral growl/hoot type noise, coming from behind me.  I would say from the volume of the noise, the critter that produced it was, maybe no more than 100 to 200 feet away.  That would have put the area it was in about halfway between our trailer, and the neighbor up the road.  Due to spending a considerable amount of time in the woods hunting, and just hiking around, I have encountered or heard just about all of the wildlife in this area, this sounded like nothing I have heard before.  The strange part of the encounter, was the fact that our German Shepherd Rottweiler cross heard nothing, nor did any of the other neighbor's dogs.  I went inside to retrieve my handgun and a flashlight to check around the vicinity, but found nothing out of the ordinary.  However due to the time year the ground was way too dry to accept any tracks.

06089,1898,8184,1984,Summer,August,CA,Shasta County,,Not sure.,Not sure.,"I was on a houseboat vacation with my family at Shasta Lake when I was 13.  We had put our houseboat to shore in a secluded cove that branched off of the main lake.  I went on a walk alone along the shore, and then followed a near-dry creek bed that came down out of the nearby woods to the lake.  I had followed the creek bed for about a mile when I came upon two sets of footprints in the mud along the creek bed.  Both looked human-like, with five-toes.  One set was about a size 14, the other about a size 9, comparing them to my own foot at the time.  They were very wide prints, and appeared neary flat-footed.  I was curious, though I hadn't made the Bigfoot connection yet.  It had seemed odd to me that someone would have been barefoot this far into the woods.  The tracks came out of the nearby woods, down to the creek bed, and they then followed the bed for a while away from the lake and into the deeper wooded region.  After a few hundred yards, they turned up a slight grade and into the woods on the opposite side from which they started.  Another thing that made me suspicious of the prints were that they had crossed the rocky creek bed, which was filled with sharp, shale-like stones.  It seemed to me that it would have been a very painful experience for any human to walk those rocks barefoot.  I noted that the larger prints were set wider apart than the smaller prints.  Still not making a BF connection, I went back to the houseboat and said nothing to my family.  That night my brother and I were in our sleeping bags on top of the houseboat, still parked in the same spot.  We were both drifting off to sleep when we both heard a very loud scream.  It sounded like it was fairly far away.  At first, I thought it had been a woman screaming.  Then I hear the scream again.  It started off sounding like a baby beginning to wail, but then got louder and more high-pitched like a woman's voice in full scream.  It seemed resonant, like it was coming out of a hollow tube.  As it ended, it dropped down into a low gargle-like growl.  Both screams lasted maybe three seconds each.  It was then that I put the footprints and scream together in my head.  Though my brother heard the screams also, we didn't really talk about it.  My brother buried his head in his bag, while I tried to stay awake to listen for more sounds.  After a while I had fallen asleep, and awoke the next morning to find that my family had already moved the houseboat out of the cove as I slept, so I didn't get to go back to investigate the footprints again.  I did not tell my family about my Bigfoot suspicians, but my brother did mention to me later that he heard a ""bear"" walking along the shore that night, near where the houseboat was aground.  He said he heard heavy footsteps, heavy breathing, and some grunting.

My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can't remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey's. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them ""look out, look out,"" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest.

06017,1951,8595,2003,Fall,,CA,El Dorado County,,Pollock Pines,Sly Park road about 3 miles from Highway 50,"I am posting this report after several months of trying to dismiss what I saw as a bear or other common animal. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw could only have been an unknown animal such as Sasquatch, as the behavior and curiosity of the animal does not match any animal I am aware of, yet is consistant with Sasquatch descriptions I have read on this and other web sites.  I had heard recent reports of black bear sightings becoming more common in the Pollock Pines area and that the bears are extending their range from the Rubicon/Desolation Wilderness area south to Pollock Pines. Two black bears had recently been hit and killed on Highway 50 about 3 miles north of my encounter. All this talk of bears in our area is what led me to initially conclude that what I had seen was a bear.  Approximately 5:30am sometime in early fall I was travelling northbound about 45mph on Sly Park road heading toward Highway 50. It was almost completely dark, there was some light starting to become visible, there where no other vehicles. I rounded a sharp corner to the left going downhill when my highbeams hit a large animal on the left side of the road, it was standing on two legs and was facing to the left. It appeared to be grabing at something in the trees in the front yard of a residence. As soon as my light hit the animal it quickly turned 180 degrees to it's right in a twisting motion going down on all fours and proceding to run on all fours to the other side of the road. The right side of the road had thick brush which at that time appeared to be about 3 feet tall. The right side of the road also opens into thick forest land. Upon first seeing the animal I slowed down to about 25mph to be sure this large ""bear"" got across the road without me hitting it. As I drove past the location where the animal had entered the brush I looked out the passenger window and to my surprise I saw it's face in the brush looking right into the window only a few feet away. I saw large reddish brown eyes, a large brown head and a dull black (not shiny) area that would have been the nose. I did not see ears and since it was looking straight on, I was unable to discern a flat or pronounced snout. In retrospect the face appeared to convey an emotional look of concern or panic.  During the encounter I did not consider the animal to be anything other than a bear until several minutes later when I thought it was odd that the animal would cross the road to escape then stop just inside the brush to watch me pass. I would think a Bear would continue to run into the forest. Even with this curious behavior I continued to assume it had been a bear. I was shocked into reconsidering my expanation a few weeks later when road crews cleared the brush away revealing that the brush was growing on a drop off that was 5 feet lower than the road, making the brush 8 feet tall. This would rule out the animal being on all fours while looking into my passenger window. The animal had to have stood up again immidiately after entering the brush to reach the hight required to look into my window, that would place the animal at approximately 8 feet tall. Is it likely that all the behavior I have described can be attributed to a bear, not likely in my opinion.",,No other witness,"I've been camping in the Sierra Nevadas and Desolation Wilderness since childhood. I've heard calls and screams matching sould bites and reports on your site in the same areas I've heard the sounds in the Desolation Wilderness area.   I've read reports on your site that seem to indicate there may be a concentration of these animals in the Desolation Winderness North of Highway 50 between Pollock Pines and Echo Summit. I also read a report on your site that finally convinced me to subit my report.

Back then there was only a golf course separating the rural area from Annadel State Park. The way we climbed took us over a series of smaller hills before we got to the base of the peak. On our descent off the last hill we took a break knowing the large climb ahead of us. Just then we heard the loud snapping and cracking of tree limbs directly across the valley that separated ourselves from Bennett Peak. It was then I spied a huge brown/black hairy back trucking up the peak at a very fast pace. As this creature moved up the hill it basically was clearing all of the foliage, mainly oak tree branches, out of its way. When we reached the spot where we saw this thing, we noticed that the tree branches that were damaged were four to five feet off the ground. Bear?

My wife, kids, and me were all in rear of trailer sleeping, which we had rented for the week. We had opened the windows all around the trailer, because it was hot earlier, but left them open after we fell asleep.    I was in a deep sleep, when literally my wife starts smacking and pulling at my arm, as I'm abruptly awoken, she begins frantically telling me in soft hurried controlled panic there is something outside, I cracked my eyes and was conscious, I heard what she said, but was either not believing what she said, or that she wasn't lying, and something was really outside.  In her words she heard padded steps for a minute, before she woke me up.  Then what got me was when something stepped on our outside trailer step, and put pressure on the step, which caused the trailer to move.  Well, by this time we were both sitting up in our bed, and hanging on every whim, listening in the night.  My wife was so scared; she said, If that door opens I'm going to scream so loud I swear.  At that moment, it was surely a strange eerie feeling, and I remember anticipating the door opening, and how helpless I felt.  I was sweating seriously, because something inside of me was telling me that I did not want to confront what was outside.   Daisy, my beautiful Jack Russell dog we brought along who barks at everything, and is always alert, was in the front part of the trailer sleeping on the couch.  It was quiet the whole time not making a peep, and when we looked at her, she was like right, no way am I going out there!  In the morning we asked our friends if they heard anything, or were you playing around at night?  But, with paying it no mind they said ""no!""  But, I knew it was not in their character.

I walk out to our porch and wait for about 5 min. It is pretty cold out side so I'm about to go in side when I heard something that made my skin crawl, and my hair stand on end. The sound was very gutteral in nature, It sounded like chirpping and then it went into a scream that sounded like a cougar,bear,howler monkey rolled into one. It is really hard to explain the sound. I have heard it before on bigfoot documentaries since then. I went out to search for what made the noise and didn't see anything but there was a punget odor in the air.  At the time I did not associate the two. I went back inside. The next morning our next door neighbor complained that someone was outside her window last night. She said her window shades were drawn but could see the silhouette of a head and shoulders. I asked her to show me what window it was. It was her back bedroom window that is at least 6-7 ft off the ground.

06019,1991,8868,1998,Summer,July,CA,Fresno County,Kaiser Pass Road forks just above Mono Hot Springs.  One side heads toward Edison Lake the other towards Florence lake.  We were camping right along the road to Florence on a ridge just before the road drops down toward the lake.  Maybe 2 - 3 miles from the lake itself. ,"Huntington Lake, Ca.",Kaiser Pass road,"My friend Greg and I had been fishing the San Juaquin river just below Florence Lake until about 6:30 or 7:00 pm.  As we live in Clovis Ca. appoximately 70 miles away, we had decided we would just camp up there for the night.  Kaiser Pass road is a narrow one lane road that traverses some very rugged area.  It takes almost 2 hours to travel the 20 miles back to state highway 168 at Huntington Lake.  So it is about a three and a half hour trip home.  A trip that niether of us wanted to drive after a long day fishing, especially at night.  As the area we were fishing in is notoriously bad for bears, we decided to drive to a camp spot that we were both familiar with just back up the way From Florence Lake.  The camp spot is not in a campground, and is just a single spot off to the side of the road.  But it is a well used spot by many people.  We set up camp, had dinner, and had just sat down next to the campfire.  The light of day was almost totally gone.  We were sitting across from one another as we had both been taught to do when in the wilderness, so you can see if any animals are coming up from behind the other person. Gregs back was to the car and the road.  My back was to a low rising granite out cropping, almost a dome like shaped out cropping that is flat on top.  about 50 yards beyond that is a rather steep dirt ledge that goes up maybe another 25 feet above where we were sitting.  I heard a noise that sounded like a horn on a train passing somewhere in the distance.  I even said to Greg, do you here that train in the distance.  he said yes , he heard it.  We continued to hear it for a while, when suddenly it dawned on both of us that we were at 9000 feet in elevation, and there are no trains for about 70 miles.  Now we were curious about the sound.  And that is how I would best describe it, as the horn on a train in the distance.  It was not an owl, I have heard many owls.  As we continued to listen, it became closer, and became clear that it was over or on the ledge behind me.  I moved to the car, and grabbed a 12 guage shotgun.  The last time we heard it, it was extremely close to us, but still had that low mono toned almost horn like sound.  Not knowing what we were dealing with, and not wanting to shoot someone or something, we called out a warning that we had a gun, just incase it was someone playing a prank.  We did not hear the sound again.  However, as we were both looking out toward the granite out cropping, and the ledge where the sound was coming from, we both turned and looked at each other at the very same time to ask if the other had just seen the same thing.  We had, a pair of eyes glowing in the distance.  Almost like cat eyes, but not yellow like cat eyes, they were more silver, or white.  We only saw them for a second.  Still not wanting to shoot at what I couldn't see, I fired a warning shot in the air.  I didn't here or see anything after that, however, Greg insists he saw the eyes again, even after I fired the shot. Not wanting to find out what isn't afraid of a twelve guage, Greg  threw all of our camping gear in the car as fast as he could while I stood guard with the gun.   We dumped our entire jug of water on the fire, got in the car and drove all the way home.  Niether of us said a word until we got back to town.  I have been all over the mountains up in that area, and have been camping and four wheeling into the back country since I was a kid.  That part of the Sierras is like my backyard to me, and I had never experienced anything like that.  Bears, mountain lions, the rare badger sighting, but nothing like that.    ","We observed nothing after the incident, as niether of us has camped there since.",only two winesses. My friend Greg and I.  we were sitting by a campfire. ,"I heard one story second hand.  My aunt used to work for a dentist who would go deer hunting in the area.  Supposedly, they were camped just beyond where we were at a place called Jackass Meadow.  They had trailerd thier horses in, and had the horses out of the trailer for the night.  They were to pack in to the back country the next day.  Just as the sun was about to set, the horses, which aparently were tied up, became spooked.  When the men looked around to see what was spooking them they noticed a tall figure, some distance away, standing next to a tree.  The men were apparently also scared enough to leave, and camp elsewhere for the night. When they returned the next day, they went over to a tree that the figure had been standing by.  They judged the height of the figure to be over seven feet tall by the bottom branch on the tree that had been just over the figures head.  I didn't really take the story to seriosly at the time.  I had heard it many years before my experience.

When we got there we heard faint sounds like there were two, what we thought at the time, mountain lions calling each other off in the distant. My friend fished while I explored and his girlfriend swam. When all the other anglers that we fishing too me and my friend started making very loud sounds just to hear the echos off the surrounding canyons of Lake Oroville. Then I remembered hearing on one of the sound recordings off of this website and how there was sort of a whistle at the end of the recording from bigfoot so I started trying to imitate the whistle. Well after about five minutes I heard something ""running"" through the treeline of thick bushes above the lake line. It was coming towards us. I asked if anyone heard that and the said no. Right after I said that we heard the same sound earlier but within I'd say 200 ft from us at the bush line. We jumped in the car and turned around so we could make an escape in case anything attacked. My friend shined his light along the treeline and seen some eyes low at the tree line. So I stared whistling like I did before and it would make its sound softly. Well after three times I started mocking it and to our surprise and what made us leave was it whistled back to us. We took off. I tried finding sounds of mountain lions off of the internet that sounded the same but to no avail. Then I listened to monkey and bigfoot sounds and the only thing that came close was a Black Howler monkey. It had almost the same cooing sound. I don't know if it was a mountain lion that could whistle but I believe bigfoot is around and I will continue hunting on around Oroville CA for signs or answers.",It seemed like it was communicating with me.,"3.

Near dusk we set out a picnic next to a creek.  About 15 minutes after sunset a long howl came up the canyon from downstream.  It was loud enough to hear over the noise of the creek five feet away.  In between the howls there was deep toned ""jibberish-barking"" noise, almost like two deep voiced men talking at the same time.  It did not sound like humans, but we couldn't rule it out, until another howl answered from up on the ridge behind us.  Howls were exchanged from the creek valley to the ridge us and we were in between!  This ruled out humans making odd howls and ""jibberish"".  The next thing we noticed is the cows that were grazing downstream all started heading upstream, away from the howl.  We could monitor their movements from their cow bells.  We decided to pack up and high-tail it out of there, leaving right at dark.  Our departure route followed the creek downstream towards the source of the first howl.  As we neared where the howl came from, a buck bolted across the logging road in front of us, fleeing the creek bottom where the howl came from.  It was bolting up the hill before it noticed our vehicle.  There are a few undeveloped creek access areas along the road and we looked at each one as we drove out, confirming no one was in there.  A week earlier (last weekend), as we were leaving the area during a previous trip, my wife stopped her 4x4 because someone/something whistled from the woods.  The whistle was loud and nothing like any birds she'd ever heard.  The kids heard it, too.  (I was following her in a Jeep).  Upon arriving home we listened to our ""Sierra Recordings"" CD's and the audio files on the BFRO site.  The howls were just like the Ohio recording and the distant ""ridgetop"" howls on the Sierra Recordings CD, and the whistling was just like the whistling on the Sierra Recording's CD.  i also noticed lots of (dozens) broken trees and photographed some a few weeks ago.  I'm undecided as to the cause of their breakage.  This area is very easily accessible, with logging roads through-out and only about 25-30 minutes out of West Point, CA.  Parts of the area are currently being logged, with miles of fresh, very fine dust perfect for finding prints.

I lived at the house by the levee in my childhood years 1965-1968. Immigrants had a shack against the levee and always had a gather for the weekend. One day my Mom was out to show the Men how she could shoot her New 22 Ruger rifle at the tin cans. After all the fun, a man was just having an idea if he could just use the rifle on Saturday morning for cottontails, Dad and Mom was happy to let him use it !  Saturday came around and I noticed the home made rack with  cottontail and Jack Rabbit hanging upside down near the small cabins to the side of them. My brother told me to go with him and check them out! it was sad to see such a kill. That evening the men showed my Dad how beer batter makes a good rabbit roast over the fire, and we all had a share of the food with wild rice and flour tortillas.   This went on for two weeks, then a problem occurred! Someone was stealing the rabbits from the rack ! Since our family was the only one in the camp, we where most likely the blame. My Dad was beat-up at a card game as beer caused a climax over the rabbit issue, and I could not stand to see it. I was not afraid of anything cause I never watched any TV in my life about scary stuff, so I had no feeling for that in that direction. I went up the levee to just to look around and I saw a rat-snake. I ran down and told Mom about the snake, Mom said not to go back up again. it could bite me!. but my curious mind took me back up the next day.  I walked up the levee looking down to the right side where I may have seen it last. When I got to the top , that was it... No snake. Then in the silence of everything but the soft breeze blowing a bit in my ear, I saw something moving in front of me. this huge Monkey like creature on a cottonwood tree, looking over the levee. I noticed it in the shade of the upper branches because one of its legs was swinging back and forth below the branch. I got closer to adjust my focus on this big creature and sure enough it was some sort of ape like thing but with a smaller head and it had human like features. I looked down to see if there was a fence between us, and there was not any fence at all ! My mouth was watering over fear and I could not move my legs. I found a way to turn around and get off the levee! As I went down the levee, half way down I started to run and never looked back. I told my Mom about what I saw and she stopped cleaning and told me to just shut and lock the doors. My Mom was now thinking of the rabbits that had gone missing and told me food left-out makes animals gather for more.   We never went over that levee again . Fear after that was something to remember when alone at that age. We moved almost a few years later due to the Juan Corona murders on the same farm, and never spoke about the huge monkey by the levee again.",Rabbits and hunting game that was left to cure missing from the immigrants game rack.,"just myself, I could not belive the feeling of how lonely I felt at that time, with goosebumps all over.","No, its the only time I ever  had such encounter.",nice warm morning,over the levee was cottonwood trees higher than the levee and its just a jungle.,

I stopped and was motionless for a couple of minutes when I heard a loud expulsion of air and a branch snapped behind me in the thick pine trees I had never heard anything like that before so I froze and did not move, and about one minute later I heard the same sound from a little farther away and then the next time I heard it, it was closer and to the north, this happened about six times each time it was in a different location like it was trying to see what I was and scare me off. The last time I heard it sounded like it was right behind me and I flinched then it must have seen me I heard it running away from me through the trees making the same noise and breaking limbs as it was running off. I stood in the same spot for about five minutes and did not hear it again. I walked out of the woods to my truck where my dad was waiting for me and we drove about a mile down the road to a campsite to eat lunch.   At lunch I told my dad what happened and described the noise and he thought it might have been a buck grunting it sounded good to me since I never heard a buck grunt. So we decided that the buck might come back to that spot. So we ate lunch and drove back to the same spot. We hiked in and at the marshy part I told him to go in the direction that the deer ran to and I would try to spook them out again I waited for him to get out of site then I walked toward the pine trees, I got to the pines trees when I seen three does running in my direction toward the grove of trees in front of me, just before they got to the trees I heard the same noise again the expulsion of air and a branch break it spooked the deer two of them ran downhill and the last one ran uphill right at me it stopped within ten feet of me but it never seen me it was so frazzled by what it saw it stopped slowly turned around and tried to see around the tree to what had spooked it. It stood there for about one minute oblivious to me it then slowly turned around and started walking right at me it got within five feet of me then I flinched my arm so it would see me before it walked into me, it startled it so bad the deer fell down on its side did a spin on the ground and jumped up and ran the other way when it got around the tree and down about twenty yards I heard that noise again. The deer ran down and to the south and I seen it stop about 150 yards away through a clearing it would look at me then it would look at where the noise came from, it looked back and forth several times then it slowly walked away.   I then followed where the deer had ran to see what was making that noise I walked very slowly came around the tree and about thirty yards down the tree line I saw a large figure with black hair sitting under a large pine tree sunning, it had large shoulders four to six inch hair but you could still see the muscular definition of its chest and shoulders there was a fallen tree blocking my view below its waistline. But we locked eyes and stared at each other motionless, it had dark eyes I could not see any white, I could see the hair on its head blowing slightly in the breeze, I didnt see any facial hair just a very dark skin face like an ape, after looking at each other for about a minute I wanted to get closer but the fallen tree was in my way so I took a step to my left to go around and when I got out of its site I heard it get up and bound through the trees making the same noise as it ran away from me the loud expulsion of air and breaking branches as it ran off.","I went back to the same general area one year later with my two kids and found about four large footprints in the dirt, you could make out the ridges of fingerprints.

Take the Oro-Dam Blvd. exit East through Oroville and follow the signs to Lake Oroville.",Oroville,Oro-Dam Blvd.,"In the early morning hours of Tuesday, September 21, 2004, I drove towards Lake Oroville (approx. 25 miles from my house) to see if I could get any photographs of the lights of the Valley before sunrise. As I drove, I stopped a couple of times to take photos. It was extremely dark at the time, since the sun was not yet up and the area is against the mountain side to the North and North East sides. I turned my truck around stopped with my truck pointing toward the South West looking out over the Valley. My passenger side window was rolled all the way up but the driver side window was down. I had only been sitting there a couple of minutes when I heard a loud, very angry sounding ""roar"" coming very rapidly toward the back of my truck on the passenger side. I was quite startled (to say the least.. I think I might have screamed) and immediately looked back toward the direction of the sound but could not see anything but blackness. I then threw my truck into gear and took off rolling up my window as quickly as possible. It has been less then 48 hours since the incident happened and I am still very upset and more then a little traumatized. What frightened me the most was that the sound came from above the height of the cab of my truck and nowhere near the ground. It began behind me near the far edge of the road and lasted about three to four seconds then ended abruptly right at the back of my truck near the tail light on the passenger side. I could tell that whatever was making the sound was approaching very quickly. The sound was quite loud and very angry sounding and can only be described as a cross between a lion's roar and the sound a tire makes spinning in deep gravel. I have never heard anything that sounded like it before in my life. I do not know whether it was a bigfoot or not, but if it was a bear it had to be standing upright and at least 7 feet tall. I have since found out that the only bears in that area are small black bears that are not aggressive. I am a 44 year old mother of four and Grandmother of two. I will glady agree to take a polygraph test to confirm what happend to me.

While sitting there in the dark, I continually had the feeling that I was being watched. I have had this same feeling 2 other times, and in both situations I spotted a Mountain Lion watching me from a distance.   As gray light came, I started glassing the steep dense mountain behind me, looking for whatever it was that was watching me. I really could not see very much as it was still fairly dark and the brush was so thick. I cannot remember how long it was that I was glassing the area when a very loud, booming scream echos from the mountain behind me several hundred yards up. It sounded almost like a terrified woman screaming as loud as she could.   At first, I thought that someone was playing a hoax on me.

Travel about 20 miles up Forest Service Road 13N01 to Onion Lake.",Weitchpec,Forest Service Road 13N01,"  On July 5, 2004, my brother and I went on a sasquatch expedition to the Bluff Creek area of Humboldt County California. The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,""WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT""? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would've left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did'nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,""thats what we heared at Onion Lake"". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I'm not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.","The deer that ran down the hill into our campsite along with a few other deer stayed right next to our campsite, about 25-40 feet away from our tent all night as these grunts went on out in the woods. The deer showed no fear of our presence. The acted like they were more comfortable around us, humans, than out there in the woods with what ever it was grunting.",Two witnesses total. My brother and I. My Brother and I had just ate dinner and we were watching a few deer that were grazeing around Onion Lake and our campsite just before we heared the first grunt at about 9 p.m.,"I saw a few other reports on other Bigfoot websites around Weitchpec and at Aikens Creek Campground located at the intersection of Highway 96 and Forest Service Road 13N01 of other people hearing loud grunting sounds that sounds like something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. One report said after the grunt, they heared what sounded like something flapping its lips together.","The grunts started at around 9 p.m and stoped at around 5 a.m. It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky.

I have seen many things in my time that were hard to explain but were not as vivid as the following.  I was driving on Rte 80 e/b in California at 14:30 hrs. on 08/16/04 and I had just passed the truck inspection station and State Work yard which was west of the Donner Pass. As I was crossing over a bridge which crossed over a ravine with a river through it I looked down into the ravine and saw what looked like (about 7 to 8 foot tall) broad shouldered possibly male, all black from head to toe form stepping from the tree line on the west bank approx. 300 to 400 yards south of the bridge. I immediately pulled over to the side of the roadway on the bridge and slowed so that I could see it better (traffic was extremely light -two other cars.) When I looked down I was able to see that the form had no identifiable clothing or demarcation lines or hat. It then was walking in a lanky movement with arms swinging as it crossed the stream/river. I then noticed a slightly smaller (6-7 foot tall)(pos male due to no obvious breasts or femine movements) come out from the tree line behind the other male trailing him by about 30 feet and slightly south by about ten feet. They both continued across the stream and into the tree line on the east side and disappeared. I sat there trying to evaluate what I had seen. I then concluded that these forms were not any animals I've ever seen. They were one solid color from head to toe with no discernable clothing. They had nothing in their hands or on their feet. I could not come up with any possible concept as too why these individuals would be out there. The temperature was extremely warm so the clothing if it was clothing was way too much. Their faces and hands were the same color as the body. I then proceeded e/b with no further sighting.","The only things I found unusual was that there were no close towns only the truck inspection station and they had no packs, or any identifiable items of clothing on them and they seemed to walk out of the woods across the river without looking up to the roadway or left or right as they ventured into the river and across. They seemed unconcerned. They didnt talk or turn towards each other just walked out of the tree line and straight across and into the woods.

Our property is adjacent to and North of Pine Mountain.","Middletown, CA",Dry Creek Road,"I was hunting with my close friend Chris R. in Sonoma County, CA on our family property that is adjacent to Pine Mountain.  We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub.    It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless.    We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again.  I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again.    The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while.  We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush.  Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us.    Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart.  The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris'.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts.  We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.  Like something was timing it's footfalls so as to not be detected.  I have to admit, I felt this way too, even more so after the discussion about the boulder.  ","Last year, 2003, I had gotten a buck in the late evening, and by the time we had it skinned out and bagged, we heard a very strange ""apelike"" scream to the south of our camp.

It had been dead for some time now, because it was mostly just bones.  When I looked a round, still on my horse. That's when I saw Bigfoot. He was really tall, black and so human like. He looked at me, but was not scared. I said to myself that's bigfoot. Bigfoot had one hand and arm leaning against a giant tree, and he looked to be both man and ape. Bigfoot looked right at me, and we both just looked at each other. I was so scared I turned around and went back to the ranch.   I've block this out of my mind for many years, I believe from being scared to death. I spoke to my Dad about the ranch, do we still own 10,000 acres and the ranch. He said no, and is now 90 years old. I asked him did anybody ever say they saw bigfoot. He said yes.  I could take you to the spot where I saw him, and I'm sure someone who lives in that area, would say they have seen him also, why, because he is there.

The cabin was a couple hundred yards off of the dirt road.",Big Bear city,N/A,"I was living in Southern California at the time, I was 12yrs old, and was invited by my friends family to stay at a cabin with them at Big Bear lake for the weekend. We arrived before noon that Friday unloaded the suburban, and helped my friends dad take down the plywood from the windows before heading off to explore the woods and rock formations around the cabin.  After dinner we were discussing the next days activities and went to bed.   The cabin look like in had been there awhile. Sometime during the night I had to go to the bathroom, and I knew the toilet wasnt working.  I got up walked thru the kitchen and turned on the light before going outside.  I left the door open so the light would shine thru, and I closed the screen door behind me.  I didnt want to go right there by the door so I walk over to the tree line on the other side of the parking area, and was reaching down to start when I felt really scared.    I looked over to my right and about 20ft away something was looking at me over a bush. It was between 2 large trees and standing behind a bush parting the top of the bush with its hands looking right at me. All I could see was the upper chest, head, arms, hands. I stood there looking back for 15-20 seconds, and then I just bolted for the cabin.  I didnt look back, because I didnt want to.  I ran up the steps and dove thru the screen door landing on the living room floor; I then reached back and slammed the door.  I crawled to the other side of the room next to the couch before my friends father came into the room. He walked over to me and asked what was wrong, I looked up at him, and I just lost it!! I was crying and shaking so much I couldnt speak.  By that time my friend and his mother were there, and she helped calm me down bit.    I told them I went outside to go to the bathroom, and something was standing there looking at me, They ask me was it a person, I said no!  It was huge, black and very tall.  His father asked was it a bear, I said no!  Bears don't have hands!  My friends father went and got his flashlight, he then walked over to the door and opened it.  He looked at the screen door and looked back at me, what happened to the screen!  I said I left the door open for some light and jumped thru it when I ran back into the cabin. He looked back at the screen door for a second and then shut the door.   My friends mother said no one goes outside until morning when it is light out.  We stayed up for awhile maybe an hour or so, before going back to bed. In the morning I showed my friends father where I was standing and the spot were it was standing he look at the ground a little and the area nearby, but found nothing.  He just said it was probably a bear.  I told him it was not a bear its face was flat and the hands had long fingers. He said we should stay close to the cabin the rest of the weekend and not to go wondering around.   Nothing else happened the rest of the weekend. The description of the face was very ape-like, and the nose area was different not as pronounced just smaller, with hair all over except the mouth area and eyes.  I didnt see any eye shine at all, and the head was pointed. The upper chest was massive, very wide and powerful looking. I notice the hands first when I looked over at it that night.  The hands were long with some hair not as much as the rest of it.  I did see a thumb on the left hand when it was parting the top of the bush.  The bush was taller than me at the time I was 5'7.  I didnt smell or hear anything.   When we got back home my parents were told what happen, and that I was pretty shook up about it, and that I didn't sleep much over the weekend.  I didnt know what I saw until later when I was in our local Woolworth's looking at state boards, and as I past the magazine racks, there on the cover was a picture of Bigfoot from the Patterson film.

The sites we were seeking were few and far between as the area had no significant snowfall in over 3 weeks.  We were above the 7,000 altitude marker along Hwy 4 and it was a mild, sunny day.  The ground was covered in snow. We had exited Hwy. 4 at the snow-play area west of Bear Valley and proceeded along the road to Spicer Reservoir despite patches of shallow snow still in the road.  We were driving slowly along the road and, approximately 1 mile from Hwy 4, we noticed deep impressions in the snow along the right hand shoulder.  We stopped to examine these prints, although I am hesitant to use this term as no details - like toes - were present.  These had obviously been here quite some time and had melted and frozen several times. They were large and deep, measuring 16"" long.  What impressed me the most was that these prints were in a straight line. I recalled this was an attribute of bigfoot track trails, having read this in Dr. John Bindernagels book and in other texts.  I retrieved my tape measure and discovered the distance of the step (that is, the distance between one impression to the next) was 60 in the first measurement and no less than 56 in the others.

06023,2183,10265,2003,Spring,April,CA,Humboldt County,"Well not knowing the area that well, the only way I can remember the area is if I saw it again, sorry.","South of Redcrest, Ca.","Avenue of the Giants, Highway 254","Well it has been a couple of years since it happened, but here goes.  I was stationed at Beale AFB, Ca., and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool.    So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees, so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish, so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.  As I kept driving the river kind of started getting a little farther away, and I was about to turn around.   When out of no where something walked across the road, and to say the least it shocked the you know what out of me.  The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I'm a pretty big guy 6' and about 220 Lbs., but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall, due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71).   Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didnt really have one.  The animals traps made it look like it didnt have a neck.  Kind of like me.    But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.  I only found a couple of tracks. They had to have been 14 to 15 inches long, plus the stride of this thing was a lot longer then mine. Just to make the stride this thing did, I had to make one heck of an effort.  Now all I can say is what ever I saw that day was nothing like anything I had ever seen in the woods, and I grew up in the outdoors. ",No,No,"I had another event and this one was a lot different, but still happened with me fishing. And this one kind of shook me up.","It was mid afternoon and very cloudy that day, with off and on rain.",The area was pretty thick with redwoods and undergrowth and the river was to my right.,
06045,2188,10279,2005,Winter,January,CA,Mendocino County,,Redwood Valley,Hwy 101,"Last night, Jan.16,2005, I took my dog outside for a little walk. We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that's covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual ""animal"" sound unlike any I've heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I'm not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he's inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, ""Anyway, it's on the other side of that hill."" I said, ""It's not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.""  He agreed it was strange but wasn't concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn't hear it again. This is not the first time we've heard  unusual sounds that we can't identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can't connect with any animal I'm familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating ""Big Foot"" sounds that they'd heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he'd been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making. Anyway, here's a synopsis of a few incidents. We decided to post these after last nights occurrence of the strange, unidentifiable call.",,"My self and husband for last nights event. Previous events included my two sons, and my teenage daughter. One of my son's friends,age 19, was here for the water pipe breaking incident.",Cited in same previous description of last nights event,"Nighttime, about 6:00. Cold, mod. overcast with the moon shining through the clouds. Not raining.","Pine,cedar, oak,madrone, manzanita and few redwood tree covered hillsides.

At about 10:00 P.M. we were in our sleeping bags in the tents talking when all the animal sounds going on around us suddenly went quiet. Then we heard a loud , low scream that gradually ended in a high pitch. All of us sat up and were asking the usual question ,"" what was that ?"", then as we waited in our tents we heard other campers from around the lake talking and walking our way when we looked out of the tents we saw that they had all there stuff with them and were leaving in a hurry. We asked them what that noise was and they asked us if we had seen the thing run by our campsite ....we were too scared to notice I guess...We watched your special on cable this morning and when they played the vocalizations of what is beleived to be a Bigfoot  I got scared all over again this many years later.

06109,2276,10980,2003,Winter,December,CA,Tuolumne County,I've only been there twice and there are so many streets to turn too that I still have no idea how to get to the cabin.  All I know is how to get to Twain Hearts.  ,Twain Harte,Highway 108,"Christmas Eve 2003, my wife and I spent XMas in Twain Harte, CA with friends.  This area is deep in the Sierra Mountains and has plenty of snow during the winter months.    We stayed at our friends cabin, which sleeps twelve people with no problem. The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it.  There was plenty of snow and we were warned about walking on the porch. To get to the porch we had to go through the house.  The cabin was warm with the great wooden heater even though the windows had no coverings.    Christmas Eve was upon us and the traditional events came and went.  After midnight, everyone eventually went to bed and retired for the night.  I was sleeping in a room by the porch and the windows like I said before, had no curtains or shades.  I could see very little from all the windows except for one, which was near the outside porch light.  I could see a small portion of the porch from that window.    I went to sleep as did everyone else, but was awakened several hours later.  There was a slight movement all around the cabin like a small earthquake.  I turned over thinking just that.  Moments later, I felt movement again but this time it felt like someone was walking on the porch.  I sat up to look around and did not see anything or anyone.    I decided to use the restroom since I was awake and eventually found my way back to bed.  It was then that I noticed something moving by the porch light. At first, I thought it was a man with long brown hair, but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back.  After a better look, it had hair all over its body, but it seemed more of an orange-brown color.  Frightened as can be, I just kept looking at this thing.  It had its back towards me for several minutes and then slowly turned to look in my direction.  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me.  It leaned over to see through the window.     I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall.  Its weight was about three hundred pounds and well proportioned.  I compared  compared the beast to a friend who is six foot two inches tall and weights three hundred pounds.  It looked fairly young like a teenage boy.  There was also no odor as this thing walked around.  The face was more like a caveman but very sad looking.  I could barely see its eyes in the dark, but I noticed them when it looked left and right. They seemed to be dark brown.    The beast was frightening when it turned and looked in towards the window.  Its chest was like that of a male and I am assuming that it was not quite a grownup yet.  It was searching for something but I dont know what.  I also noticed that our friends dogs were no where to be heard or found in the cabin.  After a quick scan of the room, it turned and headed towards the porch rail.  Eventually, it jumped from the porch, which was a six to eight foot drop.  In the morning, I did not mention this event to anyone nor did I go looking for evidence.     I believe there are different species scattered around the world.  I always believe they existed but my thoughts were reinforced with this citing.  This is also the first time anyone has heard or read this story from me.

No one else was up walking around or said anything.,None.,Explained on writing.,Pine forrest all around and a lake about half a mile away.  Several cabins nearby.,24
06087,2288,11162,1998-2004,Spring,,CA,Santa Cruz County,,Aptos,Eureka Canyon,"We have had various incidents over the past few years since 1998-2004 including 3 sightings, one amazing vocalization occasion, wood knocking, and one footprint.  First I must say that I don't think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it's (plural) normal range or migration route.   The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn't really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I'm a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn't sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, ""I just saw a bigfoot!""  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn't until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,"" oh yeah, that makes sense now...""  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now.   2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I've lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn't have dragged me outside at this point!  I'm 6'3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled...   Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn't have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it's knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it's arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn't realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes... So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.  There are 60-70,000 acres near by and I believe we are in a corner of their range that they visit every once in awhile since the occurances are not everyday.

06107,2305,11407,1985,Fall,October,CA,Tulare County,"Above Kernville, CA  Highway 190 north area--  Peppermint Springs Campground was within several miles of our wilderness camp.","Kernville, Ca.",Kernville/Johnsonville road,"Sir, A good friend of mine and I were camping up on the Kern Plateau, a massive area 7,000 feet-plus in elevation on the western flank of the Sierra Nevada above the Kern River in late October 1985, (Peppermint Springs Campground is closest location). We had driven by 4X4 truck for approx. 2 miles back in from the highway. We wanted to be alone, away from a formal camping area as we had firearms and planned on doing some ""plinking"".                                                                                           However, we discovered that there were                other ""campers/hunters"" in the area-- but none camped close. One gentleman even joined us for dinner, as he hadn't eaten in a couple of days. He was friendly and said he worked as a handyman in the area during the summer season. As night fell, we heard several vehicles pulling out, going back toward the highway. The temperature began to drop rapidly.  Later that evening, perhaps around 8:30 pm, my friend and I were sitting by the campfire sipping beers and listening to a bit of country/western music when suddenly... my friend said to me, ""Do you hear that?"" I turned down the music to listen. What we heard was un-godly. It was a loud, shrill-pitched scream. A combination growl/scream, really, that echoed for miles throughout the woods, and it wasn't human. At first, I thought it must be some drunken hunter howling at the moon. But, it was far too loud and intense. We listened again.... and again it sounded, this time closer. It was quite simply bone chilling.   We immediately turned off the music and grabbed our firearms, rechecked that they were loaded and, frankly, just sat there stunned. We were armed with a 30.06 rifle, a 12-gauge pump shotgun, and a pair of .22 caliber pistols. This did not make us feel secure. It was that profound of an experience, the kind of episode where the hair on the back of one's neck stands straight up.   The entire forest, I mean everything, shut down completely when this creature made those horrific screams. It remained for the rest of the evening. We also felt like something was ""close"" to us. There was just this subtle, palpable vibe. To put in perspective how spooked we were (because we heard another short series of screams around 11:00 pm) we both slept with the guns literally under our pillows. My buddy refused to sleep by the fire, instead preferring to sleep in the back of my Ford pick-up.  I am an experienced bow-hunter/outdoorsman with many years spent in the wilderness hunting and camping. This is the first time I've ever related this story in print, although I have told it several times to friends. At first, they laugh, but as I go into detail they can see quite clearly that I'm not exaggerating. This was a very strange incident, indeed. ","The thing that struck me was how the entire forest seemed to shut down when this creature screamed.  I mean, everything.  Nothing was stirring.  Dead calm, yet in a very eerie sense.",Only my friend and myself.,"I know for a fact that there is a fair amount of bear/mountain lion activity in the area.

The only thing that comes close, is the howl of the GREAT APES I've seen on a National Geographic Special shot in the mountains of Rwanda or something","Evening.

","I have seen Bigfoot two times. The first time was one summer in the late 1970s. My friend and I were camping in the Tahoe National Forest in California. We were camping out of a station wagon, as we did not have a tent. My friend was cooking on the Hibachi, and I was sitting on the tailgate of the station wagon watching him. We were in a newly planted area of seedling pines. The surrounding that area was old growth pine trees. I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot. He was about 5' tall, and hairy all over. His eyes were large as if he were use to living in darker environment. I told my friend to turn around slowly, and look, as he did the Bigfoot melted out of sight back into the forest.   After we had gone to bed for the night around 2:00 AM in the morning, something hit the station wagon so hard that it rocked back and forth. Scared me half silly. The windows were clouded inside with moisture, and the night was dark.   The next time I saw Bigfoot, I was at Lake Shasta in the late 1990s. Wayne, Ginger the dog, and I were bass fishing on the lake, and the weather was warm. On the shore was Bigfoot walking down towards the water. When he got there he swooped his left arm down into the water as if he were checking a trap to see if there were any fish in it. He stood up and walked up the steep hill without any effort.  He was huge.  From the boat he appeared to be at least 7 to 8 feet tall. He had long shaggy hair, very dark brown. While all of this is going on Ginger the dog was going berserk. She was running around the boat yelping and howling. I told Wayne there is Bigfoot. He did not see him. The place where we had launched the boat was in the Jones Valley Resort area.  When I tell people I have seen Bigfoot, and they think I am crazy. I'm not. Cousin Bob went out fishing with Wayne not too long after that. He said he saw something also. He said he didn't know if it was a turkey hunter in disguise or what, but it walked up the steep hill with no effort.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn't to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it's whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn't more then 5 1/2 feet deep. Their was a sand bar and the boulders were at least 30 to 40 lbs.

I have lived in that area for roughly 40 years.  I have smelt some awful smells up there in the woods.  This day my husband and I rode down this one road and found out it didn't go anywhere, so we turned around and rode back out.  I went out ahead of him, I got far enough ahead that I couldn't see him when turned to look to see if he was following.  Anyway I stopped to wait for him. I thought I smelt someting dead, or  like something peed there more then once. It was a really strong smell.  My first thought was a bear.  While  I was sitting there looking around I got this wierd feeling that some one was watching me.  I was really getting scared, I always carry a 44 mag with me, so I figure I can be pretty much safe when I'm out there, but not this time.  I decided to go find my husband, as I started my quad up I heard a branch break.  I'm still thinking bear, but the smell was awful. I started to pull away and I looked down and there over the tracks we made earlier going down the road were the biggest footprints I have ever seen, then I knew that was no bear. I took off, I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up.  He looked at me and said what's up?, you see a snake? So I showed him the tracks. Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe.  Then still he would say it was something else. He said that because the road was so dusty that the prints  looked larger then they actually were.  He said he didn't smell anything but a faint smell of something dead.  I wanted to believed him.  I never went back to that area again.", I saw nothing in the trees.  I cannot remember if I heard any birds.,"My husband was there, but refuses to be a witness to anything I tell you.

I didn't think much of it at first but there were rocks comming down the hill side and hitting the building.  This became more frequent and disturbing as the area above was trees and brush, not likely just a rock slide. The numer of times this occured also became much more frequent through out the weeks.     Then came a sort of rainy cloudy day in March of 2001, I think, when I was on the mountain by myself. At Lake Shasta Caverns we had tours leaving 3 times a day and it was the last one that day. From way up on top of the mountain you couldn't see much beyond you and I'd say the visiblity was 300 yards or less. My tour arrived and turned out to only be two people, a male and female. The bus driver  turned the bus around and returned to the bottom of the hill. As the three of us were standing there we were looking out across the ravine talking quietly  when we heard some rustling and distinct thumps on the ground. They asked me what it was and I just kept watching thearea it was comming from. As we were looking up and down the ravine 200yrds away, a never before noticed, but clearly viewable, skid  path was spotted by the man on my tour. He had a high pwered scope type camera and zoomed in. All the while we were still waiting to see what was moving down the ravine at such a high speed and moving the tops of what I thought to be pretty large trees on this path. And out of the overgrowth we saw it. Huge, on two feet arms clearly swinging wide in front of it and behind it. In a matter of 2 seconds or so it was no longer visible but we could still hear it. The thumping was it's feet running down hill to the water of the lake, straight down. The echo continued until suddenly a silence. I turned to the man and asked if he got it. He said,"" I don't know, I think so.""  I then immediatly ran for the emergency radio we keep in the storage/employee room and called down to the bus at the bottom. I told them what we all saw and to be careful and get up here, we want to go, NOW. My boss then came across and told me to calm down, get inside the building and wait there for the bus. When we got back across the lake to the main gift shop I exchanged numbers with the people on the tour but my boss kept theirs and I have not gotten anything from the from that day.

We had been climbing pretty steadily and were walking along a ridgeline, next to a densely forested downhill.  My sixteen year old son was leading, about 20 yds ahead.  I heard him let out a scream and immediately ran to see what was wrong.    I heard a large animal crashing down the hill to my right and caught a glimpse of a dark object which quickly disappeared into the vegetation.  Note at this time, my son was about 74 inches and 190 lbs.  I turned to him and asked ""What was it?""  His reply was ""I don't know.""  He and I stood there and discussed it for a while.  As he was walking up the trail he heard a rushing sound like something running toward him.  He glanced to his right and saw an animal running directly toward him. At this point he screamed. In his words it was bigger than he was and ran right past him on two legs and proceeded down the hill.  As I said, I caught a fleeting glimpse of part of something dark.

This was taxing because I was 8 months pragnant at the time.  We had just gotten to the top and I was going to sit on a big tree stump.

06051,2403,12383,2005,Summer,August,CA,Mono County, The trail goes into the Hoover Wilderness beginning at Leavitt Meadows Camp Ground.  South end of the meadow. ,Bridgeport,Highway 108.," We (my husband, my son, and myself) were in Mono County this past weekend, Sunday August 21st, 2005, for a day hike to Roosevelt Lake and its twin.  We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let's get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn't make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says ""What is that?""  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn't make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn't I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn't figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn't turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace.  We were on the trail above the meadow, looking down and appx. 500-800 yards a way from the object.  My husband believes the thing was following the pack trail. We left the trail and went down to the meadow.  We stayed on the trail side of the river.  The thing was on the opposite side of the river.  By this time it was gone or hidden from us.  The best way to describe it is like this.  The thing had a head that sat directly on its shoulders.  It did not appear to have a neck.  That is why we at first thought it was a backpacker.  It went head, broad shoulders or backpack, no neck, large body.  We could not discern its legs or arms due mostly to the angle at which it was leaving us. The grass in the Meadow obscured some of the legs. We have spent many hours in the woods, my husband was raised in Plumas county, neither he nor I have ever ever seen anything like this.  It could not have been a bear, they can't walk that far on 2 legs, nor that smoothly or quickly.  ","The only thing unusual was the fact that I heard something when we stopped to read the sign, it wasn't anything outstanding at the time, just a noise that led me to believe that someone else was on the trail behind us, but the interesting thing is that while we were down in the meadow, appx. 30 minutes or so, no one passed on the trail. Also the incident with the shouting between my son and whatever that was.  A bunch of little things that by themselves didn't mean anything and maybe still don't.","3 witnesses, walking down the trail heading for the truck.",,"3:15-3:30 P.M. Hot, slightly breezy, moderately cloudy.","Trail runs between ridge line and river.  Sparse trees on ridge, some willows and smaller-type trees follow the course of the river.

I do not want however, to have every kook in creation to come making trouble. I live at the edge of mining camp town. From my yard across the street on B. Road where my house sits there is really nothing but seventy plus miles of remote wilderness to the coast of California.  I don't know about disclosing the whereabouts at this time because it is so accessible. Plus my neighbors are probably going to kill me anyway.  How about hold on to it for now. I am telling you because I know how important the location is for the research aspects. There is a cave and an old mine at the end of a line drawn now from my house, to where the print was found, to where the cave is at. It is a perfect path around a hill through the forest to my house. There is a great vantage point for the thing to watch down on my property from where the print was found. It seems to be watching the place. Very smart...I think. ","Old Northern California mining camp, ","""B"" Rd.","My name is [TH], and I have lived in an old Mining Camp, in Northern California for the past two years. During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to I creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek.  I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a ""night bird"".  There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent.  I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near.   The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn't even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this.  I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek.  I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing.  At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.Bs deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. ""the Great American Bigfoot Research Team""]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek.  The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbors porch.  My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown.  There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me.  These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here? I would be delighted at any input.   Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005 OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story.  For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me.  A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area.   There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are ""huts"", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the ""huts"". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more.  I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.  Excerpters from Report # 20720:                                        August 09, 2007  It was four thirty in the morning as I opened the sliding glass door to my trailer looking east towards my yard and I Creek; I thought to myself, that's the biggest bear that I have ever seen. As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself' ""that's not a bear"". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!!  I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I'm not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie.  Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large ""bed"", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.     On with the story... Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that.  One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails.   There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent.  I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, ""Get out of here!"" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, Yeah kind of like that, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door.  A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbors yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes.  I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasnt expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation.  I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where ""beds"" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints. ","I hate to have to bring this up but I am going to mention it. I am brand new to this Bigfoot research stuff, and I am unaware for the most part about competition or conflicting opinions of researchers. I want everyone who is serious about Bigfoot to know about it because I think there really may be something here resembling and acting like a sasquatch. If this is true then my motivation is driven by my desire for everyone to know about it and to have a chance in being involved in something new? Have you been able to have a potential oppurtunity to study one in this way here? If it does come here seasonally than would this be the first time this oppurtunity has ever presented itself? ","The two times I saw it I was alone, but through these past two years my ex-boyfriend was there when we would call back to it when it would whistle at night. He also witnessed many accounts of the stench and the sounds of footfalls. For a while the only explanation we could come up with was it must be rocks moving down the creek, although the house is really to far away to hear that it was the only explanation we could come up with at the time.  OTHER WITNESSES from Report # 20720: No witnesses except for above and the one incident involving watching the cameras from the monitors inside my house. My friend, a ten year old girl said she saw a Bigfoot and a bear at the spring on the monitor. We looked back and saw the bear, and then the recording gets all funny and you do not see what she said was a Bigfoot.","Yes. In the past few months two of my neighbors, one just up the road saw one cross the street just up from his house early one morning. This is what prompted me to say something in the first place because he is thought of as a reliable person who can be believed. He does not want to be contacted. A man who lives down the road around the corner reported a sighting to J B's deli about a few weeks later. he had no idea about the other reports.   OTHER STORIES from Report # 12910: There is a load of them from this area across the Smith River down by Hiouchi and Gasquet. A forestry employee saw a Bigfoot on HWY 96 up river in full daylight right around the time mine started showing up, a man down my road saw one early one morning cross my road, a forestry employee saw one at the mouth of Elk creek and the Klamath River, which is close to me...I live on I Creek just up river from there.  A few of my neighbors say they have smelled them but not seen them. There is so much more and this thing is continuing.  OTHER STORIES from Report # 20720: Yes, but I am not at liberty to discuss them because the woman who saw it was a Forestry employee.  There are however many stories I have been told by the locals since then describing many fascinating things about who they call ""bushmen"", and ""oma"".  ",This thing is around from early-mid spring through early fall. I have had incidences mostly at around one and four in the morning,"There are two water features on this property that may be of interest. A large crerk,""I"" Creek, and a thermal spring that creates a nice pool where it emerges from the base of a maple tree in my yard. The spring winds down through the blackberries about 50 feet where it falls into the creek. Note that there are many trees and willows in the yard that through years of weight from blackberry vines have bent over and now form many ""rooms under the foliage. Some of these are quite large.  ENVIRONMENT from Report # 12910: I have around one and a half acres with a spring and a creek. The wilderness to the coast at Crescent City starts across the street from my house. There are lots of blackberries and fruit trees on my property. There are bent willows trees covered in blackberries that make nice places for big animals to hide... (I.e. bears, cougars, and Bigfoots).",

Our destination was Granite Lake, two miles from the outlet of Upper Blue Lake.  We reached our destination, had lunch and were returning, following the trail back the way we had come.  When we reached a pond, about 1/3rd of the way back, I expressed a desire to my wife to take a hike southward across the same elevation level as the pond, to another lake called Evergreen Lake. There is no trail or pathway to this lake, and I thought it would take about 20 minutes to reach it.  My wife declined to accompany me, so I told her I would return in a while.  I began walking, trying to keep my position along the same contour line as the pond.  The forest was fairly dense, and generally well covered with pine needle duff, generally underlayed with decomposed granite.  After a short walk, I realized that very likely few people had ever gone where I was headed, as there were no signs of previous travel, and the going was sometimes difficult.  I tried to stay on the contour, but kept slipping lower down I went.  After a while - more than 20 minutes, I realized that I wasn't going to find the lake, so I started back.  As I walked back I took a different route, trying to regain the elevation I had lost on the trip out.  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite, and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints.  The first set looked almost human, except they were wider and longer than usual.  Noticeable were the toes, and a definite arch.  The second set of prints were from a larger creature, and left a deeper impression, especially in the heal area.  This track was wider still than the first, and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints. There was no noticeable arch, and the toes were not especially evident. Both set of tracks were superimposed at points, indicating that one creature was directly following the other, stepping in the same spots at times.  The tracks quickly were lost in the pine needles further ahead.  It had snowed two days before, and the ground was damp, but most of the snow had melted.  These tracks were fresh, likely less than 24 hours old.  ",,No other witness was present at the tracks.,,"It was about 3:45 in the afternoon, and the sky was clear.

As I rode along, the lady giving me a ride into town told me to look out my window to the right. I looked to see what she was talking about and I saw a very large hairy creature walking across a wide, dried up creekbed.There were no trees or anything blocking my view. It was a wide open expanse.  I did not see its face because I was seeing it from the side. I only saw it on its right side. It was headed in the opposite direction that we were going. To our left I distinctly remember a ""watch out for falling rock sign."" I do not know the area there well. I was only camping there for a few days on my way back from Topanga Canyon in L.A. to Oregon where I lived in the Cave Junction area.  I will never forget what it looked like. It had long darkish brown hair that covered its entire body. It also had a pronounced crown in the shape of the top of his head. It looked extremely muscular. I was at least 500'away and I'm not real good at judging height anyways, so I don't know how tall it was.   It walked with ease across a rocky creekbed. It seemed to ignore or be unaware of our car's presence on the road. We were probably traveling about 30 mph when it happened.

The lake runs on sort of an angle from west/northwest to east/southeast.  Just above the lake when travelling north on hwy 154 is an access road leading into the forest to a point near the northwest end of the lake (probably about 2 1/2 miles from the lake).  Near that point and about 3/4 to one mile away from the ranger station located there, my friend and I hunted along the west side of the road.  We were both armed with high powered rifles (I had a 300 H&H Magnum with 200 grain roundnose bullets).  This is rough country!  We were sitting on a hillside looking down the hill when we noticed what seemed to be movement.  After about 1/2 hr or so, and not seeing any more movement, we decided to go and investigate what the movement had been below us on the hillside.  We crossed the trail which led into the area and went further down the hill toward the ranger station which was about 3/4 mile lower on the hillside around a bend.  Nothing was observed.  About 5-10 minutes later, we climbed back up the hill and onto the trail only to find some footprints.  The footprints were about 18 inches long and (although we did not measure them) approximately 40 inches apart.  Whatever made the prints was heavy because the prints were deep in the soil, much deeper than any person could have made (especially in that short a timeframe).  The prints lead along the trail going w/nw. and were on top of our footprints where we had crossed the trail going down the hill less than 10 minutes before.  We followed the prints for approximately 1 mile, but never saw anything except the continuing footprints.  We finally reached a vantage point  and could view the trail ahead for a mile or so.  It was empty, so we gave up and returned to the car.  Whatever made those prints was able to get far enough ahead of us that we could not catch up and it had to be far enough ahead to be out of view when we reached the vantage point.

I heard our dog whining. He never whined. No stranger let alone an animal could come close to our dog as he was an agressive watchdog. The whining is what woke me up.  I looked out the window from the couch and then looked again trying to focus. It was dark and everybody else was sleeping. I saw a dark outline of a creature looking into the front room.  I saw its silhouette against the night sky.  It had to have been taller than 6 foot, and the window, if I remember correctly, was off the ground 3? feet and the window itself was 4? feet tall.  The creature took up the width of the window and there probably was about 6-8 inches of moonlit sky showing above its head.  It made no sound.  It just stood there looking in.  I don't remember anything else.  I probably thought I must be dreaming, but the impression of something watching me never left me and I never told anyone about it until I told a trusted friend about a year ago.  However, other members of my family, including myself at that period of time, heard sounds that summer--like a low, steady whistle, sounding almost like a wind blowing through a groove of some kind.  This happened more than once.  When one of my uncles investigated with a rifle one night while we were playing cards, he came back shaken and unable to explain why.  The night would be silent except for the whistle noise.  Another time, I went exploring down the creek which ran out of a pond.  I got to the bottom of the ravine.  There was a smell, like sulphur, or something rotting, at a place where the water pooled.  It scared me and I ran back up the mountain.  I did not tell anyone because I was not suppose to go beyond the sight of the house.  ","I already told of the sounds heard from various family members at other occasions.

I was a climber for ten years and I have heard it all out there. This was different.   I was with my sons. We all wanted to camp in a bigfoot area, so we we went to a campground near Bluff Creek.  We were all in the tent and in our bags, the camp had settled down and all of a sudden there was a whoop! They were loud as if behind us, in succession whoop whoop bah-whoop!! And it seemed that there was more than one, I estimate three, one to the left of us, one behind us, and one off in front at a distance.  Also, something either took a large step or jumped off something, and it was big. The one behind us would call first and the one off in the distance would call back. The one to the left would whoop once, but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound. I figure the one behind us was the lead because he would call out and they would answer.   After about ten minutes the lead creature started to move off with the one to the left towards the other. I wanted to look out the tent but my youngest was with me who is 6 and was real scared, because the calls were so loud. I stayed with him and did not get to look till it was over.    I found no evidence in the morning, but earlier that day I noticed there were markings on a tree that was not made by a bear, almost as if the bark had been picked off. I have always followed this phenomenon and believed there was a possibility. This solidified everything. ","While walking earlier I found a small trail, and as I went further I noticed big branches blocking the path. The only problem was that this type of tree was a ways away from which it fell.

I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent.   I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking at or for. He pointed across the river and I was in shock when he pointed out the biggest, hairiest mammal I had ever seen just walking along the river side minding his own business. It stopped and looked at us. The way he stood on his hind legs was like an ordinary human. He had dark, long hair and stood about 7ft tall with a muscular build.   At this point I was the 4th person standing there in amazement. Maybe about 5 minutes of watching him watch us, with more people coming out with flashlights (because the sun was still going down) he darted in to the trees. He was running, taking long strides, and was gone in about 3 seconds.....and was literally pushing trees out of his way (not breaking them, but  pushing them out of his way). The trees behind him on his path up the mountain were swaying back and forth. I was surprised to see to these trees moving because they are thick in width and very tall.   By this time it was dark but lit enough to see which way he was headed. Up the mountain a little, there was a clearing, where we spotted him again before he disappeared for good. He made no noise, no yelling or screaming. He was just as timid as can be.  I have heard many stories about Bigfoot, and known that they are real but when seeing one in real life....you get a sense of respect for them and just have that feeling that there is more to life than you know.

I was around 8 or 10. We were camped on a river, with no one around for miles, and deer would frequently cross the river at our campsite. We kept our trash bagged up approx 30 yards from our camping area to deter bears from being drawn close to the camp area. We had 2 adult dogs and 5 newborn puppies as well. The female dog had pups on the trip.   It was late at night approx 10 pm and my sister and I were in our tents sleeping and my parents were at the fire talking. My father put a few paper bags on the fire which caused it to rise quite dramatically and thats when it started. From approx 50 yards near the trash area, came the loudest shrillest most powerful scream that my first thought was a fire engine (I was young). The adult dogs, including the protective mother started whimpering. They were medium sized dogs, not huge but not small either.   The scream started traveling down river at a rapid pace. It died off to a deep growl. Whatever it was, it was very large, you could feel the immensity. You could hear this thing for what seemed to me was an eternity but honestly was probably a good few minutes.   I went to the bottom of my sleeping bag and all I can remember is that I was terrified. My sister was awake at this point and the next thing I remember was my father unzipping the tent asking us if we had heard that, we replied and the next question was if we wanted to go or stay. Now, my father was a forest fire fighter for 12 years and an avid hunter and outdoorsman. He was one of the first people to have been helicoptered into a fire in California, and he had heard just about everything in the woods. This man was scared.  Unfortunately he did not bring his rifle with us on that trip he always had his trusty 30-30, why not this time I dont know. I remember seeing the fear in his eyes, and I was already scared, so it was unanimous. We packed up that night and drove 8 hours to our home in Ventura California.   We had never thought about a Sasquatch up until that point. It wasnt until we were watching an episode of ""In Search Of"" with Leonard Nemoy back in the day that they had what they said was an actual Sasquatch vocalization. I remember all of us watching it in our living room and hearing that noise on the TV and all of us looked at each other, it was the same noise. To this day I wish to god we would have stayed until morning to see footprints or something.   My parents were very no nonsense nonbelievers in just about all questionable things. Now we all believe in Sasquatch. Why did the dogs whimper? What was the huge animal that made that sound traveling so fast? What made my father so afraid that he packed us up and we left at midnight for an 8 hour plus drive home? I wish we would have stuck it out until daybreak.

It was about 22:00, slightly over cast and very calm and quiet. In hindsight I remember how odd it was for it to be that quiet on a Saturday night on Lake Shasta. Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small, almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant 'pop' sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken, again never hitting the ground. Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction. Then after a few more minutes had passed I heard another branch break about 10 yards from were I was.   I woke up one of the other fellows that were camping with me and told him something was coming up on us and I had no idea what it was. We then heard about 3 or 4 more footsteps and that was it. My friend took up refuge in the camper at this point. I didn't see anything as it was very dark and whatever this was was in an area of trees.   I have been camping in the woods since I was a very young boy and have encountered just about every type of animal there is, at least in California. This was definitely walking on two feet. I'm confident that it was not a bear because they generally don't take very long strides when they stand on two feet. Furthermore most of the bears that I have encountered in this region are black bears and not very large.   I'm submitting this in hopes for an explanation.  Was it a deer in season or a rabid bear or what I don't know, I'm at a loss. ",,none.,,Approx 2200 Hrs.,"Lakeshore, slightly hilly, edged by medium dense forest.",19

Elevation was around 8000-9000 feet I believe.",10 miles South of Sierraville,,"On Labor day weekend 1993, I went camping with two friends of mine, Brian and Steve. We went to an area that had a little lake with an un-improved campground. My parents went up there that Friday morning and we went after work as Brian and I worked at the same place. We picked up Steve on the way out there. We got to the lake at around 9pm Friday night, and after setting up our camp, we sat and talked half the night. The camp was on the north end of the lake. There was a marsh area that had very thick underbrush to the immediate west of our camp. This marsh area extended to almost the southwest of the lake. If you picture a clock, the marsh area would be from the 8'0 clock to the 12'0 clock position.   After spending all day Saturday fishing with my folks and having a great time, we all settled down and relaxed at the camp. We had dinner and built a campfire and we all stared into the fire telling stories until my folks went to bed. At around midnight, Steve, Brian and I were sitting around the fire when I thought I heard something in the marsh area. It sounded like something walking through there. Steve didn't hear it and I just dismissed it at first. But Brian and I kept hearing it. It soundedd like something going back and forth like it was pacing the camp. I knew no one was camped in that area, so I just thought it was an animal. This went on for about an hour and a half. I even jokeed to Steve that the tent he and Brian were sleeping in was just giftwrap to a bear if one came after them and I'd sleep really good in the back of my truck.  The next morning my folks decided to go home early. My friends and I decided to stay there a couple more days because Brian and I didn't have to go to work until the following Thursday. By two that afternoon, we pretty much had the whole lake all to ourselves except for a couple of other groups of campers. At 2:30 Sunday afternoon, the three of us piled into my truck to hunt for firewood. We took a dirt road that went east to west along a ridge directly off of the lake's entrance road about 1/8th mile from our camp. We were following this road in a pretty thick patch of woods for about a mile when it suddenly opened up into a meadow about 300 meters below the ridgeline of the hill we were on. There was another patch of woods to our south that paralleled the road for about 2 or 3 miles. I stopped the truck because we saw a ton of good firewood.   Brian and Steve went in a southeast direction away from the front of the truck while I grabbed my axe and headed in a northern direction towards some logs so we could get some ""all night burners"". I got about 30 ft from the truck when I saw it.  At first I didn't know what I was seeing. It was a hairy thing sitting down against a tree with it's back towards me. It was in the treeline we had just come out of. It was only 60 yards from me at most. I stood there frozen because I thought it might be a bear and I only had an axe and I didn't feel like being any kind of hero. After maybe 5 seconds, it stood up on 2 legs. It looked massive, like 8 to 8 1/2 foot tall and at least 3 1/2 to 4 feet wide. It had reddish-brown hair all over it and it matched the color of the bark on the trees perfectly. It had huge hands that came down to just above it's knees. It grabbed onto the trees just to guide itself through them, not push them aside. There were some pretty good sized trees in that patch of woods and they looked small when this thing grabbed them. It walked away from me towards the crest of the hill and I was amazed at how smoothly it moved.   It was weaving in and out of the trees stealthily and it never made a sound, not a grunt, not a wheeze, nothing. I didn't even hear footsteps. As it got near the top of the hill, it stopped and looked down into the next valley to the North and it just walked on over the hill never even looking back at me. I couldn't see it's face. I didn't see a neck either, just it's head set kinda on top of it's shoulders.   I stood there for about 10 seconds when I got the nerve up to get the hell out of there. I backed down the hill to the truck and I noticed that Brian and Steve were still gathering wood. I joined up with them after I got a soda from the truck and I calmed down. I gathered some wood with them and we got out of there. They never saw it. We stayed there another couple of nights, but we didn't have another incident for the whole trip. I didn't tell them what I saw because they wouldn't have believed it. I never told anyone about it until I told my parents and my fiance' about it a couple of months ago after I saw your web site.

My friend was just out of boot camp USMC and we started hiking as often as time would allow.  We were hiking down a small stream bed that went down hill. The stream was all dried up and it was mostly rock hopping until we got to the bottom of the hill, at one point there is a small section off to the side that is just dirt and makes for a much easier walk down to the bottom.  When we got to the bottom we hiked a bit more but as the sun started to go down, we headed back up the same hill/creek bed. I followed my own boot tracks back up as I was tired of rock hopping, while going up, the smell in the air was horrible, like rotten eggs or portable toilet, I then noticed on one of my tracks laid a dead ground squirrel, right over my boot track. I pointed this out to my friend and as soon as I did this, a loud banging over a short hill side was heard, it was coming from about 35-50 yards away from us. It sounded as if it was a large log being hit against a tree.  I looked at where the noise was coming from and noticed the tops of the trees were swaying back and forth; all this time of the swaying of the trees the pounding on them could be heard.  Then the pounding stopped and a loud groan/scream was heard from the same area as the pounding of the trees. I have never heard anything like it. Ive heard Mt Lion, Black bear, this was nothing like that, and was very-very loud, to the point is was damn scary. My friend asked if we should look over the small hillside to see what was making the noise. I said no way, and he agreed. When we started walking away the banging and screaming would stop, but as soon as we stopped it would proceed with the groan and screaming and the trees would start swaying.  We finally got out of there and my friend did not want to talk about what had happened.

We made it up to the saddle where the trail goes downhill into the wilderness, and where we were supposed to leave the trail and go south up the mountain, and decided we didn't feel like going any further. I'm assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound. My first thought was that it was probably a bear, but that ultimately I had no idea what it was, and it sounded like it was growling at us. The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn't see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail. I'm not sure if we ever spoke about it again, except to maybe say I wonder what it was, that was scary, etc.  But afterwards I actually looked through field guides trying to figure out what was making the noise. I knew that bears, mountain lions & bobcats are relatively prevalent in that part of the San Gabriel Mountains, so assumed it was probably one of those. But, after browsing around your site, and seeing several sightings near the SG Wilderness listed, I'm beginning to wonder. In retrospect (although it could be my overactive imagination), it sounded a bit apelike.

Then I heard a very loud howl, which certainly didn't sound like any dog I've ever heard.  It reminded me of a Gibbon call in the zoo; more ape-like than dog.  The dogs continued to bray, and the howler got louder and tended to drown them out.  It did not sound like a fight but rather, a bunch of animals having a verbal argument over their respective territories.  This went on for several minutes - perhaps 5 - until the animals grew tired of their noisy discourse.  It presently stopped.

06109,2658,15197,2006,Summer,July,CA,Tuolumne County,THE SOUNDS WERE HEARD AT LAKE MORAN.   [Specifics and coordinates removed from submission at the request of the witnesses],Dorrington,Hwy 4 ,"On 7/3/06 around 4:35pm, I (age 42) took my two sons, ages 7 & 8 to a nearby lake while my husband stayed behind to continue building our cabin. It's a hard 23 minute, offroad drive of 4.3 miles, so we were very specific about our departure and return times, just in case my husband would need to come looking for us.   After unsuccessfully looking for a wading spot near our truck, (mucky water, underwater plants and drop-offs) the boys and I made quite a trek to a prior favorite point that juts out like a partial island, with fishing nets, swimsuits and snacks. The path has become almost non-existent due to fallen trees, branches and almost no foot traffic. This is a very remote lake, not visible from any main forest service road. Our whole trip consisted of 1 1/3 hours at the lake.   We were dipping our toes and talking about the fish, when I said we needed to pack it up. I had just heard a noise in the far distance of what sounded like a single, medium tone ""whoop or yup"" (#1). I told the boys to be quiet for a minute and this time we all heard it (#2). None of us could identify it, so I yelled, ""Hello?"" and waited. It responded again with a single ""whoop"" (#3) which sounded significantly louder.  The boys caught on to this right away, and said, Mom, its getting closer.  We thought it might be a hurt backpacker off in the distance, so I yelled, ""Is anybody out there?"" Each response was about 30-60 seconds and this time it was very loud and close (#4).   I thought someone was playing a joke on us at first, but realized I could neither see, nor identify the sound.   The frightening issue was that no other sound was made as it approached us. I expected sticks and twigs to be snapping, so I wrote it off as some curious bird moving quickly between trees (mostly for the boys sake).  There was a golden mantel chipmunk in the distance that was very upset about something, but everything else was eerily quiet. I felt like we were being watched the whole time, but never said anything because I didn't want to spook the boys.  I experienced the same ""watched"" feeling the last time we were at that spot (last year) and remember hearing what I thought was a deer walking around us, but I never saw anything.  We packed up fast and bee-lined it to the pickup. I did not want to be stuck on a spit of land with two young kids that are just learning to swim. I could have made it across the lake to the truck, but not the boys.   It sounded like a cross between a human and animal that was made by something very large. It was absolutely not a bird (quail/woodpecker), bear or cougar sound. Last year on two separate occasions, we had a young cougar, then a bear run in front of our pickup and we're very familiar with their ""walking and verbal""  sounds. I have been camping all of my life and have never experienced that sound before. I had my digital camera with me and never once thought to put it in Video mode to record the sounds. The whole thing took place over a 5 minute period and we were just focusing on getting back to the pickup.   I was born and raised in Port Orchard, WA, so I'm very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales. I have always felt they could be real, but have never had any encounter with one. I decided to poke around online to see what a Yeti might sound like and read John Bindernagel's research. My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous. I also read about the BFRO expeditions in Northern California and Humboldt County, along with a lot of other information and projects.   I decided to respond to you with my information for whatever its worth.  I cant explain it, and both of the boys have very vivid and accurate memories of what we all heard.

At one point during the whoop/howl, it almost sounded like there was two ""animals/things"" making this strange noise.  ","The whoop-howl lasted for 3 to 4 minutes. We have listened to all the sound recordings you have on your wesite, two of them sound very similar to what we heard. 1)1973 Puyallup, Washington 2) 1978 Snohomish County, Washington but it sounds almost identical to  the sound recording you have from 1993 Del Norte County, California.","Yes.

06089,2696,15540,1970,Summer,August,CA,Shasta County,"This was at the McCloud Campsite on Lake Shasta. It was before I knew how to drive so I do not recall highways and such. I have no idea if McCloud is still there. It was pretty popular then though, but not over corwded. For all I know it could be a huge hotel and casino by now ... I hope not. It was quite rustic at the time I was there in 1970.",Lakehead,Gilman Rd.,"I was on a family camping trip. There were a lot of us. I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot. The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters, their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5'10"".  As for myself, I really wanted to see a bear. I was a very outdoorsy kid and would have preferred to sleep outside of the tent actually. I had little fear of the dark, or the night, and it was my goal to see a bear. I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it, my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen.  I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn't wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag, and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright.  I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn't a position of comfort for them. For that matter, they don't just 'stand' next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast, but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary.  What happened was that as I saw them, and saw that they were something unexpected, I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true 'gasp' I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then, they turned and looked at each other, looked back at me again, and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there, and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it, but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen.  The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks, but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn't see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace, but I didn't. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods.  I didn't tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know, kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well.  Oh, what I saw of them ... Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn't catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female, but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren't words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting.   I didn't know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage. I was so excited to see something that looked like what I had seen. I am 49 now ... I will never forget.    ","Well, there was a strangeness about it all like it just seemed staged or something. If they had been standing anywhere else I would have not had such a clear gauge of their height and bigness. They were just standing there like they were waiting for somethng to happen. I did not have the impression that they were interested in the food bag itself, but they were standing directly under it. Do I think it was persons in hairy outfits standing in our campsite in the middle of the night? No. It did feel strangely like a staged event though. That has always been a mystery to me.",Just myself ... ,No.,"Sometime in the middle of the night while camping. Lighting was not good enough to see great detail, but plenty good enough to make out eye contact.", It was pine forest at the edge of the lake. The lake level had dropped a few years before leaving a wide band of exposed bank that was mostly rock covered in the area where we were. Beyond our campsite was a dry creekbed that I am sure was a stream in the rainy season. Our camp was at the west (?) edge of the camp grounds up on a hill area away from the central grounds. ,unknown

06045,2716,15782,2006,Fall,September,CA,Mendocino County,,Navarro,128 highway,"Re: Our Bigfoot encounter in California My wife and I have had two incidents over the year, including vocalization and wood knocking. We are San Francisco City people, artist; not hunters. We are not used to the outdoors or accustom to the forest and nature and the shock of fresh clean air.  The first encounter was on Tuesday evening, 8/16/05 at 5:17pm on highway 128 in the Redwood forest. We were on a vacation, driving west on 128 and heading towards Fort Bragg, CA. Once we entered the state park, we stopped and parked to smell the fresh air. I marked the time, because I was shooting with my digital camera. We walked into the forest, on a trail, and were having a great time, enjoying our time alone. There was little traffic or noise from the road. The forest was quiet and powerful. We have lived in the center of San Francisco for 15 years, and were stunned and amazed to experience the silence and peace of the Redwoods. As we got deeper into the woods, about 20 minutes, I started to get uneasy; feeling like someone was watching us. The digital photos my wife took of me show my concern, the longer we stayed. Then we heard it.  It was a growl-grunting. Just above the hearing of my ears. I would described it as infra-sound- a deep sound that was low in pitch, deep, almost inaudible. My body felt it more than my ears. It threw me in a panic. The fear in me rose fast. I looked at my wife and she was feeling the panic. We both looked around. We could not tell the direction. We could not see anything in the thick woods around us. It could have been a bear or a wolf. But my instincts said no. I did not know what it was. But, the ""vibe"" message was becoming clear- GO AWAY NOW!   Predators do not warn-they ambush-right? My wife looked at me and said Did you hear that? I said Yes. She said, Lets get back to the car. I said Good idea!  It was a weird feeling. We were stunned and mystified as we ran back to the car. We drove away nervous and excited about what happened. On our way to Fort Bragg, CA, we were talking about the experience. Was it a bigfoot? Did we have a Bigfoot encounter? We felt something special had just happened. We had to learn more about bigfoots.    Over the year, I became obsessed with bigfoots. I read as mush as I could about the Sasquatch, Yeren, Almasty, and Yeti as my time permit. My wife became obsessed also. Together we decided to go back to those redwoods and try to make contact with the forest giants.   We made it back to highway 128 on Monday 9/4/06. Something told me to pull over at a different spot. As soon as I got out, I had the DV video camera running. On the camera my wife tells me to make my Whoop-Whoop Bigfoot call, into the redwood forest. As soon as I did, the camera records wood knocking and tree breaking. Soon the smell of a dead animal/skunk filled the air.   The sounds and smells go on for about three minutes,  then stops. I could tell he moved away after my calls to him, inviting him to be photographed. We left the redwood forest, excited about our contact.   My wife wants to see a bigfoot. I do not want to see him.  I hear that many people die or have very bad luck after seeing a Bigfoot. Remember Dr. Morbius from the movie Forbidden Planet? Maybe Bigfoot is the ID, coagulated from the quantum soup of our collective unconscious mind.

06017,2717,15821,2005,Summer,August,CA,El Dorado County,trail from Wright's Lake to Enchanted Pools,Wright's Lake,Wright's road,"I used to live in Camino, CA and would go up into Desolation Wilderness as often as I could. The trout fishing was really incredible and it left a wonderful lasting memory with me. Since moving from the area, I hadn't been there in several years. I talked to a friend of mine about going up and camp overnight and do some stream fishing. He agreed and also invited another friend along for the ride.   We got up there in the early afternoon and hiked upstream from Wright's lake and then set up camp. A couple hours later a ranger came by and informed us that we hadn't actually made it into Desolation Wilderness yet, and that we needed to keep hiking for a while. We broke camp and then the 2 guys that were with me, suggested that we go into Placerville and get a room. Apparently they weren't up to camping and fishing after all. I said no thanks and that I wanted to come up here, to come up there and fish, not go party somewhere in town. So they left and I went up the hill farther. The ranger had suggested a great camping and fishing location, but because it was starting to get later in the afternoon, there was no way I would make it all the way before dark. He gave me a general location of where it could be found and what trails to take to get there, but when most of the area is large (football field size) sheets of granite, the trails are only marked with stacks of rocks and they are few and far between.   I ended up getting lost a bit, but I could hear the stream flowing over rocks to the north of me. I walked in another half mile or so and located the stream. Below me about 35 feet down a granite cliff was a stream that did have a pool in it, right on the tree line. I thought what a beautiful place that would be to have a campsite and then picked my way down the steep cliff side. I set up my camp directly next to the pool and also with the treeline and some very dense woods about 6 feet away to the north. The pool was on the east side of me. I started fishing as soon as my tent was back up and had a gorgeous finish to a very nice day. Then after it got dark, I climbed into my sleeping bag looking to the east to the Crystal range, I think it is called, and watched as the glow of a full moon worked it's way up over the top of the granite mountains. Once it was over, my day was complete and I decided to go to sleep. That was at 10:30 pm.   As I started to drift off to sleep, I heard what can only be described as a very low rumbling growl. When I go into a wilderness area, especially a place I know has bears really thick, I always carry a handgun with me. On this occassion it was a .45 compact. When I heard the growl, it really scared the crap out of me, because it was so close. I jumped up, with my .45 in hand and looked out the top of the screen mesh on the tent. I could see a dark mass about 4 1/2 feet tall, right at the edge of the tree line, 6 feet from my head. I yelled some really loud obscenities and started climbing out of my tent. Once I was clear of the door I brought up my pistol and fired into a dead tree a few feet away from what I thought was a big black bear. As soon as the pistol went off, it turned and ran back into the brush, but it didn't seem to go very far and that concerned me. Bears will usually run like heck and for a long time when they get a shot that close. This seemed to go maybe 50 feet or so into very thick brush. I could hear it thrashing about as it moved deeper into the trees, but then it just stopped. It all went quiet for about 15 minutes or so and then I tried going back to bed. Shortly after I started hearing what sounded like somewhat large rocks, hitting in the water, just above the pool I was camped beside. It would happen every couple of minutes or so. It was the sound of not only the splash, but also of the rock hitting other rocks, submerged in shin deep water. That ""cracking"" sound. This really concerned me, thinking the ""bear"" may be circling my campsite and trying to get at me from a different angle. I got out out my tent on several occasions, and was trying to see if I could make out any movement on the other side of the stream but nothing. I usually keep a small flashlight in my tackle box, which I had, but it was one of those small ""shake it"" and it charges up the cell and lights up for a few minutes. Not much of a flashlight really and worse yet, the handle is clear and so when I would turn it on, the handle would light up too, actually making it harder to see. I had a full moon though and the area is surrounded with stark white granite slabs, and so except in the darkest of the woods, I could see pretty clearly. This went on like this until 2:00 am. That was when I got another ""visit"". I didn't get to see it, this time, but I heard movement really close to my tent again, same place as the first time, and when I yelled at it, I got a return of something that sounded like an ""Ooof"" ""Ooof"", but really deep sounding. I jumped out of my tent again thinking I was going to see it again, but didnt. Still, I put another shot into the dead tree and off it went crashing through the brush again. Again it only went about 50 feet back. There was something odd about the way it sounded when it was running too. I didn't catch what it was though until I listened to the footsteps of a bipedal walking from your site here. It was only on two feet!! It concerned me enough to realize that it didn't sound like a 4 legged animal at the time, but I didn't know what was different until I heard your recordings. Anyway, still thinking I was dealing with a rogue bear, I started trying to figure out what it wanted with me. Was I camped on it's trail to the water? Was it used to finding food in tents? Desolation is a very high traffic place. This particular place was a ways off the trail and it didn't appear to have much in the way of hikers. Hikers usually leave some kind of sign, trash, fish hooks, something to say that they were here before, but this place was very clean.   So I decide to take my sleeping bag out of the tent and move over to the middle of this big slab of granite that I am on. There is about a 4 foot tall ledge facing the woods where all the activity was going on. But now the treeline is 50 feet away and not 6. Figuring this would give me some advance warning if I got charged. The rocks kept flying, and I kept trying to sleep with one eye open, hoping the sun would come up soon, and checking my watch all night long. Then ""she"" showed up. It was 4:40 am and something woke me. I heard movement at the tree line again and I looked to where it all started from. I didn't see anything but then I looked at my tent. Standing right next to my tent was the ""creature?"". My tent is about 4 feet tall maybe a little less and what I saw was more than twice as tall. At first I couldn't see any features, just the outline. Then it took a couple of steps towards me. I almost pee'd my pants right there. I picked up the .45 and took a shot off to the left of it. It stopped and looked at me. Then it started walking towards me again. It was very fast. I don't mean that it was running, it's just that the steps were so big, the distance was closing very fast. Had it been a bear, I would have shot it immediately, but honestly, I don't think my .45 would have been able to stop it. One shot would definitely not killed it or stopped it in its tracks. Then as it was approaching me, I took another shot, but this one much closer. I could see it very clearly at this point and yes I did pee my pants. The second shot made her stop again, and then she took off running to the northwest through an area of mostly granite slab and dotted with scrub pine. This was the last time I saw her. She ran off out of sight at great speed. I stayed up the rest of the night until it got light enough for me to hike back towards Wrights Lake to the South West. For the remainder of the darkness I pretty much stayed put with the ledge to my back and my gun in my hand, and shaking in my skin. I have not been able to sleep right since then, and for the next couple of months after the incident, I couldn't sleep at all. Everytime I closed my eyes, I would hear the growls and the rocks splashing and then see her coming at me. I would be willing to take someone back up there to show where it happened, but only during daylight hours. I have been a hunter and fisherman most of my life and have seen what I thought, was every animal in the woods at one time or another. Nothing like this has ever shown it's face before, and I hope it never does again.  There was another incident however. On December 13th, 1992 up in Snow Mountain Wilderness area, above Elk Creek California. I would be willing to talk to someone about this also.","There was so much going on. At first, there was the growl heard right outside my tent, and when I jumped up and looked out the rain fly on top, I could see it, crouched down. This is what made me intially think it was a large bear. It was a large mass about 4 1/2 feet tall tucked in the treeline about 6 feet away. When I jumped out and yelled at ""it"" and then fired my .45 into a dead tree a few feet away, it ran away into the brush, but only about 50 feet back into the woods. This I thought was unusual, because a bear will usually take off running and not stop until sunrise! After about 15 mintues it got really quiet and I assumed it had left the area. But thats when the rocks started landing in the water just upstream about 20 yards. This went on all night long. Just as I was ready to get back to sleep, another rock or two would hit the shallow stream and make a splash as well as the rock on rock ""cracking""  noise. That was followed up by another visit at 2:00 am and then the biggy at 4:40am.",No. Unfortunately it was only me.,"no not in this area, and I have been going there for many years.

There was one time when we spent the night at Dark Lake, that we had footsteps all around our campsite and it kept us up all night, not knowing for sure what it was, and there was some wood knocking going on then too. But other than that, the only other time where I had an encounter was a hunting trip into the Snow Mountain wilderness area up above Elk Creek, California.

This area is not easily accessible because of the terrain and the road being obstructed by snow in some areas.  As I was coming back down the canyon I came to an open spot along the side of the mountain heading into a more wooded area next to a meadow. The meadow was about 300 yards away.  I was looking ahead of meyself at the beginning of the wooded area  when I saw a human like creature cross the road heading towards the meadow. Its gait was very unhuman like bent at the waist and  arms swinging like you might see a vaudeville actor do at the end of a show as they exit the stage, a bit looney tunes like. I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides. It was all black, long arms (longer than ours), tall, muscular, and slim with no neck visible. It must of been at least 7 to 8 ft. tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs. I reached for my camera and that is when I saw it cross back over the road again this time in a slow more human like gait like it was trying to elude something without illiciting a chase response from whatever it was trying to elude like you might do if you saw a growling dog.  ",It appeared like the creature was trying to cross before the oncoming truck came to that location.

06109,2750,16448,2001,Fall,September,CA,Tuolumne County,Popular area off Highway 108 corridor. Clark Fork campground is located next to the Clark Fork (river) near the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness in the Stanislaus National Forest.,"Dardanelle, CA",Clark Fork Road,"I noticed a report on your website from September of 2001 at the Sand Flat campground (State of California, County of Tuolumne). The hair stood up on my neck when I read this due to the similarities with my experience. My experience occurred the same month and year at the Clark Fork campground, about one mile Southwest of Sand Flat.  My wife and I arrived at the Clark Fork campground on Thursday, September 20th 2001. This was our first ever September camping trip (we usually go in mid-August). We were surprised at how few people were in the campground compared to our 4 previous trips to this area. One factor that probably lead to the extremely low occupancy was that the 9/11 terrorist attacks had happened the week before. Out of 88 camp sites, probably only twelve were occupied. We set up our camp in the B loop and settled in. The B loop is our favorite of the 2 campground loops. It has a slightly nicer setting (more pine trees, nicer bathrooms, etc.) and is closer to the wilderness than the A loop. But on Sunday the 23rd, the two retiree campground hosts told us the B loop was closing for the season and that we would need to move to the A loop of we were going to stay.  After relocating to the A loop on Sunday morning we noticed that there was only two other campsites occupied. All other campers had left. One group was a young couple with two very young children, the other was two older men in their 60s or 70s with a trailer. I had never seen so few people in this area. It was really nice to practically have the whole place to ourselves. It was very quiet.  Sunday night it rained hard, and we spent most of Monday morning patching our leaky tent and drying everything out. On Monday night, we did as we always did before bed: played cards and listened to the radio. We climbed into our tent and went to bed at about 10:00 p.m.  Late that night after 2 a.m., I slowly came out of a deep sleep due to high-pitch noise which I initially thought was a wounded coyote. After I was fully awake, the noise got much louder. It was clearly a screaming sound rather than howling, yipping, yelling, or shouting. The screaming appeared to be coming from the Clark Fork River area, north of the access road which leads to the campground. The sound got progressively louder and was obviously not from a canine.   I wondered if any human being could make a sound so loud, long, and hideous. The sound changed pitch and tempo many times. My wife woke up about a minute into the screaming. She asked, Why is that man screaming? I had no idea what could have made such a sound but it was very unsettling. My wife said it sounded like a man was being murdered out in the forest, but then commented that a person couldnt make a sound like that. Whatever made these sounds had to have an enormous lung capacity. The screaming went on for about 5 full minutes before it stopped. I laid awake for a while, nervous and wondering what it could have been. Frankly I didnt want to know.  As I drifted off to sleep about an hour later, I was awakened by a very loud metal-on-metal bang coming from the closed B loop portion of the campground. It was obvious to me that the sound was one of the bear-proof dumpster lids being lifted up and then dropped. Ive heard the sound many times. Now thats fine and dandy, except that it was 3:00 a.m., bears cant open the dumpster lids, and there was no one else in the area where the sound came from. The B loop was closed. This really bothered me. I did not fall asleep until almost dawn. I laid clutching a pistol with my heart racing every time I heard a rustle outside of our tent. I refused to leave the tent until it was light.  I have heard hundreds of coyotes throughout the years, both in the Sierras and in the California desert, and this screaming was not a coyote. As for the possibility of a mountain lion making these sounds, I would bet my life that it wasnt a feline. Ive heard mountain lions make some strange noises, but the bottom line is that a cat sounds like a cat. Its easy to distinguish between noises a feline, a canine, or a bear makes. The screaming that my wife and I heard was none of these.","At about 3 oclock in the afternoon on Monday, my wife and I were sitting at our picnic table and were startled to see a large deer running  through our campsite at full bore. I couldnt understand why the deer ran right through our site, within 75 feet of our picnic table, when there was so much open space all around us. I thought that perhaps we would see a mountain lion right behind the deer, chasing it. But nothing came.  It had come from direction of the B loop, which was completely abandoned, closed off and quiet. I wanted to walk over to the B loop and look around, but intuition told me to stay put.

I am an avid backpacker and have backpacked extensively in the western states, in the wildest and remotest regions, and have encountered many large wild animals including grizzly bears. Never before nor since have I had such an odd experience as this one.   I left one Friday evening (August 1, 1986) by myself after work with my dogs (at the time my family had a beagle and a poodle, I'll take anything hiking with me!), and I was trying to find a lake up in Tahoe National Forest called White Rock Lake. I had never been there before so I wasn't familiar with the unmarked roads. According to the topo map I could get there via a 4-wheel drive road.   Way back behind Truckee, northeast of Fordyce Lake, I found myself driving slowly, at night, on rough rocky dirt roads, trying to figure out where I was. Roads would seem to peter out, or bisect with other 4-wheel drive roads, and I had no clue where I was going. I was way out in the middle of nowhere... no lakes or significant creeks or any destination type areas within miles.   I decided to wait until daylight before I confused myself anymore in the darkness. I'm sure I didn't even need to pull off the little ""road"" I was on since I hadn't seen anyone or anything, but just in case, I did. I pulled off the rocky road just a few yards, my Datsun 4-wheel drive pickup hidden by trees. I grabbed my sleeping bag, tossed it outside in front of my truck, and me and my dogs slept under a very starry night.   Sometime early in the morning, around 3 or 4 a.m. (it was still pitch black), I awoke and heard something walking up the road in my direction. I could tell it was heavy, and it was walking steadily my way. At first I thought it must've been a backpacker, as it was obviously bipedal by the rhythm of the walk. The steps were distinct. Then I thought to myself, what would a backpacker be doing way out here on this road, in the middle of the night, with no light, with nothing but miles of thick forest in all directions? I knew it wasn't a bear (I've encountered dozens of bears in my years in the wild). I had no idea what this was, but a backpacker was still my best guess.   As it got closer and closer, I wondered if I should say something, but I didn't want to scare anyone unnecessarily. I'm sure it would just walk right by. But, for some reason, I was getting increasingly nervous, and there aren't too many things in the wilderness that make me nervous. The odd thing was my dogs weren't making a sound, or a move for that matter, which added to the suspense. My dogs would have normally at least given a warning bark or two. This heavy, bipedal thing was coming closer and closer and was about to come to the point where I had pulled my truck off the road. I laid there very quietly. I didn't know what to expect, and hoped whatever or whoever it was would just continue on by, not even noticing me. It was so dark I couldn't see a thing.   The closer it got, the bigger I realized it must be, because through the rhythm of the walk I could tell it was quite large. I stayed silent in my nervousness. A sasquatch was the last thing on my mind as I hadn't really given much thought in the past to such a thing, especially in the Sierras. That was about to change. It came up to where I had parked my truck off the road, and... silence. It stopped. Although I couldn't see it in the darkness, it was only a few yards away from where I was laying in my sleeping bag.   I don't know if I made a sound, or one of my dogs made a sound, but something happened that made it react. This thing let out the most heinous, forest-piercing scream you could imagine. I can't even attempt to put in words what this thing sounded like. It had a set of lungs on it like nothing I could describe or accurately imitate. Then, still screaming, it turned around and ran back down the road in the darkness at a fast rate of speed. It screamed the whole time, echoing through the forest. It never let up. I could hear the screams fading in the distance.  I laid there in total shock. I couldn't believe what just happened. Eventually I jumped up and tossed everything in my truck. My dogs acted just as freaked as me. I knew whatever it was a long distance away by this point, so before leaving the area I drove down the road with my brights on, trying to see if I could see any footprints or signs of anything odd. My adrenaline was flowing big time. Although I didn't actually get out of the truck, I opened the door and looked down to see if I could see footprints or any clue of what this thing was. The road was too rocky for footprints. I then let my dogs out, hoping they would pick up a scent (although I didn't know what I'd do if they did), but oddly they jumped right back in the truck. This was out of character for them. I tossed them back out again, and they jumped right back in. I decided if they're as freaked out as I am, I better get the heck out of there and I drove many miles back towards the main road.   I hadn't thought much of a sasquatch before this experience, but now I'm certainly a believer. People try and explain it away to me, but I know what I heard. I didn't see it, nor did I smell anything, but it was so close I could feel it. And it was so close when it screamed that I'm surprised I didn't get spit on. Nothing in those forests could scream like that, nor run that fast, especially nothing that walked upright. I don't dwell on the bigfoot subject, nor have I made it a mission to seek them out, but I know theyre out there. My experience is still very vivid. It doesn't matter to me whether someone believes it or not. I'm not submitting this report to convince anyone otherwise. I'm just sharing an experience I had in the Sierras one night, near Truckee.

06087,2773,16691,1958,Spring,April,CA,Santa Cruz County,This is near the epicenter of the '89 Earthquake. The area specifically where this happened is called Hinkley Basin. This in now part of Nisine Marks State Park.,Aptos,Olive Springs Rd.,"This happened 48 years ago. I was a boy 13 years old and my friend and I were riding our bikes in a remote part of the Santa Cruz Mts. in what today is a State Park. However, at the time this was private land that had been logged over in the late 1800's and early 20th Century. This land is steep, treed with redwoods and coastal oaks, very dense and rugged. Nothing in the way of logging, ranching or man made activity was happening or for that matter since the last logging in the 1920's. This was a place that maybe saw a handful of people a year.    We had pushed our bikes uphill for the last two hours and were riding downhill on a old fire road. We were going fast and quiet, when I slowed down for a muddy spot so as not to lose control, I noticed to my right just behind a redwood tree a figure that was about the same color of the tree bark, dark brown. It stepped from behind the tree and ran downhill. I stopped, dropped my bike and ran the twenty feet to the edge of the road, by this time it was running fast, with the unmistakeable sound of two feet treading on Tanbark Oak leaves. The creature was over six feet tall, and had the shape of a man.  I have camped in the area since this encounter and have heard a high pitch whistle sound and also a thumping of wood on wood more than once. Often, we had the sense of being watched, and left the area because of this feeling. ","In 1963 I rode a motorcycle at night near to my sighting. I stopped at Sand Point overlook and shut off the engine. A very strange noise came from the road just below the overlook where the road forks down to Hinkley Basin. It was a noise I have never heard before or since. Sort of a scream but different.  As it approached coming up the switchbacks, it got louder and it was beginning to cause me some alarm. After another rather close scream I quickly started the engine and left at full trottle.",There was one other witness a friend of mine riding behind on his bike. He got a quick look also.,,"Noon.

The area around my house is very densely wooded and my backyard is so forested that it's hard to see in the dark more than maybe 20 feet in.  As I was about to head back inside I heard what sounded like a person walking through the brush about 80 yards out. Because of the time, I was curious as to who was walking in my backyard and decided to stay silent and observe rather than calling out.  After a few moments of silence there was continued wrestling in the trees and what sounded like the snapping and breaking of branches. My dog started a low growl and the movement in the trees stopped. A few seconds later, there was a deep, loud growl in the trees. I told my dog to be quiet, but she barked at the noises causing the creature in the trees to start a progressive scream which at its peak was so loud I am sure it was not human.  I went back inside immediately, but my dog continued to growl at the noises for quite some time. I didn't have a view of the yard from my room because of a stairway in the way, but I continued to hear the creature vocalizing over the next ten minutes. I've heard the screams of mountain lions before, but never anything like this.","I looked around the area where I heard the noises this morning, but couldn't find any footprints.

Take the 4x4 trail for like half a mile until you reach the trailhead on the right.  That will lead you to Hobler Lake.",Shaver Lake,Highway 168,"I would like to start with my background as a backpacker and hunter.  I go to the Sierra Nevada Mountains about 1 and a half hours outside of Fresno, California.  Last summer around the time of the sighting, I made about 11 trips to numerous places. This is what I do.  I feel I have a good knowledge of the outdoors, and I have becomes quite at home in the wilderness.    On Friday, July 14, 2006 my friends, Jason and one other person who has asked me to exclude his name from this report, started out on a backpacking trip to Hobler Lake in the John Muir Wilderness. We started off our hike a little late in the day, about 5:00 pm, on the Maxsom trailhead, just on the east side of Courtright Reservoir.   We were hiking for about an hour, this being about 6:00 pm in the day.  It was dusk when we noticed something moving parallel to us in the woods.  It was hard to make out what it was because of the terrain consisting of dense wooded areas with evergreen trees.  It had a reddish brown color, and in the distance you could tell it was much bigger than a person was.  We assumed it was a black bear so we moved on.   Whatever it was seemed quite interested in us.  Every time we stopped, it would stop moving as well.  This continued for about an hour until it got too dark to see clearly without a flashlight.    We continued hiking to our destination for a while when I started hearing a crackling of branches to my left about 50 feet behind me, maybe less.  When I turned around, I saw a black outline of something looking at me from behind a tree.  I froze for a second because I was in such shock over what I was seeing.  Out of all the animals Ive seen at night in the mountains, this had no resemblance.  It was standing on two legs, was about 7 and one half feet tall, and was 4 feet wide at the shoulders.  It had hardly no neck, and very long arms that hung down by its mid legs.  It also had a fluffy appearance like it had a thick long coat of fur.    Then I whispered to my friend Jason to shine a flashlight on it.  As I said that, this thing must have heard me, because it turned around and started walking off somewhat fast.  At this time we decided to load our firearms, which werent much because all we had was a 40 caliber pistol and a 22 pistol.  For a time, whatever it was seemed to have left the area.    We arrived at Hobler Lake around 10:00 pm.  We set up our camp, cooked some food, and rested for a bit.  I finally fell asleep about 11:30 pm, but Jason and my other friend stayed up.    When I awoke in the morning, Jason told me that he and bob were by the lake having a cigarette when they heard large objects crashing in the water about 100 yards from them.  He described it a like something very large was jumping and thrashing in the water.    The next day we were staying close to camp because of all that went on.  We walked about away from camp to explore the area when we heard noise from camp like the clinking of pots and stuff.  We ran back to camp to find nothing out of place, but when looked closer some things were slightly moved, but not very far away from where we left them.

Keep following this road till you get to the signs saying keep out unless you have a permit to cut fire wood. Follow this road and the roads are many from their, then go North By North West several miles into the wilderness. ",French Gulch,French Gulch Road,"In early June 1991 French Gulch, CA. My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60's with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town.   I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone's with delicious pine nuts.   We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldnt see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped.   I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came.   Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the drivers side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, Dad, watch out !!. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to.   It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasnt a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didnt forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back.   We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, Oh dad it was probably just a bear.  We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wifes Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23.   I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didnt want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods.  Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadnt been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldnt have if I had known what I would have encountered that night.  Im very serious, because I've studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me.  I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I havent enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I've known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  Ive been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975. In all those years I have never had such a scare. My body and hands were trembling and I was scared down to the core of my being.  Sincerely,   Sgt. M.L.D. Ret, U.S. Army ","It was very secluded, and the time of month is important for the moon was half or near half.

My hunting partner and I were deer hunting near Heart Lake, which is located off the John Muir Trail behind Florence Lake.  We'd been back there for almost a week looking for the elusive Big Daddy Buck that we've hunted religiously for the last three years. We were high up on this ridge just before nightfall.  We were hiking back to our base camp and heard a loud bellowing howl that sent a shiver down our spines.  We looked at each other with confused looks on our faces, not knowing what that sound was.  We decided to hurry back to camp, but we heard another howl, but closer this time.  We saw Big Daddy Buck running down the opposite ridge side, and busting through brush, not caring if hunters spotted him.  Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope, I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush, like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child's footprint.  It was four times the size of mine.

A chase seemed to erupt and the sounds began retreating away from us.  It was not clear whether the coyotes were giving chase or being chased.

We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs.   One night when I was walking the dogs, one of them started growling and I listened closely and could hear the rustling of fallen leaves and the breaking of small branches. I shined my light right at where I heard the sounds. Now both of the dogs were growling and pulling at the leash trying to get at whatever was in the forest. I looked around closely with the flashlight and then I saw something. A huge figure about 200 feet away from me was watching me and the dogs. It was kind of swaying between the trees and just staring right at me and the dogs. It looked like a very tall ape, but it looked more built like a human.   I was scared stiff and I must have stood there for a minute or two holding the dogs back and staring at the creature when it turned around and started walking away. I then walked very fast back to the cabin watching the woods and not stopping for anything. I have never spoken of this incident with anyone before in my life and I have recently heard about this sight and thought it was finally time to talk about this with someone who would understand.

I have spent lots of time camping, hiking, fishing, and skiing in the Sierra backcountry.  I am familiar with many kinds of animal sounds and signs in the mountains.  Last weekend, we were camping at the Sawmill Walk-in Campground on the east side of Yosemite National Park.  After sunset as dusk was deepening, we were sitting around our camp table talking.  From the direction of the forests that line the canyon floor towards Mt. Conness in the west, a series of whoop-howls rang out from the distance and rolled down the canyon.  My sister was talking and immediately stopped, turned around, and said, ""What is that?!""  The calls continued for a few moments and then ceased.  They sounded most similar to the Snohomish and Puyallup calls on the BFRO website.  When the calls started, all other normal background wildlife noise stopped and didn't resume until several seconds after the calls ceased.  There were no answers to the original call, nor did it repeat.  That area of Yosemite is relatively deserted, and the Sawmill Walk-in Campground only has a few sites that are scattered widely.  The trail that runs through the campground eventually leads to the top of Mt. Conness and branches into the back country.

This was from perhaps 100 feet away, I quickly walked up to the stump, but there was no one there. It would have been possible to move uphill away from me using the large stump as cover, but only a very athletic person could have managed this in the time available.  Moving then uphill and to the SE, I regained the Bryan Meadow trail and there noted a large footprint, which I photographed next to my two-way radio. It is about twice the length of my foot, (a size 12 boot size). I do not know the source of this print, but it was where the rapid retreat occurred.  I had just parked at the Sierra Ski area (Short Stuff run), and begun walking up the forest north of the trail to Bryan Meadows.

06093,2973,21354,2005,Summer,August,CA,Siskiyou County,The Seiad Valley area of Highway 96!,Happy Camp,Highway 96,"I was traveling from San Francisco to visit my daughter, and since the coast was so foggy along highway 1, I went east from Eureka, Ca. to Willow Creek, Ca.  Since I did not want to travel south again to Redding we decided on highway 96 to Yreka, and I-5 as a shortcut.   My youngest daughter was with me, and we had driven a long ways and so we gassed up in Willow Creek and decided to continue to drive. It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this ""Bigfoot Highway 96, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so, and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph.   So, as I got to the ridge, maybe a couple miles from the bridge, I came around this last switchback, and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me.  If I didn't see it on the bank I probably would've hit it, because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight.   It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn't make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns.   I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here. I took a picture of the hillside he came down. I can find the exact spot and in fact am on vacation this next week and I got an infrared camera and a motor drive dslr this time, and oh, I ain't getting out of my car without my gun. Don't get me wrong I aint a gun freak but I could have rammed this thing with my car the first time. I don't want to hurt anything, but I don't want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either.   This sighting was at 12:55 am and I was wide awake. I checked my odometer from where I saw him it was forty two miles to the next bridge on the river at a small town before I got to the freeway on 96. I am a recreational hunter in my younger years but this isn't something you hunt; this is something you gawk at. Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn't glow. I must have counted 60 deer along that road and I saw eyeballs everywhere in the road along side the road from that ridge to Yreka. This thing didn't have glowing eyes, and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me. It didn't have animal eyes that glowed. It struck me that it was going to cross the road and go down to the river and was aware of its purpose like an intelligent being.  ",Nothing else unusual. I heard no sounds or smells. I read once where these things stink real bad. Well I rolled the windows down a little and stopped and smelled nothing like a Billy goat or anything like that. No strong odors or anything else unusual except the large deer population in the area. ,One other witness my 17 year old daughter.,"No but I live in central Washington at Moses Lake and I thought I could contact a ranger or that Bigfoot museum in Willow Springs, but was unable to link to anyone by phone or email.

Start looking for two old mine shafts...one on the right and the other on the left. You are now in the right area.",Green Valley,San Francisquito Canyon Rd.,"First, as a matter of background, I want to tell a little about myself. It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer.   That being said the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would ""buy into"" such a story, had he not been semi involved.   Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape.   In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called ""The old campground"" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs.   My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both.  The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then night fell.  As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. ""Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!""   Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable.   The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night!  The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again.  That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings.   The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig's chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, ""Do you see that? Are we seeing this?"" Craig said, What do we do? What should we do?"" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments.   Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. ""Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?"" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again.  The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped.   That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California.

This incident occured at the west end of sixth lake, with seven lake a short distance away.",Big Pine,Hwy 395,"When I was a young boy, my father would take me backpacking in the Sierra Nevada mountains every summer. When I was 10 years old, my father decided I was strong enough for a long excursion in the wilderness, and we set off for a place called Seven Lakes near Big Pine. We had hiked for a few days when we came to the sixth lake, and we could see the seventh lake just beyond it. Seventh lake was covered with ice and there was snow all around just past where we decided to camp for the night.   We thought this would be a good place to stay and explore the next day. During the night a snow storm hit and it became freezing cold, so my father and I put our sleeping bags over us and huddled together for warmth. I kept looking at my father's watch and hitting the light on it to see when we could expect the sun to rise so we could get warm. It was 3:45 a.m when we heard footsteps walking up the trail towards us. Our tent was right on the edge of the trail, and whatever was out there walking was on two feet and very big, we could almost feel the ground shake as it got closer. My father and I looked at eachother in silence, both of us a bit shocked by what we were hearing. It walked right up to our tent and stood there for about five minutes, completely silent.  I have very good senses and I could feel that whatever it was absolutely didn't want us there. I could feel its anger resonating, I can't explain how, but I got the most scary feeling in my heart. It wanted us to leave. Then it walked off just as suddenly as it came, but it headed in the direction of the frozen lake, and beyond that the trail went into very rugged wilderness. I didn't think it was a person because it had no flashlight, was very large, and only an idiot would continue walking on the trail into the wilderness at that time of night, in the middle of a snowstorm.  My father and I were quite frightened by our nightime visitor, and when first light hit we instantly broke camp and headed down the mountain without making breakfast, nor saying a word to eachother. We both knew we had to get out of there. Unfortunately, we were so far in the wilderness that we had to camp again that night further down the mountain, but this time we were not visited luckily.  My father has a MBA and is a successful businessman, very well liked and trusted in his community. To this day we still talk about the incident from time-to-time, and we still don't know what it was. At the time the incident happened, I was so scared I didn't even think to look for tracks, and I don't think I wanted to. We didn't notice a smell, but the direction of the wind was going from us towards the creature and I think that may be why we didn't smell it. We never actually saw it, but it sure didn't seem to be a man.","Nothing noteworthy other than the ""vibe"" the creature was giving. It was like nothing I've ever felt before.

At the north end of the Klamath National Forest. ,Orleans,Hwy 96,"I have two distinct incidences from 1997 and 1998 in the Klamath National Forest. The incident from 1997 was more of a Class B incident on the Klamath River directly off of Hwy 96. The incident in 1998 was during a solo backpacking trip in the Marble Mountain Wilderness where I hiked over 95 miles by myself.   In 1997, I was working in the field conducting a survey to the National Forest users about federal land issues. It was an internship, and my field partner and I spent almost every night outside. The night of the incident was late summer, the second week of August. We had conducted the survey at a fishing and camping campground on the Klamath River and decided to go find our own camp for the night. We chose an undeveloped site just downhill from Hwy 96 that had nice sand bars along the Klamath River adjacent to a parking and picnic area. The parking area was situated between the river and the Hwy and was downhill from the hwy. The road and the river run parallel to each other here. Ben, my field partner, parked the car, and we grabbed our sleeping bags and a few items and went to crash for the night on the sand bars. Late that night, probably around midnight, we woke up to a large creature walking, actually limping, like a step, drag of foot, step, drag of foot, along the hillside below the road and above the river and us. It sounded like Eigor, but was definitely a two legged creature. We thought it was a person. It was limping along this slope that was covered in about 12 inches of oak leaf duff and the drag of the second (possibly injured) foot was loud through these leaves. Ben asked me if I could hear it, or was I awake. I said yes. I jumped out of my sleeping bag and grabbed a light and a knife. I shined the light up to the hill but could see nothing, and the movement on the hill stopped when I shined the light. I sat in my bag firmly gripping the knife with the light off. It continued to walk along the hillside coming closer to us. Suddenly, it reached a point on the hill directly above us and let out a gnarling, gutteral yelp. Not a scream, but a cry for help. Over and over again, this gnarled inward drone was very loud and continuous. Honestly, Ben and I could see nothing, and just sat there frozen. Waiting. We must have sat there waiting for over an hour, and the creature did the same. It was about 30 feet up the hill from us. Again, in honesty, Ben and I were not scared, and somehow, we both fell asleep. I think I relaxed finally, and just waited, and somehow fell asleep. I awoke some 20 minutes later to a huge splash in the river directly below the sand bars we were sleeping on. Across the river, the next day we could see nothing. No tracks in the sand, no tracks in the leaves, no nothing. We both agreed that it was not a bear, not a cougar, not even a human. There was only one explanation and it was sasquatch.   In 1998, actually, I'm going to submit this one on the next one, because I think I'm close to 20 minutes. Sara ","The call for help or yelp seemed trustworthy. And it was not a human.

We were in shock.",Two witnesses; sleeping prior to and during/after,"Yes, in 1998 in the Marble Mountain WIlderness. I will report that separately, now in the next report. It's a long story.

06093,3010,22434,1998,Summer,August,CA,Siskiyou County,I can confirm the exact location at a later time when I access my map. ,Etna,Etna Summit Hwy 3,"In 1998, I was backpacking by myself in the Marble Mountain WIlderness in the Klamath National Forest the third week of August. The Klamath and the Marbles are particularly rugged and steep terrain.   I hiked from Etna Summit at the PCT trailhead and looped all the way through the Wooley Creek drainage, attempting to get to the Cal-Salmon River. My attempt failed and I hiked to Little Elk Lake and on out to the group of lakes outside of Lovers Camp trailhead for the full distance.   On day one I hiked over 14 miles on the PCT south from Etna SUmmit. On day two I left the PCT and hiked to a large marble outcropped ledge above the Wooley Creek drainage below a large, unnamed peak. (I can consult my map for a definite location, but do not have one available at this exact time). The night of my second day out, I slept on this nice marble ledge, beside a small creek about 2 feet wide that was more of an ice drainage from the steep, glacial peak above. This creek ran down the ledge and off a cliff that is about a 200 feet drop to a boulder field below and about 800 feet (or more) down to the Wooley Creek drainage. The 200 foot cliff below the ledge is VERY steep and to a tradational climber would be rated at least a 5.9 or 5.10 chaucy climb.    So, there I was, in my purple Marmot bag, all cozy and tucked in. The night was clear and was about 4 days before the full moon in late August, so it was bright. I was sleeping parallel to the little brook running along the Marble Ledge and about 15 feet from its banks. I fell asleep and woke up to a wierd noise that was very far away. I was already frightened of animals because I was by myself. It does not matter, but I am also female. I was scared out there by myself. But having the time of a life.   The noise so far away seemed to be way down in the forest in the Wooley Creek drainage. It was loud, however, almost like a yelling or a whooping. It was consistent and occured one yell after the other. I didn't worry too much, and was not concerned because it was so far away. The yelling truly happened one after the other. And, it was getting louder and perhaps closer. I still was not concerned as it was far enough and I was atop a huge cliff, so I felt safe and unreachable. However, the yelling got louder and closer yet, and started to travel up the boulder field below. At this point, I had heard the yelling for 20 minutes. Again, it was a consistent howl, or whoop, over and over again. I just laid still in my bag and realized that not only was this yelling thing was coming up the boulder field but coming up the cliff. Sure enough the creature was climbing up the cliff. AND FAST! The whole event was this thing running and hooting/inward drone yelling up the drainage, up and up to the cliff and beyond to the top of the peak. Sure enough when it got to the cliff it pulled and climbed itself up ""swiftly and agile"" as I put in my journal. It literally dyno'd every move on this 5.9 cliff and yanked itself up the cliff to the top where the ledge was, where I was. The creature, in the mean time, was still consistently calling/yelping/hooting. It got to the ledge and started running toward the peak above. As it got closer, I pretty much urinated in my sleeping bag. But I just laid still; I was extremely frightened. As it started to approach the ledge close to where I was, on the other side of the brook, I could see it. It was a silhouette of a huge running gorilla. It ran on two legs but dragged and pulled with its arms. It was huge. The arms were almost the length of half its body and was covered in hair. It was black, but I really only saw a silhouette. The head reminded me of the abominable snowman from the Christmas, Rudolph movie.   It just ran and howled, but then stopped slightly when it was parallel to me. It stopped howling, and slowed down slightly, and kind of hesitated. It turned its head toward me as if smelling something, but then immediately turned forward and really started running even faster. And louder and faster and then climbed up to the top of the peak and called and called for nearly four hours straight. Until almost sunrise. I stayed awake the whole time. I got up the next day and entered a short entry in my journal and packed up and continued on my journey. ",It was multiple hours of the calling. ,1- sleeping in the wilderness in a sleeping bag with no tent,"Similar sound and call the year earlier, but the creature was in distress the year earlier and the call was only for a few minutes.

Im with a paranormal invest group, earlier this monthwe went to Round Valley (Covelo) In calif. One of the investigations was a night time walk up a hill at a rancher's property in Covelo; earlier in the week, from what I remember hearing, was a Bigfoot had been interacting twice with his horses, which he chased off, so we hit that spot. Except me, I stayed in the car with a video game and a flashlight onhand. Maybe 10-15 mins after everyone else took off up the hill, I noticed a movement by the rear passenger window at the driver's side of the car, something a gold-tan color was standing by the back window. Turned off the interior light in the car and sat in the dark a little while, maybe 4-5 mins, then turned it back on. Whatever it was came back to the window again; this time I heard what I guess has to be described as 'patting/palming' the door of the car. I about lost it then, ( I dont scare, so this is really strange), and turned off the light, didnt turn it back on till everyone else came back down the hill. Just before people returned, I saw something run past the car really fast, up toward the front of the car line ( we had 4 cars there, I was in the last one). No one else saw the running whatever, they checked the door but didnt see any muddy handprints or anything on it. Im still frazzled, been dealing with all types of wild animals  since I was a kid ( aunt worked witha  zoo and Ive done wildlife rehab since I was a kid).

Distant was unavailble to us ,Inyokern Cailfornia,California Highway 14,"I lived in the High Desert of California in Ridgecrest, CA in Kern County from 1980 to 1985. I did a lot of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I never saw or heard anything unusual during that time. MY Mom, Sister (& Family), and Brother and his Family still live there.   My 19 year old son and I were visiting various family members from Sept 17 through Sept 27 2007 in Ridgecrest, CA. My sister took me and my son up to the Siebert family gold mine, cabin, and mining equipment on the 24th of September. We had spent about an hour at this location and we were preparing to leave.   My sister was in the Port-a-Potty and my son and I heard this high pitch scream like a woman hollering, and it sounded just like the ones we heard on your sight. Just like the sound that was reported in the BFRO Report # 9426 (Class B), which is only 7 miles from that site.   We yelled back thinking it was a woman in trouble and there was no reply. I asked my sister if she heard it she said no. I told her what we heard and she told me that she had horse backed and hiked through this area and had never heard anything that would make that kind of sound. She has lived and in this area since 1980. I asked her Husband whos an avid hunter, horseback trail rider and hiker in these mountains and he said that he knew of no animal that made a high pitch scream in this area. My brother- in-law also has lived in Ridgecrest, CA area all of his life.   In searching for the animal that made this sound on the internet, I found this site with the sound that I had heard.

06107,3028,22815,1986,Summer,July,CA,Tulare County,Take Sherman Pass Road past Kennedy Meadows General Store.  Continue on towards Troy Meadows. We turned on a vague dirt road within a mile of the entrance to Fish Creek Campground. Our camp was close to the old Jackass Trail connector.,Kennedy Meadows,Sherman Pass Road,"It was the summer of 1986 and I was camping with a friend in a small campsite where we had been several times before. It was a few hundred yards off the road before Fish Creek campground, near Troy Meadows area on the Kern Plateau, up the road from Kennedy Meadows. The public campground was about 1 ½ miles as the crow flies from us. I believe it was a Wednesday so there were not many other campers on the mountain, and we were on the first day of a motorcycle riding trip. We had spent the day gathering wood, setting up tents and testing out our old motorcycles. Two friends were to join us the next day.  As my friend Bob and I settled in around the campfire, we talked of the loop we were planning to ride the next day. We were camped in a clearing in the trees. There was a large meadow 100 yards on the other side of the trees. Bobs dog Duke, a large male Irish setter, was taking turns getting petted. It was getting late and we were winding down.   Just then we heard it. The sound was part yell, part growl. It was extremely loud and echoed through the valley. Only a very large pair of lungs could have produced the loud, high tones and deep throaty growl. This sound struck fear in me that I will never forget. It continued for several minutes and seemed to be at the edge of the meadow. It is hard to describe the intensity of the sound. The best I can do is to say that it started off sounding like the yell of a howler monkey, fading into the deep growl of an enraged grizzly bear.  We stoked up the fire without saying a word to each other. Next we heard a branch break just outside the light of the campfire. I looked at Duke and saw him staring at the area where I had heard the branch break. He was shaking from head to toe. Next we heard leaves move about fifty feet over from the last sound. The dog turned straight at it. Again, it was just out of the light of the fire. Bob and I were scared like never before. Our fear was emphasized by the fact that his large male dog was frozen in fear, fixed on one area in the darkness. By the look in his eyes, I believe he could see what we could not.   Several minutes later, the dog slowly broke his stare for a minute. Bob and I were able to talk after this point. All we could come up with to explain the noises was that it was large, not a bear, and very angry by the sound of it. We never calmed down that night. We abandoned the tents and both slept in Bobs Ford Bronco, Bob with his 357 lying across his chest. The next day, we waited until we heard other cars and far off bikes before we started really walking around. Later our friends arrived and we kept the camp loud all of the next night.   I have camped, hunted, fished and rode dirt bikes for my whole life. I have played it cool with bears outside my tent and seen a lot of the backcountry. I also work in the outdoors. I have never heard an animal like what we heard that one night.   ",,One witness and a dog.

I thought I was dreaming at first and then it repeated. I didn't want to wake my wife so I whispered her name and to my surprise she answered me by saying, ""That's Bigfoot, isn't it""? I kinda laughed and said ""I think it is"" we've both heard recordings of it on TV, but this was our first ""live"" experience. Not all recordings we've heard are the same as what we heard. This was a deep human/ape yell, and it lasted 4-6 seconds. Then a pause like it's filling its lungs and it would let it rip again.   As in other reports, I've been camping all my life and heard all kinds of animal sounds. When you hear this one, you know it's something different. Actually, it's beautiful in its own way. I listened to the same yell on the home page of this website just today. It was hard to determine how far off the yells were, but if I had to guess I would say maybe a mile?  About 10-15 minutes later we had an even better gift from the creature. Just up the hill from our campground we heard a loud bang. It was so loud, the only way I can describe it was that it sounded like a car drove into a tree. It was a very loud BOOM! Then one of the campers, who were camped at the base of the hill where the BOOM came from, said three words. I will not say what he said. They did make a fire and I'm sure they were scared. The next morning they were packed up and gone by the time I got up around 7.   The campground host had their lantern on when I got up to listen to the yells at 3 a.m. I think they heard the yells too. I asked them the next morning and they said it might have been sirens. I could tell that she was trying to keep it quiet. She doesn't want folks to be scared to camp, or maybe she just didn't want to believe it herself.   The next morning I took a drive across the Hwy 36 from the campground with my boy. We went on a dirt road just for fun to look at the terrain while my wife fixed breakfast with my daughter. The dirt road we were on was numbered 31N17, and we only went up a few miles and headed back to camp.   But it was up in those mountains off that dirt road somewhere, where the yells came from. The BANG was in our campground so it, Bigfoot, had to have crossed Hwy 36 to get on our side.

06051,3074,23319,1995,Summer,,CA,Mono County,"After some questioning, it was determined that these two hunters went north from Bishop, Ca. on Hwy. 6, and then went a short ways west on Hwy. 120. There they reached a very small town site, determined to be Benton Hot Springs, where there they went south a little ways.","Benton, CA",Hyw. 120,"When I was very young I saw a pair of Bigfoot tracks with my father. Im guessing I was about 9 years old. Im now 22. My father and I used to go rabbit hunting all the time. We always went to the same place and always saw dozens and dozens of rabbits.   We would get up very early in the morning, about 1AM, so that we could get out to our spot about an hour before dawn. So it was a few hours outside of Bishop, CA. We would make sure to get there early so that we could sit in the car and wait for dawn to come.   Just as the sun would start to rise and there was enough light to see we would normally see tons of rabbits running about, but that day was different. There was not a single rabbit in sight. That had never happened before. We stayed in the truck and waited until the sun was fully up before we decided to get out and take a stroll around to see if there was anything to see. Just before we left the truck my dad asked me if I wanted to bring the camera and I told him ""Na, we arent going to see anything out here."" Ha-ha! Boy was I mistaken.   We took off from the truck and went into the wilderness. There was nothing to see at all. No animals anywhere. We were walking along and suddenly we came upon the giant footprints in the sand. There were two sets of prints, one right next to the other. They were barefoot and looked just like human feet. Right away we knew what they were. Its a natural thing that goes through your mind. When you see them you say yourself, ""Those are bigfoot tracks.""   The first sets of tracks were HUGE, and thee times as big as my fathers feet, and he is about 6' 3"" with a good sized foot. (He is very thin though). The second set of footprints was the same size as mine. Right next to its parents tracks. The tracks dug deep into the ground and my father and I talked about that. We tried to stomp on the ground to see if we make an indention as deep as theirs but we couldnt, even with our shoes on.   We followed the tracks and we came to a barbwire fence. On the other side was a paved road. On the other side of the road was a hill that went up and overlooked a valley. I was too young to notice anything about how the tracks crossed the fence and got to the road or if there was a piece of fur on the barbs, so Im sorry that I couldnt tell you anymore about that. On the other side of the road there were no tracks and we couldnt find any more around.   My father decided that we needed the camera, so I stayed at the fence while he went back the way we came to get back to the truck. It seemed like it took forever for him to return and being a little kid I was getting a little scared. But, he finally came back and told me that he could not find the truck! So when we were done looking around we took the road that we had found to see where it would lead us. It took us to a small town that we had passed to get to our spot. So we knew where we were form there and were able to finally get back to our truck and once we were there we decided we had gotten enough walking done for the day so we headed home.   ","What was interesting about the tracks that we saw was that when we followed them they stopped at a road. At first thought that would be because someone had made the footprints and then hopped in their car and left. But, on second thought, if someone was making this scene they would want to make sure people were going to see it and would make the tracks much closer to town. Why would someone make fake tracks on the hopes that someone MIGHT see it? When they could make them somewhere that the KNEW people would see it. But anyways, since the tracks did not continue to the other side bigfoot and his kin may have taken the road.",My father was the second witness. ,None.,Early morning.

There were many caves in the cliffs, the top of the cliff was about probably 8,000 ft, I was around 7,400 ft.

Unclear on the exact location; however, that should be easy to ascertain from the terrain captured on the video tape.",Lee Vining,Hwy 395,"On May 18, 1991, while on vacation in the Mammoth Lakes area in Northern California, my family took a short day hike to Mono Lake to do some sightseeing. It was overcast and very cold with a strong wind blowing. There was still snow on the surrounding peaks. Mono Lake is at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains.   I do not recall the location at which we parked the car to begin our hike, but I do remember that ours was the only car in the parking area and that the spot was quite desolate. It was a cold Saturday morning and the area was deserted. At 9:17AM I began shooting VHS video footage of our trek, and after a short period of time we finally decided to leave because of the wind and cold. We went back to our hotel in June Lake, enjoyed the rest of the weekend and went home. The trip was quite uneventful (or so we assumed).  The tape went into our family home video collection and for 17 years, from 1991 to 2008, it has been watched countless times by family and friends. So much so that my kids have the dialog on much of the tape collection memorized. On April 19, 2008 my daughter (6 years old in the video and now 22) was watching the tape in the downstairs family room when she suddenly screamed out and began yelling for me to come downstairs. I thought something bad had happened and after racing down the staircase, found my daughter and my ex sitting in front of the television telling me to watch a segment from the tape. What I saw when we played it back made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. And it was something none of us had ever noticed in almost 17 years of watching this tape,  In the final few seconds of the Mono Lake segment just before I turned the camera off I caught something very large and black moving between two rock formations a short distance from where we had been hiking. It was completely black with no differentiation in color or texture and walked upright like a human but with a gate more like a primate. At first I thought it was a bear, but after going over the video many times and finally digitizing and sharpening it I am now unsure what to think. From examination of the footage of my family whose distance from the camera was comparable to that of the creature it is easy to see the distinct details and variation in clothing, hair, face and hands. In contrast, the creature caught on tape exhibits none of those distinctions.The shape of the body does not resemble a human. The head is too large and the arms are too long. And although it does resemble a bear at one particular angle in the clip, the stance and gate don't add up. It is an intriguing mystery.  That we were able to go for 17 years without noticing this event on the tape seems unbelievable, but in retrospect it actually makes some sense. The segment lasts for only a couple of seconds and the focus is on the lake and mountains which is what I must have been filming at the time. I didn't see it when I shot the tape and it has since gone unnoticed because one must really be looking for it to see it.  I am not a person who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories, alien abductions and bizarre events such as a purported Bigfoot sighting. I've seen various footage and photographs of Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings over the years and have always been extremely skeptical of their authenticity. As an engineer who now teaches high school physics, I am highly educated and very level headed. If I see something I don't understand my natural reaction is to analyze it rationally using the scientific method. I do not jump to conclusions based on faulty hypotheses. So in this case, I will suspend judgment pursuant to further investigation. But having shown this video to family and friends whose opinions I trust, the overall reaction seems to be a unanimous ""Bigfoot!!"" Wishful thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way it is very intriguing and definitely warrants further investigation.  Your opinion and assistance in this matter would be appreciated.

I thought I was the only one awake at the time but when I turned my head to look at my wife, her eyes were wide open. She turned her head to look at me and we both had that ""yep, that's what it is"" look. She was kind of freaked out about it but I was rather excited as I have been interested in seeing or hearing some kind of bigfoot evidence. The sound came from the northern direction which was upstream from us. It sounded as if it was kind of far and had a slight echo to it. It was very similar to other scream recordings that my wife and I have heard.",Both incidents happened only on the first morning of the trip.,2.

Plus, I had lived in Mountain Center a few miles north of Hemet Lake, so I was pretty familiar with the area and its wild life inhabitants. I've been Hiking, fishing, hunting, rock hounding, and Prospecting in just about all of California for the last 20 years, from the Cascades to Azusa Canyon.   On one of the nights, I think it was the 16th of November; we wanted to go on a night walk around Hemet Lake since the whole city of Idyllwild goes to bed at 8pm and it was about 10:30 at night, so we drove the 8 mile drive from our hotel to the lake. We arrived at the lake at about 11pm and sat on the car next to some big green trash bins about 150 feet or so from the lake; when we heard something 400 feet or so breaking branches in a canyon to our backs. It sounded big and didn't seem to care if it was heard coming down the slope, so I assumed it was just a big black bear until the smell. The only way I could describe it was a dying wet dog.   A feeling of discomfort came over us both as we saw nor heard any more of what we assumed to be a big black bear coming down the canyon, meaning whatever came down the canyon was hiding in the tree line 300 feet or so away from where we sat. I got a chill up my spine and had that feeling that we shouldn't be here right now. We got in the car and left to come back just under a hour later hoping what ever it was would be gone, so we could try to finally go on our late night lake walk.   We pulled up and backed into to the same spot as before to notice that one of the green trash bins had been pushed over towards the lake, and that there was a 2 foot wide 4 inch deep circular dent like something big had punched it. There was no paint smear like a car had hit it. It was and had been dead quite other than the unknown thing that came down the canyon about an hour before.   I had no idea what could have done that to a big steel trash bin and for years until Google Earth Mapping of Bigfoot. I saw that there had been sightings, calls, and smells reported in the surrounding area, and came to the conclusion that might make more sense being a believer in crypto zoology.

At grandpa's request, we wish to keep the actual number to ourselves, however, I am happy to take you there if you want.  Scratch that.  My braver husband can take you there.  ","Dorrington, CA","Forest Road 6N08, HWY 4","Okay, I just spent about ten or fifteen minutes listening to the various sounds and recordings that you have to try to help me identify what we heard. I cannot say that any of the recordings sounded just like what we heard, however it sounded similar to many of them.   My family (husband and two kids) went up to Big Prather Meadows, straight up from Dorrington, California. My husband's grandpa has a small cabin in the meadow, and we go there when we can, generally in the summer. I made the mistake of reading a bunch of your stuff prior to the trip, and I admit that I was on ""high alert"" that first night. However, around 2:30 or so in the morning of Friday, July 25th, 2008 (just three days ago), I heard some kind of vocalization that was not familiar to me.  I was not happy to hear this, honestly. I suppose I ought to be since I have held an avid interest in this subject for years, but there is a whacking big difference between sitting safely in your home reading about this stuff on the net, and listening to something make funky noises in the dark woods of a forest. As my best friend said, ""I used to really like the cabin..."" I got out of the tent to wake up my husband, who was sleeping on the ground by the unused fire pit. We both sat and listened to the sounds for about an hour and a half, or so.   To the best of my ability, this is what we heard: Loud, clear, not-shrill sounding (to me, the Puyallup calls sound somewhat metallic and shrill), medium-range, and smooth sounds. They began lower in pitch and would rise smoothly to end at a higher pitch, but not like the whoops that you have recorded. These didn't have that ""lilt"" at the end. It was just a smooth ascent from low range up to a higher range.   There was another call that sounded like what a contraction looks like. (Forgive me, I'm not sure how to describe it but it made me think of what my contractions looked like on paper when birthing my kids), beginning low, smoothly rising up to a higher level, and then smoothly descending down again.   There was also a kind of a hiccup sort of sound that would directly follow some of the calls, but I was literally shaking and too freaked out about it to really pay attention to what kind of call it followed: the upswing, or the contraction call.   Anyhow, as I said, this went on for over an hour with the two of us listening. Sometimes it would sound like it was moving near to us. Other times it sounded further away. I am not sure if there were two animals, thus accounting for the near/far sounds, or one. If it was two animals, they sounded identical to me.  After this happened, we both tried to explain how big/far the sounds were to us. We both agree that it sounded somewhat distant, but find it hard to tell since sound might carry really well in a dead-silent forest. We agree that it sounded to be between a half a mile and a mile away. We also agree that it was a large sound. Whatever made it sounded effortless on its part, but was a very large sound. We believe that it is a sound of ""size"" similar to, say a very loud moo of a cow across a field. I'm digging here because I've never had any experience like it so I don't have much I can truly compare it to.  I grew up in Washington State, west side. I'm a Biology minor with a Life Science teaching credential, so I am familiar, at least, with what wildlife looks like and sounds like in videos, if not in person. But most of my personal encounters with wildlife have been animals of the smaller variety: coyote yips and howls things like that. I've only heard larger animals on wildlife programs and I am holding out the hope that one of your specialists will call me back and explain that what we heard was just a ""such and such"" and often is confused with a Big Foot call. I'd be able to enjoy the cabin a lot more if you could do so. But, I know you won't, because this was a very strange sound, and even my mathematician-husband, who is grounded in science and wasn't afraid like I was, stated that it sure was loud, and that it wasn't like anything he'd ever heard before. It sounded like an animal, but it also sounded enough like a person to think it could have been a joke, but not exactly. I do not think I could replicate the sound.  ","Absolutely ZERO sound heard before. No wind, no crickets, no nothing. Just total silence. But I believe it is generally very quiet at night there. Also, we noted a large pile of scat behind the cabin and figured it was a bear.  However, I have never seen bear poop in the wild, and have no idea what it looks like.  It was bigger than what a person would leave, and had tons more roughage in it; it was very dark brown and fibrous.  No prints though.  My husband is rather adamant that it is bear poop.  Probably is. But I wanted to cover my bases here.","I was reading a book sometime before and couldn't sleep.  I heard it first.  I then proceeded to wake my husband up, who was sleeping soundly outdoors.  He then sat up and listened with me for at least a half an hour before he fell back asleep. I continued to listen until it stopped, and had it gotten any closer, had planned on grabbing my kids and heading into the cabin, upstairs, and pulling the ladder up with us!   I'm betting I would have made my husband come too. ","Only the ones I have read on your website that are nearby, the closes being the one at the lake in that area with the mother and son.  I don't recall names or date.  ","2:30 (or perhaps slightly later on as my husband discovered his watch was slow the next day), absolute still, no wind, no sound.

Lots of mountainous areas around us, with steep ridges and hills.  No real landmarks or structures noted other than the few cabins in the association that dot the area.

I never heard anything so awful in all of my life.  In my life time I never heard a wild animal that could make an awful sound like that.   Ive heard through the years about this big foot stuff, and Im not sure what this thing was, but while I was at the window looking I could hear foot steps in the leaves.  It made the sound three times, so I made a mad cat fighting sound, and it was then that I heard the foot steps leave my yard and I know that it was human steps and not animal sounding steps.   I went back to bed, but I could not forget that sound. A friend called the next day and I was telling them about it.  He told me there was some guys on the news who had found a dead big foot back east.  He told me to go to your web site for pictures, so I did for fun.  I looked at all of the pictures and listened to the different sounds, and when I got to the last sounds on your site page, I freaked out, because that was the same sound that I heard that morning.  The next night it was back again, but this time I saw out my window this hairy thing which was very-very tall. I have been freaked out ever since, and I cant sleep, because this thing is very upsetting.  ","I felt it was very strange that it would come back a second night.

We drove all the way up to the top of the Sonora pass about a mile or so past the Kennedy Meadows area we pulled off the road toward the left. We drove down about 200 yards into a flat area between two mountains and set up camp. We got there about 6:30pm. We were there for about an hour and a half. To be more specific of the time, it was just beginning to get dark or dusky. We had already scouted out the area and had just returned to the camp when all five of us heard a very loud crashing noise. At first I thought it was a tree falling but then I immediately saw a fast moving object running down the ravine which was about fifty yards away from our camp. I then thought it must be a deer but then is when I saw it at it's closest position to me running in an upright position across the large granite rocks that lay in the ravine. My judgment  was very clear at the time of the sighting and so what I think it was is a very intelligent creature with tremendous speed and strength running like a man and covered in dark hair from head to toe. Lying across ways of the ravine were many fallen trees and so this creature was breaking the branches of these trees while running as fast as a deer would be seen running.

My wife and I shared a campsite and our friends shared a campsite, with 2 tents, on a second campsite about 50ft. away from us. I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly.  I awoke at 4:50am. Just as I awoke, I heard a loud sound that seemed to me to be someone hitting a treetrunk with a large branch. I lifted my head in the tent and looked around for any light sources and saw none. I also heard no voices. I was intrigued enough to continue listening. Our closest neighbor had a Dachsund and the next closest had two larger dogs that were tied up outside their tent. Once I heard the first loud sound the outside dogs started moving around but didn't bark. They made some moaning sounds but that's all.  From what I could tell, as far as sounds, something or someone walked through the campground from lower to higher through a ravine. It had very heavy footsteps. It sounded like it broke fairly large branches on the ground. Once it crossed the campground's asphalt, the neighboring dogs started crying, whimpering and moaning. I then heard what sounded like a rock or something similar, being thrown against a tree near our tent and falling to the ground. Right at the crescendo of the crunching branches I decided to get up and unzip our tent window and at the same time the tent of the owners of the dogs opened and a woman came out and grabbed the dogs to quiet them down. That was the last I heard of the crunching, footstep sounds. Also, there had been crickets making noise all night until this event. Once this started, the cricket noise reduced to only crickets at a great distance. By the end of the incident there were no forest sounds at all.  The next morning, we walked over to the ravine that I thought I had heard the biped walking through and found no footprints due to the extremely dry ground. I spoke to a family right next to the ravine and they had heard nothing that night but had heard footsteps the night before. The husband/father is a hunter and told me that he had seen bears 2 or 3 times in the past in those mountains but had never seen them down in the campgrounds in that area.  Mountain lions are fairly common in those mountains, but what I heard seemed to be heavier than a mountain lion. Plus, whatever animal I heard sounded like it had two feet as opposed to four.  I later found out that one of our friends had heard footsteps around his tent at about 4am.

06111,3227,24648,1964,Summer,August,CA,Ventura County,Pine Mountain campground.,"Ojai, Ca.",Highway 33,"An unknown ape-like creature walked upright out of the thick patch of bushes and stood looking, for several seconds, up and down the fire lane.  I cocked the hammer back on the .32 caliber carbine, shouldered the weapon, and began to press the trigger.  Something in my mind ordered me to not shoot the creature!  I call it Devine intervention.       I asked myself if this was a bear?  No, I instantly decided that it didnt look like a bear because there was not a long, protruding snout jutting out from the face.  Besides, bears were not legal game in this area of California.  It certainly was not a buck, never mind the fact that if it was a deer there were no horns on this animal.  I immediately told myself it looked like a monkey man.           I can hear myself today saying these words out loud:  What the hell is a monkey doing out here in the mountains?  In the meantime, as I made the move to shoulder the carbine, and spoke those words, the big animal turned towards me from the waste up.        Looking over the sights of the little carbine, I observed this being to be about 7 or 8 feet tall, with well-muscled, long hairy arms hanging down to the waist. The hands looked almost human; I remember noticing these things as I slowly put down the gun.         This creature was completely covered in long dark, brown hair, from head to feet and appeared to have a huge, barrel chest.  Some other striking features that I noticed were a flat, square jawed face; a flat, dark looking nose; no noticeable hair on the face; and a sloping fore head.  I dont remember seeing any sign of ears on the animal  too much long hair around the side of the head  and there was no discernable neck.         Since I had no idea what this creature was, Ive always been glad to have instantly decided NOT TO SHOOT IT!  Thank God for protective Angles?  The other thing I thought about, at the time, was this could be some idiot in a monkey suit playing a prank on some hunter like me.  But, then, only a village idiot would dress up in a monkey costume and roam around the mountains during deer hunting season.           As I contemplate the incident today, I realize now that this was a Bigfoot!  And, it had both seen and heard me.  I could not tell what sex it was because of all the long, dark hair around the body.  However, now that I have seen numerous showings of the Patterson film in which Pattie was documented, I must guesstimate it was male in gender?           Within 10-15 seconds, as quickly as the creature had entered my field of view, it calmly made about two strides across the open fire lane, parted some tall bushes with well-muscled, uplifted hairy arms, and disappeared into the thick bushes.         Right away I noticed that it was now standing inside the screen of thick brush along side of the fire land like it was watching me.  I could readily discern the huge dark shape, as it stood there for possibly a minute or so.  Apparently, it was looking at me sitting up the hill on the ground.  I didnt know at the time whether it was going to attack me or leave.  I kept the little carbine in the ready position across my chest and slowly stood up to get a better look at this unknown animal.         I decided at the moment when I stood up that, that if this thing would charge me, I was going to run back up the hill to my dad - unless it got too close to me.  Then, and only then, would I consider shooting the animal!  I admit it  I was scared fit to wet my pants.  I now recall seeing the bushes shake violently and the dark shape stepped out of sight.             I slowly sat down again and listened to its rustling footsteps as the huge ape-man descended down the hill away from me.  Boy was I glad it was gone.  Now the shakes started.  If I had been smoking in those days, I would have lit a cigarette and probably smoked the whole pack.          Finally, after about 15-minutes, when the stillness was broken by singing birds and scurrying chipmunks, I got up enough nerve to carefully go down to the spot where I had seen this creature.  Was I dreaming?  No, because there, in the loose dirt, I saw a couple of huge, human-like, barefooted tracks where it had crossed the fire line.         Then, a raunchy odor hit my nose.  I remember thinking it smelled like a horrendous fart.  In fact, at the time, I decided to call it the Fart Creature.  I know, that is not a very endearing name for such a marvelous being, but thats how my scared brain was working that fateful morning.         Deciding that now would be a good time to leave the area; I quickly walked back up the hill to where I had been sitting and stood there for a few minutes.  Clearly, I had seen something unexplained.  Now I had to decide if I should tell my dad or just keep quiet.  To tell you the truth, I was afraid to tell my father because I knew he would never believe me.  I thought he would most certainly take my hunting privileges away for seeing buggers in the hills.         I began slowly walking back up the firebreak towards my father in the piney flats above me.  I remember now that he had asked me why I had left my deer stand so early.  I think I replied that I was hungry and bored at not seeing a buck right after daylight.  He probably chewed me out for leaving so early, but, at least, I didnt incur his wrath for telling a bugger story!         Honestly, for many years I forgot about this incident.  I had to go back to military school the next week and the ensuing years later my life was filled with other things.  Of course, I really never did totally forget about seeing a Sasquatch!  It was only later on in life, after getting married, serving in the military, and leaving California for Florida, that this sighting began to trouble my conscious.         How I kept this a secret for this many years I will never know.  I guess I was frightened that people would think I was crazy?  Usually, Im the blabby type, sharing plenty of secrets with almost anybody, especially family or friends.  But this deal, oh no  I kept these cards close  too close for too long, really!    I swear to all persons reading this report that the facts documented here are recalled to the best of my ability after 44 years and one month in the past!   			____________R.R.R._____________                                               Friday, September 12, 2008    p.s.

06051,3241,24743,2007,Fall,October,CA,Mono County,Lundy Lake area,Lee Vining,US 395,"I have spoken verbally with an investigator about this incident, but never filled out a report. The more I think about it, the more relevant it seems. So this is my report:  I had been camping on family property for two days waiting for others to arrive. This property once had a cabin on it that was destroyed in the late sixties by an avalanche, but the concrete slab is still there, and we park RV's on it.  I had been sitting in a folding chair reading for a couple of hours when I heard a very large branch snap. It was loud like a gunshot, or at least seemed that way with all of the quiet. Immediately after the snap there was a commotion as some of my nearby items (gas cans and trailer dolly) fell from their spot behind an old wooden shed about 35 feet from me, and something very large moved through the trees for about 30 feet and stopped.  As soon as the branch snapped, I shot out of my chair and then heard the rest of the commotion. It really scared me, and I looked around for the dogs. They were cowering at the door to the trailer, which is strange because they usually go after anything out there. I wanted in the trailer just as bad as they did. As I approached the door, I got the feeling that the animal in question was a short distance away watching. It was very unnerving. We went in and locked the door.","Several things have prompted me to fill out this report: First, the resort had closed early for the year and other than 2 or 3 people working at the resort tying up loose ends, I was alone in the canyon.  Second, the dogs ALWAYS go after critters and deer, but not this time.  Third, the animal only moved off a short distance and stopped. Lastly, this animal had somehow managed to get within 35 feet of me without being heard. Bears are not stealthy, in my experience. It sounded much larger than a deer as it crashed through the trees. I had been sitting there for quite a while when it happened and had not heard a thing until the branch snapped. Also, I never looked for the broken branch, but it sounded very large when it broke.

Deep whooping was projecting from the southwest, with answers coming from the south/southeast. The answer calls came in higher pitches and might have been coming from two different animals. The whoops could at times be described as moaning and other inflected noises I can't really describe with words.  The exchange lasted for about 30 minutes.

06107,3262,24877,2008,Summer,September,CA,Tulare County,The area is located south of the Sherman Pass Road about a one hour drive out of Kernville. The track area is located approximately 6 miles south of Sherman Peak.,Kernville,Sherman Pass Road,"September 29, 2008 Im in the mountains above Kernville for opening weekend deer hunting season. I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning. I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark. I pitched my tent on a ridge just down from a high mountain pass.   Just before going to sleep I was standing outside my tent and I heard a loud noise behind me. The noise was within forty feet of my position, and I would describe it as a single pop sound. Ill try to spell out the sound, but there is no way I can reproduce the sound! Pooeekk. It could have been a branch being broken off of a tree but it would have had to come off at the base of the branch where it meets the tree trunk. The tree would have to be slightly hollow to get the sound.   There was no noise after the initial sound and nothing ever hit the ground. My first impression of the sound was that it was a warning and I thought it was more of an animal sound, because it had a hollow guttural tone to the pop sound. I dismissed the occurrence and had no other problems through the night.   The next morning I got up before sun up and started stocking along the tree line heading toward the mountain pass. After about 75 yards I moved into the trees and sat for some time looking over a meadow. Once I finished my time there I walked in the trees for twenty feet and then I moved out of the trees and back in the open.   Just as I stepped out of the trees I spotted a large foot print. It was very large and I could make out two toes at the top left of the print. At this point I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the foot print. The foot print was as long as my boot, 13 long plus the toes and 2 wider than my boot on the side. I could make out a ridge in the dirt where the ball of the heal and the middle of the foot come together.   After taking the picture I resumed my hunting and I moved along the tree line following the foot prints. They were made by a man like biped creature, the stride was longer than mine are, but I could stretch my stride to match the stride. I followed the prints for about another 75 yards they went right through the middle of the saddle between the two mountains.   At that point I resumed my hunting for deer and dismissed the Bigfoot. The only thing I would add about the prints they were all the same, but I could only see the toes on the first print because that print went slightly into the side of the mound. I will send a copy of the picture once you make contact with me. Both the toes and skin fold mound can be seen in the digital picture. ","The only thing I can say that is more of a question than anything. I seen one pile of fecal matter on top of the mountain that did not match the other bear droppings I had seen. The bear piles were full of berry seeds, this one was grass with pine needles in it. I have never seen any animal that eats pine needles? The one reason I mention this is because I seen another dropping like this the next day at another location. This one was very large 13 long and 3 in diameter. In this area I noticed a distinctive marker of stacked rocks. ",No,No,"Sound was at dark 8:00 PM, Foot print 7:00 AM.","Pine forest, mountain peak, open meadow.",29

This was our second night at this campground. We were camped at site 401, way back in the isolated section of the campground, far from anyone. I had just finished cooking our supper on the portable propane barbeque pit, which was located on the picnic table. We both went inside to eat.   During the time I was cooking, I set up a camp fire, but didn't light it yet. After we finished eating, I started the campfire. After the fire was burning for about 15 minutes, I kicked it into the fire pit from the grate. At that time my wife got a very strong feeling that we were being watched from behind our camper.   She said it seemed to move (the feeling) from behind the trailer, from one end to the other. There were trees, and dense foliage behind the trailer. I started to look around with a flash light to see what it was, and after not finding anything, I started the car and plugged in the 12v spot light.   Looking around for about 5 minutes, I thought I saw something move in the distance, behind a tree. This was in the opposite area from the trailer, where no one was camped at all. We both were shaken up, and went inside the trailer for the night. After 10 minutes my wife heard 2 whoops, coming from the area that I thought I saw something move at. She was in bed lying next to the window. I didn't hear the sound.   One more thing to add, is that the night before we heard dogs bark in the distance, this night it was all quiet no dogs at all.

I looked in the direction they were barking and standing in a suger beet field thirty to forty feet away was a humanoid figure covered in long shaggy grey hair.  This thing was massive and I would imagine it was at least eight feet tall.  It didn't move - it just stood there looking at us.

Very remote, hills, wooded ravines with creeks and stream bottoms.","North of Cloverdale, California",Hwy 128 (Oat Valley Rd),"I am a law enforcement officer. I have no reason to lie about what I saw and frankly I don't care if anyone believes me. I have heard of these kind of things here and there but never paid close attention to it or laughed it off.  It's not that I didn't believe, I'd just believe it when I saw it.   It was a very warm, almost hot evening just after or before labor day in 2007. It was dark, around 8:30 or 9:00 PM but the sky was still a little lit up in the West that time of year.  I was on patrol, driving W/B on Hwy 128 out of Cloverdale going to an alarm call out at some ranch property.  Those calls are very common.  As a law enforcement officer, you notice things out of place.  A car here that wasn't parked there yesterday, a person walking along the road in a desolate area, lights on in a closed business....things like that. Things just catch your eye that other people don't notice. Like I said, I was driving W/B and saw someone coming up out of the ravine onto the roadside. I can't describe it...I just saw the movement in the brush and knew it was someone.  People run from us all the time and I thought I may have surprised someone who might be growing marijuana in the woods or something like that. It happens a lot here.  I saw the outline of a body, the reflection of my headlights in it's eyes and it ducked back into the scrub brush before I passed it.    Thinking it was someone trying to avoid or hide from me, I hit the brakes and backed up quickly.  That's when I saw it in my headlight beams.  It was about 6-7 ft tall, thick matted brown fur and walking upright. I did not see the face, it was walking away from me but slowly.  Like everyone else says, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was definitely something I was not gonna put out on the radio. There were a lot of branches and overgrowth in the way, but there was no mistake on what I saw.   I specifically remember two things.  One was that it had small leaves and grass matted into its fur all over its back. I saw that as it walked away from me.  I remember that vividly. Second, I remember that it used slow, deliberate movements.  It walked away and used its arm to swipe small limbs and twigs out of its way.  I saw it from the backside for a good 4-5 seconds before it disappeared into the overgrowth again.  I then got out of my car and stood there for about 2-3 minutes with the engine off.  I could hear the same slow movements and crunching of leaves and sticks for a while. I could hear it down there making its way into the creek area.  Everytime I stopped hearing it and would start to walk back to my car, I'd hear a ""Crunch"" in the distance and I'd listen a bit longer.   There is a creek down in that ravine which is probably where it went back to.   Needless to say, I told no one.  This wasn't something to bring up in briefing or to put in the patrol blotter. That would make for an extremely long and uncomfortable career for anyone.    A friend of mine from back East told me about this website.  I didn't know who else to contact. I almost contacted one of our Fish & Game Officers up here but he knew too many of my friends, so I just kept it quiet. I read a lot of other postings on here and it's nice to know I'm not alone. I've never seen a ghost, UFO or anything like that, but this really makes me wonder now what else is out there that we laugh off from time to time.

This is where the biped 'creature' was running in the same direction as we were driving, but on the other side of the road.

Two of us were driving home from a day of skiing at Mammoth Mountain California. The road was a two lane highway (opposite directions) with a soft dirt shoulder. We were in an open convertible (because the skis did not fit otherwise).   The moon was full and the lighting was un-obscured and visibility was (near daylight) excellent. In the distance (well beyond the reach of the High beamed head lights) two of us could see a very large and (completely out of place) thing running ahead of our approaching car. It was on the other side of the road. We slowed, 50, 40,30mph... now in our headlights. Running on the dirt shoulder, obviously unaware of our approaching auto... There it was ""Bigfoot""! At its closest point we were 10 UNOBSTRUCTED FEET FROM IT! EYE TO EYE! "," Perhaps, the most ""burnt in"" recollection of the sighting was the look of absolute surprise on the creature...We were close enough to SEE (and almost SENSE how very startled it was by us being suddenly eye-to-eye with us.   This was not some lower animal response. This was an intelligent human like, 'Oh crap- you saw me and where did you come from' look of surprise, as it stared at us just prior to running down and off the elevated highway.  The creature was SIGNIFICANTLY larger than even the largest of human beings (NO WAY THIS WAS A HUMAN BEING DRESSED IN COSTUME AS ""BIGFOOT"").   While, we were sitting in an auto, I can still say, with a high degree of accuracy, that the creature was eight to nine feet tall. The body mass was stout, thick in the chest/trunk, and very muscular. Even though 90% hair covered, you could see outline of significant ""muscle definition and mass"". This is much better than a guess; it weighed upwards of 500-600 lbs.   I can remember many details of creature: hair 90%, dirty skin tone, where there was leathery skin 10%, arm length, relative appendage size, and the biometrics of the approximate 15 mph running gate...Even the highly expression (because of the surprise) on its eyes...   The other witness, I am quite certain, will have an equally vivid recollection. "," Two witnesses. Me, the driver (it was my turn at the wheel) of the small convertible and the owner passenger. Both were 19 year old males, and old friends. The top was down, even though winter, because we had skies in the car. This had been a non-drinking day of skiing for us. The car was a little Fiat with a great heater and wind deflection design.  We were driving on the Highway......","Just for the record, I am readily willing to submit to a lie detector and/or regression hypnosis. I suspect the second witness would do so as well.","A full moon, cold and absolutely clear, and the time of night was between 8 & 9:00pm. The light of the intense full moon gave the crispness and brightness of ""twilight"".  We had excellent visual clarity of the surrounding environment and the actual 'creature' less than a dozen feet away.   Additionally, the headlights of the auto added lighting. However, my recollection is such that the ambient lighting from the moon was (if you assigned light character) perhaps 75%, and the remaining acuity of 25%, from the headlights. It was quite nearly like a full daylight sighting. "," See Time & Conditions. There were absolutely no manmade structures or lights from any structures for dozens of miles leading up to sighting. Also, there were no lights of structures for dozens of miles after the sighting.  Quite literally, we were in the middle-of-nowhere. I recall that there was no other auto traffic, period.

We had traveled to the end of forest route 3n83 and had planned to camp in the general area for the night. Later on my father and told me that all this was planned so i could get used to hunting, and camping, this was a surprise for my 13th birthday. he said that we were supposed to spend two days there. We began to travel east of the end of the road. We walked for about 20 minutes through moderatley dense underbrush and reached a clearing where my dad decided to teach me how to make a fire. After around two hours i finally succeeded in making a fire. At around 4:30pm I finally made a fire. At this time my father decided to camp here, his friends agreed and set about setting up camp.         Now as they set up they talked about there other hunting experiances, me being young and stupid i decided to re-enact some of the stories. I decided to walk in a general east direction playing with a stick pretending it was a rifle. I eventually got to a smaller clearing and saw a squirell or some other small mammal and decided to chase it. It ran across the clearing and up the nearest tree. I threw two rocks at it and then became bored. So i continued in the direction i was headed. I came to an area where the tress thinned and i could see a meadow. At this time it had just begun to get dark. I turned around to go back to the camp when I noticed a terrible odor. It smelled like a very large wallowy pig. I covered my nose and continued walking. I began hearing brush breaking about 50 -100 feet behind me. At this time i noticed that me father and his friends had begun to look for me and I could hear them calling. As soon as i could hear the voices the brush breaking stopped so i ran back to the camp.          When i got back to where they were they had already started to pass around beef jerky and water. I sat next to my father and awaited the food. That night i was in a tent with my father who was sound asleep, when i thought i heard some brush breaking. We had divided our group into three tents, two in each. I sat there very still not sure what to do but i felt that something was wrong. I quietly woke up my dad to tell him about the sound. He woke up and I motioned him to be quiet and he heard the brush breaking around the edge of our camp. He grabbed his hand gun, and yelled whos there? The brush breaking stopped and then the area got quiet. My dad cocked the safety back and yelled again. This time there was a kind of crashing noise like a branch snapping, and then it got quiet. My dad crept form the tent and checked on the others, they were woken up by my dads yelling and had heard the crash. They lit a fire and remained awake the rest of the night.

06065,3413,26152,2004,Spring,June,CA,Riverside County,S.E. area of Round Valley in the Mt. San Jacinto Wilderness Area.,Idyllwild,Hwy 243,"    I was camping with my 7 year old son on top of Mt. San Jacinto, specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places.     My son and I had eaten dinner and were getting ready for bed. At about 10:00 p.m. we were in our sleeping bags, but still talking and planning the trip to the peak in the morning. Suddenly without warning we heard a loud, low pitched whooping call in the boulders just above us. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son asked me if that was a monkey and I, not wanting to deal with a panicked 7 year old, told him it was just an owl. We did not smell anything or hear footsteps. Everything calmed down and we finally fell asleep. About an hour later I heard a load boom that sounded close to the tent. I looked out the window in the tent and saw a few clouds in the moonlight so I pulled our boots into the tent in case we got a thunderstorm in the night.     The next morning we got up and had breakfast, then headed for the peak. We made the peak but by the time we got back to camp my knees were swollen and sore so I put some snow in a sandwich bag for a cold pack that evening to reduce the swelling for the trip out the next morning. That night was uneventful and we slept well in the high altitude air. The next morning we got up and began to pack up for our trip off the mountain. I went up on top of the boulders to make sure none of our trash had blown away from camp and make sure everything was picked up. I then saw what had made that load boom the night before last. 30 yards from our tent on top of those boulders was an 8 inch diameter ponderosa pine snapped off at the base. The tree was still green and fresh and had no rot in it and there was no wind to speak of either night. The only explanation I can come up with is that the animal that made that whooping sound had pushed the tree over. The tree was not aimed in the direction of our tent but rather parallel the direction our tent was pitched. I don't think the animal was trying to do any harm but may have just been expressing it's dominance over us.",,Just myself and my 7 yo son. We were talking.,,Started about 10:00 P.M.

People still live in the area of what is now called French Gulch.","Hwy. 299, & then up the French Gultch Rd.","I never thought I would write this sort of thing on this forum, but well...here goes. Way before I joined the Church, my young wife and I worked for a private school at the end of the road near French Gulch CA. This is on the edge of the Trinity Mountains (Big Foot Country), and about 25 miles into the woods, behind Clair Engle Lake. It was pretty isolated. Once in awhile log trucks would go by, but mostly no one used the road to come there or go past.  I was assigned midnight bed checks, and had to walk through the entire compound. This was a former ranch: the main house and girls cabins on one side, along with the Teacher's and staff cabins and trailer, and across the creek, and up the pasture alongside the woods, the boy's line of cabins.   To cross the creek, I could either wade or ford, where the cars crossed, or walk past the cook house, that sat next to the creek and cross over on a suspension bridge, that was about jeep wide. We used it only for walking. I sometimes waded because bears would come raid the trash cans, and that was a bother to get past them sometimes.   It was a bit crisp that night, so I decided to walk the bridge, cross the pasture, and walkup the half mile or so along the cabins, to check each one. My boots made a hollow thumping noise as I crossed, and the bridge began to sway like it always did, with a side to side motion, as well as a rolling wave to the deck. The water was about 5 feet below me, and only filled about 10 feet across the bottom. The edges of the creek, about 20 feet per side, were dry and exposed rocks and boulders. The creek was about 2 feet deep and swirled softly, chuckling between and over the rocks.   There was no moon, but there was sufficient starlight, to see, once I had walked from my trailer, to the bridge, about a quarter mile. A single yard light was on up at the owner's house, but none down at my end of the headquarters compound. I walked up to each cabin, and checked them all. Everyone was asleep, no deer were in the pasture, and the one horse we had, was up at the top end of the pasture, snorting at me, and pawing the ground. That was not unusual, so I just headed back to the bottom of the hill toward the bridge. The stars were bright, and the sky was black.   As I approached the bridge, I thought I could hear something near the trash cans on the creek side of the cook house. Something was snuffling around and then banging trash can lids onto the ground. ""Crap,"" I thought, ""Bears. I could hear whatever it was knocking over the cans, and rooting around in them. I was a bit frustrated, since the day guy was supposed to have taken them to town, that afternoon, to dump them to avoid just this sort of thing.   I picked up a couple of large smooth river rocks, and stepped onto the bridge. This bridge is about 60 feet long, a suspension bridge, about 15 feet wide. The cables are too high, except in the middle to touch, to use as a hand rail, then too low in the middle to use for that either. The planks are 3"" thick, 10 inches wide, very heavy, and heavily oiled. They made a deep thump when trod upon.  I stepped quietly onto the bridge, and drew back my arm. The animal had stopped, and with a whiff, dropped the can it was exploring with a crash. I threw the river rock as hard as I could, and it thumped down, just under the eaves of the building, and rolled into a can, Wham! I peered into the darkness, and shadow under the eaves of the cook shack, but could not see anything but a darker shadow, where I though this animal was. The animal gave out another ""Woof,"" like a bear would when he is trying to sniff something out.  As it stood, I realized, that although I couldn't see much, I could tell that a head and shoulders had risen about the edge of the eaves. ""Wow!"" My head was trying to compute, ""animal on top of a trash can, or a big animal on the ground, that eave is at least 8 feet from the ground..."" It wasn't making sense, but the moment didn't last long. With a rumble deep in its chest it began moving out into the open, toward the end of the bridge. I by now was almost to the middle, so I started backing up, and got to about 1/4th of the way from the end. I started hollering at it, and chucked the other two rocks I had with me, one landing at his feet, and the other hitting somewhere near his hip.   He came up out of a crouch, and stood erect. He was just shorter than the bridge uprights, and they were ten feet tall! ""Oh, crap"", I thought. As he walked forward, the gait was more like a big man, than any bear I had ever seen. Only he was far bigger than any man I had ever seen either. Its legs where long, and this was NO BEAR! Now here you are going to have to trust me. I have hunted all my life, and I am no city boy. I know a bear when I see one, and I had no reason to expect anything else here.   I began shouting at it, as I backed up. He stepped onto the bridge, and in two steps was over the free-swinging portion. The bridge sagged, and I jumped up and down, stomping my feet, and shouting. I backed to the ground, and bent to pick up some more rocks. I stepped forward, pounded on the bridge, and threw another rock; saying ""Hey, get!"" As the rock sailed I thought that I was using some puny weapons. I also realized my voice was pretty weak. I was scared **itless!   I threw two more rocks in quick succession, and they bounced on the deck, and flew off into the dark, one splashing into the creek. He dodged them handily. His eyes glowed in the dark, and he took a step closer. I started jumping up and down, and getting the bridge to moving sideways and up and down. I had a hold of one of the upright cables, and I had the bridge going pretty good. The animal held onto the cables, above his head, and then with one hand, he vaulted the cables, and disappeared below the bridge.   I thought he was headed my way under the bridge, and I jumped back off and grabbed a two handed rock, to smash his face or whatever I could. I realized I could hear him splashing in the creek, and peered into the darkness, and saw the form running upstream into the back country. I stood a second, heart pounding, and realized there was a foul stench in the air, as a slight breeze carried his scent from that side of the bridge. It smelled of dead animals, and rotten food, and funky bad feet and armpits.  I made my way across the bridge, across the compound, hefting the two handed rock, and eventually got to my trailer. No lights had come on in any of the cabins, or at the owner's house, and no one had come to help me. I slid open the glass door, stepped inside, and slid it back, and leaned against the wall. My wife was in back reading, with a small light on. She looked at me and asked me what was wrong. I don't know what that was, I won't argue for Bigfoot, nor any other animal. I know it was not a bear. I know what that looks like. ",,No!,,Clear dark night with no moon!,Steep canyons and hevily forested.,

Once you pass Fall River, take next right, road 21N25. It is several miles to the site on road 21N25.",Feather Falls,Forest Service RD 21N25 off Mill Rd,"The whole story begins several years ago, 1993 to be exact. At the time I worked for the US Forest Service, Plumas National Forest. At that time it was called the La Porte Ranger Dist. Long before this as a young youth my father had taught me to hunt, fish and trap. I made my spending cash in junior high and high school by trapping and like most young men thought I was Mr. Outdoors. I was in reality, a very good outdoorsman with several mountain lion sightings in my hunting and working career (16). Many were at very close range, within a few yards - much too close, but onto my only bigfoot sighting.   It was late September and after working as a firefighter for years, I had moved to Silviculture where I had been working for about 5 years. My tasks included overseeing contracts for reforestation of clear cuts including the marking and measuring of unit, overseeing contracts to clear the brush, plant, brush suppression and thinning of units, testing tree planting and counting trees per acre as well as identifying tree species. I had two jobs slated for the day. The first was to meet a contractor and show him his work site and then I was to proceed to far end of Watson Ridge which drops off into the Middle Fork of the Feather River in Northern CA out of Oroville. This is a very remote area designated a wild and scenic waterway. The site I was heading for was a set of three small clear cuts setting within a few hundreds of yards from each other. We referred to them as the Mountain Lion clearcuts because a lion lived in the area and between 4 of us, it had been seen 5 times in 3 months.   The clearcut I was going to was the northern most which was about 12 acres. It was basically a square shaped clearcut that sloped gently up a hill. In the lower NW corner was a patch of forest that was not cut about 20 feet circumference and located just a few yards into the clearcut from where you would park. I arrived at the site at about 11:20 and decided to eat lunch before I got started and though I would get into the uncut area while I ate to see if the lion would come by. I ate lunch and took and additional 30 minute break being very still and quiet to look for the lion. He never showed and I had work to do.   This day I was counting the number of trees in the clearcut that had been planted in spring. Doing this meant that I would start by placing a spike through the open end of a tape measure so I could pull out the tape and measuring 10 feet. Then I would start moving one direction and count every tree that fell into the 20 ft circumference. Each one of these was called a plot. In every third plot I also identified the types of trees. Then taking a compass, I would walk approx 120 yds and start the next plot repeating the process. I had left the brush and completed two plots and started walking to the third plot when I heard loud noise ahead of me at the edge of the clearcut. The noise was so loud that I assumed it was a cow and I did not even look up. After a few more steps, more noise and this time I instinctively did look up to see a large creature walking up the edge of the brush line about three feet out of  the clearcut. It was about 110 yards away.   The creature was walking North away from me at a 90 degree angle on two feet. I stood very straight up and down while walking. It only walked a few feet and then stopped, leaned over slightly and rested its forearms on a tan oak that was bent and facing horizontally in the air about 4 1/2 ft high. At this time, it was no further than 125 yards away. It remained there for about  45 seconds with its head turned over its left shoulder looking at me, Its head or chin did not set or rest on its shoulder as it did not seem possible for the creature to do so but its entire face was visible except for the lower mouth and chin. The creature was oriented so that I could see the entire left side from head to leg to about one foot from the ground. In addition, I could see its entire back and the back of the right leg from head to ground.  I could not see any of the right side or the front of the creature.  It stood about 66 to 7 ft tall. It was very lean and I would guess its weight at between 350 to 400 lbs. It may have been heavier; it is hard to determine that without ever seeing the front of the creature. Its legs, although a little longer than a mans, seemed proportioned to a mans in shape. From the waste up however, the creature was very very large. I would guess about 40 to 45 waste but 80 to 90 around the shoulders. It seemed very man like, covered in two to three inch hair that was red brown on the legs.  It got somewhat darker to a browner as it went up its back. The hair was much shorter and thinner around the butt got longer and thicker as it went up its back. The hair on its back was not as long as on its leg but by the time it got to its shoulders, it was longer again and brown to dark brown. The hair coming down the arm from shoulder to elbow was red and 2 long. At the elbow, the hair end and the actual elbow was covered with skin like leather that was black. Oddly enough, this is the feature that stands out the most still to this day.  The head was not as visible but human like. Hair longer on top and shorter around the sides with no hair from lower forehead to mouth. The hair on its head was dark brown to light black if such a color exists. For some reason, I never really focused on the face as it was shaded. I spent more time looking at the entire size of the creature and the bare elbow facing me. It was very calm as was I and I never felt any danger or anxiety from fear. I differently remember thinking that it is tripping on me and checking me out as much as I was tripping on it. As I stood there in the open, I had a strange since of peace.   After a minute, the creature lifted up off the tree, turned away slightly and took two steps and I never saw it again. I did not go look for tracks which still seems strange to me even now. Even after the creature left, I was not scared and continued to take plots for several hours. I was anxious to return to the office and tell my friend but within an hour of work, I had talked myself out of telling this story to anyone at work. I did eventually tell two or three other co-workers. I have not shared this story with many but now am 50 years old and dont really care what people believe or think of me.   Sorry for making he story so long. Im sure I could find the exact site of this encounter again but being many years old, it probably would not help.

He would know of this place and all. My dad does not remember either. This was a long time ago, and I will never forget it.  Ever! ",Lake Hughes ,Lake Hughes Road ,"On a day after the snow had fallen, we went hunting up in the Lake Hughes area in California. There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife's uncle is gone from his cabin and won't be back any time soon, so why don't we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch.   Well, he lives by Lake Hughes's road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise.   We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let's get over there and see what's up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print's and smelled something like a dog that's been wet and rotten egg's mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate.   We went over to the prints, and I'm 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider.  Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don't walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch.   I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don't think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there.   N. F.

06093,3590,27819,2010,Spring,May,CA,Siskiyou County,Please edit out location specifics.,Yreka,Interstate 5,"Year: 2010 Season: Spring Month: May Date: 5/12 State: California County: Siskiyou  Directions to location: edited out, per request of the submitter.  Observed: This trip was, in actuality, an expedition my brothers and myself had planned into the mountains of Siskiyou county. Our rationale came from an obscure Californian document called ""The Hermit of Siskiyou,"" which records one of the earliest Sasquatch encounters in the state as having occurred in this area.  In addition, the book also goes on to note that it was well known amongst the locals at that time that these creatures wintered in the caves, ""makes winter quarters in some of the caves of the Marble Mountains"".  We also felt that since we would, in all likelihood, be the first people into the backcountry this early in the season it would increase our chances of encountering some sort of activity.  An early scouting trip on 5/10 supported our suspicions.  Late afternoon on Monday, May 10th, we left our hotel in Yreka and headed out into the mountains to familiarize ourselves with the trailhead we would be using early the next morning for our hike into the valley. The weather was quite raw, chilly with cold rain. At approximately 4 pm, as we were winding up the forest service road, we came to what may be described as an overlook or turnout. We decided to pull over and get our first real look at the mountains we would be hiking into the next day. We stopped the Jeep and my two brothers bounded out of the front and began taking pictures. I was just opening the rear door on the passengers side when I suddenly heard what I can only describe as a loud and prolonged, AHHHHH!, coming from my 11 oclock from a low hill roughly 400 yards away. It was a very strange sound and completely unlike anything I had ever heard in the woods before. (I live deep in the High Peaks of the Adirondacks, so I am no stranger to backcountry sounds.) It sounded like a man sort of yelling but it had a deep, animal-like quality to it. I asked my brothers if they had heard the sound, but they said that they hadnt. In fact, I believe that they thought I was joking.   After a few more minutes of snapping pictures, glassing the slope and waiting around to see if whatever had made that sound was going to make it again (it didnt) we piled back into the Jeep and continued up the mountain.  We followed this road all the way to the trailhead (one of our two options for tomorrows hike) without incident.  Coming back down the mountain, we now turned left onto another forest service road to reconnoiter the second trailhead. Conditions immediately went from raw to terrible. This forest service road is unpaved and the cold rain now changed to snow the higher we climbed. (Our elevation at this point was somewhere between 3,500-4,000 feet.) There had obviously been snow at some earlier point because the road had roughly an inch to an inch and a half of old snow scattered on it and piled up on the sides in patches. My brother suggested that we might want to get out of the Jeep and scan the side of the road in order to see if we could come upon any kind of tracks. We were not thinking Bigfoot at this point, we were just trying to get an idea of what kind of animals we might be encountering in the next few days. Almost immediately, we found some large and clear bear tracks. These were good-sized tracks and I would guesstimate that they were from some 300-500 lb. animal. (Again, I live in the Adirondacks and we are well stocked with bears.)  I mention these tracks because as we were following them up the hill we came across a very different set of tracks.  At approximately 4:45 pm we encountered a second set of tracks crossing the road. These tracks were moving perpendicular to the bear tracks we had been following and were clearly NOT bear tracks. The first track was approximately 17-18 inches long and 6 inches in width. It looked exactly like a naked human footprint, but there was little visible arch. In other words, it was rather filled in where you would expect the arch indentation to be. The print appeared to be from a right foot and a clearly defined big toe was visible. It also seemed as if the bear we had been following had stepped directly into this track but it in no way obscured what we were looking at. These two types of tracks were directly before us so that I can say, as far as comparisons between the two, this new set of tracks had come from some completely different animal.  Following the track, a 2nd track was discernable roughly 4 to 4 ½ feet from the first track across the road. This track was much more degraded than the first track but appeared to be from a left foot of consistent dimensions with the first. The conditions wouldnt allow for any casting and, besides, we had left nearly all of our equipment back at the hotel. This was supposed to have been an in-and-out scouting run and, consequently, we were poorly prepared to document any findings. The spotty snow and the lay of the land discouraged our finding any more tracks and so, snapping too few pictures, we continued up the mountain to the junction near the lake.  I must add, at this point, that our finding of these tracks in no way involved any skill on our parts. This was an instance of pure DUMB LUCK. If we had arrived any later, the quickly deteriorating weather conditions would have destroyed these tracks without our ever having found them. We were extremely lucky to have come across them when we did. It must also be noted that there were no signs of anyone else having come into that area before us. The only tire tracks in the mud and the snow on that road had come from our Jeep. Until we had gotten there, everything seemed to have been completely undisturbed.  Further up, the road splits with the right fork heading toward a camp and the way ahead leading toward a lake. To our left was an animal corral and a short road leading to a dead end in a gravel excavation. These details would be important later but, for the moment, we decided to try forging up the road toward the lake. The way soon became impassable with snow and, having gotten the Jeep stuck a number of times, we turned back to begin our return to Yreka.  Returning down the FS road we were approaching the overlook/turnout where I had heard the strange, AHHHHH! We were discussing this sound when we decided to enter the turnout again, being much more focused and alert this time, to see if it would repeat itself. At 5:35 pm, we put the windows down, turned the Jeep off and coasted into the turnout. Almost immediately the same prolonged, AHHHHH, came from the same direction from which I had heard it the first time. My brother in the front seat said, I heard that!, and we all got out of the Jeep. It was deathly quiet after we had gotten out, but two of us had definitely heard the sound this time as we had entered the turnout.  After waiting a few minutes for a repetition of the noise and getting nothing but silence in return, my first brother asked my second brother to Whoop at the hill which the sound had seemed to come from. I was returning to the Jeep when my second brother let out a bone jarring, Whoop! (a skill he apparently learned on two previous, official BFRO expeditions.) I did not hear it, probably due to my position in the Jeep, but my first brother said that within several seconds of my second brothers having Whooped, 5-6 hard wood knocks suddenly came from the same hillside where he and I had heard the strange vocalization.   We are all very clear on what happened next.  We were all out of the Jeep now, straining to hear if we could catch any more wood knocks when a blood-curdling scream suddenly came from our 2 oclock. It was a very high-pitched, prolonged, almost feminine sounding scream that seemed to be coming from a fairly good distance away. (I dont want to speculate on exactly how far.) The scream did not in any way sound like any type of big cat or some kind of bird. It sounded like a loud, human scream.  It was startling and more than a little unnerving.  My second brother gave another loud, Whoop, but we got no further responses. After the scream, the woods remained quiet.  With absolutely nothing happening, being a little rattled and with evening closing in, we got back into the Jeep and drove to Yreka for the night.  May 11th, weather conditions were beautiful as we drove into the camp trailhead early in the morning to begin our hike into the valley. Temperatures were expected to be near the 70s and the sky was bright and clear. We thought that we would be able to hike the roughly 7 and a half miles into the valley in about 5 hours.  60 lb packs and much more snow than we had anticipated quickly put an end to that idea.  We decided to retreat to our fallback position and attempt an entry from near the lake. We knew from the night before that road directly to the trailhead soon became impassable for the Jeep a short distance beyond the camp junction, but it appeared from our map that it would be a relatively short hike in to the trailhead from where we would have to ditch our vehicle. While we had encountered snow up from the junction, we hoped that it was just a bad patch and that the snow would break and the hiking would be easier once we got through that particular area.  Again, that proved not to be the case.  Stuck now and wondering just how we were going to get into the valley, we realized that we were going to have to make a choice. We could either scrap our idea of getting into the valley from these approaches, take the long drive into Eureka and attempt an entry by going up a creek, or make camp somewhere in the immediate area and attempt a dash into the lake area with extremely stripped down daypacks.  Hating the idea of another long car ride and of wasting another day without getting into the woods, we opted to find a spot close to the camp / lake junction.  Driving the Jeep up the dead end road, past the animal corral, we set up camp in the old gravel pit.   Our camp was situated in a flat, roughly 50 yard in diameter hollow, ringed by rough mounds of rock and gravel. Our GPS indicated that our base camp was sitting at 4,862 feet. Aside from having to hike a short distance downhill for water, our camp offered us a relatively protected haven on the mountaintop.  I want to make our situation clear in light of subsequent events. We did not intend to be where we were. We were forced to make last minute decisions if we were going to try and stay with our original plans of getting into this specific valley. Our position wasnt ideal, but it did provide us with a moderate degree of comfort and a footing for making a dash into the desired area.   We settled into our camp and the rest of the day passed uneventfully.  After a dinner of some MREs, we passed a very quiet and bitterly cold night.   The morning of May 12th couldnt come too soon.  The night before had been almost too much for the gear (20 degree bags and a couple of three season tents) we had with us. I woke up at about 6:30 to winter cold and an icy tent. My second brother was already up while my first brother appeared to have retreated to the Jeep sometime during the night. He had gotten his feet wet before climbing into his bag and had been forced to use the heater in the Jeep to stop his feet from freezing.  We decided to leave him in the Jeep and let him sleep.  At around 8am, my second brother and I decided to gather some snow to make coffee. As the gravel pit was entirely snow free, we had to walk down past what we had nicknamed the OK Corral to the junction, where there was still plenty of snow. Off to our left, a couple of hundred feet down a very steep decline from our camp, we could hear the fairly loud rushing water of a creek. As neither of us relished the idea of trying to work down that decline and then struggle back up just to get some water, we were going to make do with the snow at hand. We were just beginning to gather some snow when we suddenly heard the sound of rocks being banged together in the creek bed below us. It was very clear and very distinct. The rocks were being banged together in series of threes. Bang-Bang-Bang. There were always three bangs with equal intervals between strikes. To me, these bangs sounded entirely deliberate.   After the first three bangs, I said to my brother, Did you hear that? He was replying that he had when the rocks banged again. Thankfully, I had brought a Handy Cam with us and I now started shooting. My brother decided to try another of his Whoops to see if we could get any response from whatever was banging rocks together in the creek. He let out his Whoop and after 5 seconds we suddenly heard four loud bangs from down in the creek bed. Again, these were very loud bangs and they were clearly being made by whatever was down in the creek smashing stones together.  This last series of four bangs were clearly picked up by the Handy Cam.  After the last series of bangs, there were no more sounds from down in the creek.  Excited and a little flustered, we rushed back to the camp to wake up our brother in the Jeep. After getting him up, we told him what had happened when we had gone to gather snow. He was excited, but said that he had been sleeping and that he hadnt heard a thing.  A Zoom H2 that wed had running at the time may have picked up the banging in the creek but hasnt been properly reviewed as of this writing.  At roughly 9am, my second brother and I were sitting around drinking coffee and getting things ready for our attempted dash into the lake area. My first brother was walking toward the steep slope on the edge of our camp that lead down into the creek when suddenly a very loud, canine bark startled all of us. The bark sounded like a large dogs, Woof. The sound had come from close below us, somewhere back in the direction of the OK Corral. We all looked up and I fully expected to see a big dog come running into camp being followed by a ranger.  No such dog or ranger appeared.  In fact, we looked everywhere to find the animal that had made that sound but nothing was moving on that mountain. I have heard deer and elk bark and this deep woof was nothing like that. It sounded exactly like the biggest dog in any suburban neighborhood. While that sound wouldnt seem out of place back in civilization, it seemed entirely out of place and strange in our isolated setting.  It was so out of place that we all noted it.  Unfortunately, I had already packed up the Zoom for our hike and completely missed catching the sound.  Cleaning up and shouldering our packs, we struck out for the lake.  We started walking up the forest service road, making for the trailhead. From the trailhead, it would be what we had read was a comparatively easy, little over a mile hike in to the lake. From this lake, we would be within striking distance of a second lake, which figured into two sightings reports from last year (2009).  It seemed pretty straightforward.  It wasnt.  As the road rose up from the junction, the snow got worse. We would go through large patches that would come almost to our knees only to break through to long stretches of bare earth. It was slow going, but doable. If we had known that we would encountering so much snow, we would have been better prepared with snowshoes, poles and full winter gear. As it was, we were going through terrain in conditions we probably had no business to be attempting with woefully inadequate gear.  No one said we were smart.  About three miles in, we encountered a cinnamon bear. Off to our right, coming up quite a steep slope through a section of burn-out, a small to medium (about 200 lb) bear was lumbering towards us. The bear was about 30 yards away and, at first, didnt see us. We stopped and, not relishing the thought of a closer encounter, we caught the bears attention and began to identify ourselves. The bear stopped and a tense five-minute stare down began. The bear seemed to be standing its ground and didnt particularly appear to want to back down. We yelled and tried to make ourselves look bigger, but none of this seemed to impress the bear. I make these points because before me, at relatively close range, I was able to observe a native bear in the wild and to see how this bear would move through these woods.   This becomes important later.  After yelling and waving for what felt like a long time, a can of Counter Assault was produced and we got ready for the bear. Suddenly my first brother, having had enough of this war of wills, shouted an expletive and began throwing rocks at the bear. This did the trick and the bear took off at a run back down the slope.  I say this again to emphasize that I had before me a living example of how a bear looked running through those woods.  We continued trekking into the trailhead, coming across deeper and deeper patches of snow, until we finally reached the true start of our hike at about 2 oclock.   Post holing now into snow at times up to our thighs and waists, it became pretty clear that the inner valley was effectively sealed off. Even though the temperature was in the low 70s and it was a bright, sunny day, the conditions were just too much.  We decided to make some lunch and then begin the hike back to base camp. We made a small fire and had some MREs.  It was after 2:45pm when we started our return to base camp and the going wasnt any easier on the way back. Later, my first brother confessed that he had begun to feel uneasy at the snowed-in trailhead. He had said nothing to me at the time, but he later told me that he had confessed to our second brother that he felt like we were being watched from the moment wed gotten there.  Much later, after wed returned home, he said that, at points, while we had been working our way back down the FS Road from the lake, he had had the strangest sensations. He said that he could feel a prickly feeling along his scalp and that he could literally feel the hair standing up on the back of his neck. He said that hed never felt anything quite like this before and that it happened twice on our return trip. Subsequently, he began lingering behind my second brother and I and videoing longer stretches of the return hike.  Neither my second brother nor I experienced this uncomfortable feeling of being under observation.  Things continued like this until a point approximately 2 miles from the camp /  lake junction on the FS Road.  At approximately 4pm, I was actually bringing up the rear. We were a little tired by this point and we had grown quite loud, laughing and talking. I was raising my hand in a sweeping gesture to finally point at the ridiculously steep grade of the ridge on our right which we were in the process of traversing. As I raised my hand, pointing and making some stupid joke, something suddenly moved on the slope in front of me. From about 30 yards up the slope, something suddenly darted out from behind a tree and ran up the slope to a second group of trees. My first impression was the size of the object. It was big, at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall. My second brother is 62 and it was just about his size, if not a little bit bigger. It was bulky and muscular, and I immediately thought of a jacked-up football player. I could only see it from the waist up, due to foliage on the slope, but what I could clearly see was an upright muscular form running for the trees.   I will elaborate more on this figure in a moment.  My second impression was the speed at which the figure was moving. Whatever it was, it was moving over impossible terrain at a FRIGHTENING speed. I immediately thought that nothing that big should be able to move that fast. It was moving from left to right from one tree up a very steep angle of ascent (I guesstimate a 60 degree incline) at an angle to a second V-shaped group of two trees. It covered 10-15 yards in no time, moving over ground that we would have had to have climbed almost on our hands and knees. Once it reached that second group of trees, it was gone. I do not know what it did or where it went after it reached those trees. I also noticed that, whatever this was, it did not bob as it ran. It looked almost as if the figure were gliding up the slope on a track. I can say with utmost certainty, IT DID NOT MOVE LIKE A BEAR. This upright figure was nothing like the bear we had seen earlier. Whatever this was, it was unique and I have never, before or since, seen anything like it.  My last impression was of its color. The figure appeared to be covered with a uniform coat of hair that was 2-3 inches in length. This hair was primarily of a coyote or burnt sienna color but there was also a lot of grey mixed in. Its fur looked almost brindled, meaning that there was almost as much grey as brown. If it hadnt of moved, I never would have seen it. Standing still, the animal blended perfectly into its background.  All of this transpired in the seconds it took this animal to travel the 10-15 yards between the trees.  Looking back on the figure I had seen, I can say that its form was basically that of an upright human, but there were definitely some gorilla-like characteristics as well. I saw the animal primarily from the side with a great deal of back and shoulders being presented, as if it were turning away from me. It ran with its right arm folded across its face and seemed to be looking over the top of its arm as it moved. I could see no features because of this arm covering its face, but a conical head and the edge of what appeared to be a crest were visible. The animal displayed a pronounced musculature, and I was particularly struck by the sheer size of the bicep, its back and the massive traps. Like a gorilla, I could see no neck. As already stated, the foliage obscured the rest of the animal.  I immediately shouted something like, Over there!, but by that time it was too late and whatever it was was gone.  I cannot stress enough to any one who has never seen an animal like this how profoundly disturbing the speed at which this animal is capable of moving is. I had been holding a Handy Cam on standby and ready to go and I was never able to get off a shot. I believe this is exactly why more of these animals havent been filmed: they just move too fast.  All I could do was stand there pointing with my mouth hanging open.  My brothers asked me what was going on and I tried to tell them. I know that they did not believe me at first. I kept insisting that Id just seen a Bigfoot run up the side of the mountain and, gradually, they started to realize that I wasnt joking. We stood there for a few minutes, gawking and staring up the side of the mountain into the trees, but there were absolutely no sounds or movement coming from the direction in which the creature had gone. My second brother went so far as to try using some samurai  chatter in hopes of eliciting some response from the animal if it were hiding close by, but there was no response.   After about 10 minutes of nothing, we decided to continue on our way back to camp.  I know that this was a decision that will frustrate many people who might read this report and it deserves a word of explanation. On my part, the thought of climbing up that slope to search for prints, hair, or possibly even another look at the animal did not even enter my mind. I must stress that the thought was never there to be dismissed. It was inconceivable. Now, I equate it to sitting in a small boat fishing when, suddenly, something large and unknown cruises under your boat. You do not think of jumping into the water to see what that large thing was. This is not fear. From my brief experience, all I can say is that you do not naturally want to move closer to one of these animals. The reason is as simple as that.  Ironically, although my brothers hadnt seen the animal, they didnt discuss going up that slope either. It just didnt feel right.  From that point on, although we were all keyed-up and anxiously waiting for something else to happen, we returned to base camp without further incident.  It was now sometime after 5pm and we had some decisions to make. Basically, we debated whether or not we should stay or, in light of that days activity, pull out.  We opted to break camp and spend the night in Willow Creek.  This decision also deserves a word of explanation. Our first consideration was the extremely difficult weather conditions that we had been enduring from the start of the expedition. We had been in snow and facing below freezing conditions that we had not been prepared for. The thought of another icy night in the tents or, worse, all of us crammed into the Jeep trying to stay warm were hard trials to think about. While the daytime temperatures were mild and pleasant, the nighttime almost 5,000 feet up in a gravel pit on the top of a mountain was brutal. In this regard, we were not being smart. Our second consideration was the thought of the animal we had just encountered, both directly and indirectly, paying us a visit in the darkness. While my brothers were game for such an encounter, I most definitely was not. This was not coming from fear on my part; I will argue that it was just good common sense. It was definitely going to take me some time to adjust to what I had just seen. In the end, my brothers gave in to my desire to pullout. I am grateful to them.  I still dont regret our decision.  Feeling pretty damn happy with everything wed accomplished already, we ended this leg of our expedition.  Having had some time now to mentally digest what had happened during our short stay in these mountains, my brothers and I have put together some ideas concerning the activity we observed:  1. We definitely feel that whatever was making those AHHHHH! calls on our first day was acting as some sort of sentry or lookout. Whatever was watching the road only called out when we came into view and its position allowed it an excellent opportunity to monitor all possible human traffic into and out of those valley access points. (We did not hear it during our final departure from the mountains but it was getting quite late by then.)  2. Based on the fact that something screamed from a second position in seeming response to the first callers woodknocks, there was definitely more than one of the creatures in the area.  3. Based on my brothers intuitions, my sighting, and a subsequent development, we feel that we picked up something at the snowed-in trailhead and that this something was trailing us from higher up on the side of the mountain during our return hike to base camp.  4. I believe that my sweeping/pointing gesture caused the animal to believe that it had been observed and that this caused it to break and run for new cover. This is the only reason we even knew the animal was there.  I also would like to add a final observation concerning the creature I observed. One of the names the Native Americans of Northern California have for this creature is Tintah-kiwungxoyan, which translates into something like Boss of the Mountain. I can think of no better name for the animal I saw. This animal seems perfectly suited for its environment. It can blend into and move through its terrain at will. Its size suggests a lot of power and its speed is startling. It outclasses us in the backcountry in every possible way. This animal could have, if it had wanted to, taken us at any time and there would have been very little we could have done about it. It definitely deserves our respect and protection.  I would also like to add two postscripts to this report:  1. On May 13th,  we stopped by the China-Flat Museum to see the Bigfoot wing. While we were there, we were talking to Peggy McWilliams from the museum about what wed experienced during our short stay in those mountains. After some interesting comments on her own part about those caves near the rim, she called our attention to a gentlemen who was just entering the museum. This gentleman turned out to be Al Hodgson. After some brief small talk, we told Mr. Hodgson about our recent experiences. He was quite interested and, at several points during our story, actually made the comment, That sounds about right. We showed him the pictures of the tracks and these also seemed to intrigue him. When all was said and done, he very kindly asked us for our names and our contact numbers. As he was leaving, he turned to me with a smile and said, In forty years, Ive never seen one. He was a  gentleman from beginning to end, fascinating to talk to and a genuine pleasure to have met.  2. On May 25th, my second brother was reviewing the footage from his video camera. We had been shooting with two cameras and we had well over 12 hours of footage to go over. While reviewing footage we had shot on May 12th, he came to a portion that he had filmed after our return to base camp from our hike back from the lake trailhead. This footage was shot just as we reentered camp and were facing back toward the mountain and the junction. While it will never convince the skeptical, the video shows something large moving through the trees until it comes to a small clump. The object ducks down and then what appears to be a head pokes out on one side, facing in the direction of our camp. The shot ends after about 40 seconds.   None of us had any idea at the time that the figure was there.  Its an intriguing end to a very intriguing experience. I am extremely happy to have some evidence to support my sighting. In retrospect, I am even more glad now that we didnt attempt climbing up that slope after the running figure. This video seems to suggest that whatever it was, it never moved after it hid behind those trees. If we had climbed that slope, I now believe that the animal I had seen would have been waiting there. In all likelihood it would have run again, but I really would hate to think about having an up-close, face-to-face encounter with whatever was on that mountain. In addition, in light of the fact that this video was shot almost 2 miles further down the FS Road from where I had initially seen the creature, I now believe that this animal waited for us to move and then continued tracking us all the way back to our camp.  While I dont in any way feel that we were in serious danger from this creature, I feel even better now about having spent that last night in Willow Creek.

We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort, which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake.   The first night we stayed at the resort, June 30, 2010, my brother, my father and I were watching TV in the front of the cabin and at around 11:30pm we went out on our deck to look out at the amazing view we had. Within five minutes the silence was broken when we heard a howl in the distance, which sounded like it was coming from the granite formations, which over looked the resort. All of us froze. The sound scared us because we had never heard a sound like that before. The vocalization lasted under a minute.   We waited for another 10-15 minutes out on the deck to see if whatever made the howl would howl again. But it did not howl again so we went back inside and I took a shower. While I was showering my brother and father continued to watch TV, but this time they opened up all the windows in the cabin to see if they could hear the howling again. When I got out of the shower ten minutes later, my brother and father told me they heard the same sound again when I was in the shower and this time my mother who was in bed with her window open heard the howling too. This time there were three howls, which were all shorter than the first howl we heard on the deck and there was only about 20 seconds in between each howl. My family and I stayed there another night but did not hear any more howls. ","I live in the Santa Clara Valley near the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Saratoga Foothills.

Find Peltier road and drive about 8-10 miles down until you find a bridge that is connected to Mackville road. Drive on it until you find highway 88. It takes you right to it. If you are coming from the south drive through stockton on freeway 99 until you find the off ramp for highway 88.,"The town I live in is called Clements, but the nearest cities are Lodi/Stockton/Valley Springs/Jackson.",It happened on a highway actually. highway 88 and the nearest to it is highway 12.,"It happened a couple nights ago. I was watching a movie in my room when I heard a noise outside. This was about 1 in the morning PST. It sounded like a long blowing horn, so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again, and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl, like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs, and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn't want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion, but the one thing that confused me was I don't think animals like them sound like that.   The day after this happened, my friend came to pick me up around 8 at night. We enjoy going to casinos, and there is one about 35 miles from where I live. The sun had just set, and we drove maybe no more than 4 miles down the road when I heard the noise again. I rolled the window down more, and my friend heard it too. It was close to where we were, so we slowed down to get a better hear. The noise stopped, so we started driving again. About no more than ten seconds later we saw what looked like a 10 foot man, covered in hair. This is not a joke, and when the headlights shined on his eyes they glowed. Human eyes don't do that! He was pretty far from our vehicle, and no I didn't see his face. His hair was black maybe dark brown, and yes his eyes glowed by light! The first thing we both thought was bigfoot, but neither of us agreed. I did a little look-up on my computer and found information on bigfoot. The howling, and the sight of that animal could not have been a human, and if it were then he had some massive eyes with big contacts to make them glow like that. I am pretty sure the car behind us saw it too, because they slowed down and stayed behind for about a minute after we drove away. We went about our business to the casino that night after our encounter, and now I am a true believer and have decided to notify you about this.","Just the sounds. I've never heard anything like it that was so scary. If it's bigfoot or not, I don't want it coming around my house.",My friend who was in the car with me.,No.,"The noises I heard was the night before we saw it, so the 24th at around 1 or 2 in the morning PST. The night we saw it was the 25th, around 8 at night.","Cold, but clear skies. We live close to the mountains, but the area we saw him in was just field. It's a rural area. There is some forest areas close by and some lakes called amador and camanche. I've lived out here since I was 13 and know the area pretty good. There is also a river that flows through very close to where it happened called mokelumne river. The bridge I mentioned that connects to mackville road runs right across the river.","October 25, 2010"

I had to dim my head light's again and as we just passed,8 mile bridge I figured that I should hit the brights lights as we went around a vary slight curve (thats when) I hit the brights at that same moment a large rock (bolder ) stood up (straight up).

[East of San Diego] The campground is called Burnt Rancheria.    It was exactly 3:14am. My wife woke me up because she needed to use the restroom really bad.  The restroom was about 50 yards away and she was afraid to go alone.  As I was putting on my shoes, I started hearing sounds that reminded me of an ax hitting wood (or a tree), but louder.  It wasnt like someone was cutting wood, because the sounds were not in rapid succession, they were 2 or 3 seconds apart. In total I think I heard 4 or 5 of them.  I put on my shoes, stepped out of my tent, and kept hearing them, finally realizing that they sounded like the knocking sounds described by people who have reported bigfoot encounters.    After about 5 seconds they stopped, and (I dont know if this was just my imagination or not) I started to hear echoes of voices.  I say voices because it sounded like someone talking but at the same time it was gibberish with grunts.    The next day my sister in law, who was camping with us, started to give us a hard time about all the noise we were making getting out of the tent and going to the rest room.  So I asked her if she heard the knocking sounds she said she did. She described them as someone dropping a heavy rock on a ply wood.  I asked my wife if she heard them but she said she was still half asleep and trying not to wet herself.  Ive seen the show Finding Bigfoot and know what sounds sasquatches reportedly make, but I never thought I would actually hear them.

Two of the witnesses are RN's. I am an Appraiser. What made this sighting of tracks credible to me were the existence of so many other tracks, including bear, that gave good comparison to other critters and size.  The tracks came up out from the gulch, followed the road a bit, then back down into the gulch. Also my friend noticed smaller Bigfoot tracks coming down from a very steep draw on the left of the road. There were no tracks going up, just coming down, as if to ""join"" the others.

06003,4216,39181,2012,Fall,September,CA,Alpine County,"We went into the backcountry by way of a trailhead off of Highway 4 west of Markleeville, CA.  ",Markleeville ,Wolf Creek Road,"Three of us went on a deer hunt that morning. We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans.   Anyway halfway up the mountain my uncle went to the right (SE) and I went left (NW). The southside of the mountain (which I was on) was open with sage brush and scattered cypress trees. In the gulches of the face, were thick timber groves of mainly large pine trees, clustered, only to be seperated by the openess I just described.My plan was to stay in the tree groves working my way to the peak driving the deer to the top of the hill where the other hunter was positioned. I worked the grove until it ended forcing me to cross a clearing to the left to enter the grove located under the peak. When I got to the right vertical edge of the treeline to the grove, I found the first blind. It was made of a broken branch that was placed up side down and leaning against a tree. The branch was interwoven into the branches of the larger tree. At this time I had a feeling I was being watched and assumed it was the other two hunters that weren't in our party that were camped a couple hundred yards from us at the base of the mountain.   I continued left into the grove and found a 25 foot tree placed upside down next to another tree well over 50 feet high. The base was about 18"" and had been snapped not sawed. Some branches had interwoven into this tree just like the little blind I first discovered on the groves edge. I'd guess the elevation was 8,500 feet, as the top of the hill was 10,000 and our camp was at the base of about 7,000. I now had an increasingly strong feeling of being watched again at this point.   As I left the second blind/upsidown tree working my way up and to the left I saw the silhouette of a bipedal primate about 8 feet tall standing still looking at me. It was perpendicular to me, faced up hill in almost a runners stance, and looking over its right shoulder, at me, slightly with its wide muscular torso turned to me. It's brow was extremly pronounced, its forehead was small with the back of it's head slightly pointed. His head (assuming a male as it did not have breasts,) was proportionatly small in relation to it's body. It's arms were extremly long, hairy, lean yet muscular, It's hands had very long palms and long fingers that curled back with a thumb that curled forward forming a backward capital ""C"" type shape. It then sprinted up the hill and vanished behind the trees faster than a deer bolts into a dead run from a standstill. It was on the left edge of the grove with a clearing behind it. This all happened in a second or two. I went to the place I saw it (60 yards) and found no footprints as the ground had at least a foot of pine needles that cushioned footprints and would spring back up when you walked. I used a tree that was close by gauge it's height. It was of dark color but not sure if dark brown or black as it was shady in the grove with sunlight behind it in the clearing.   I was in a state of kind of shock and almost not believing what I saw but knowing I did and simply just amazed. Because of this when I got home, later that week I decided to consult a hypnotist. I had never seen one but figured since they help witnesses recall a crime and descriptions of accounts that happen quickly or under stress it would probably help me confirm what I saw. The hypnosis confirmed my sighting.   ","Two things to note of interest now was after seeing the bigfoot was at the top of the grove just below the top of the hill was a deer kill. It had some of the hide and dried flesh on it's bones and was probably killed a few weeks prior. Secondly that night at camp after dinner, I kind of brought up the subject of the show (Finding Bigfoot) to my hunting party to gauge their opinion on bigfoot and none of them believed in bigfoot. Two of the guys actually made fun of the squatch hunters. One of the guys let out a howl (in a mocking / joking, manner) and no more than a minute or two passed when we heard cracking sounds of timber then a huge tree by our camp come crashing down. I didn't put two and two together but after reading up on other sightings in Alpine County I learned of sasquatches pushing over trees to intimidate people and scare people away. The deer kill and tree falling was what I learned about bigfoot after researching it. Before that day I never gave bigfoot much thought and frankly didn't care if it did or didn't exist. Well now I know there are here, and it is a creature that needs to be protected and respected. The only way we can pass laws to do so is prove that they do exist.   ",No other witnesses.

The Snowcreek Golf Course  is on the left side of the road, and a field is on the right.  The road has a few curves in it.        As I was coming around a curve, my headlights were shining into the field, and I saw a large figure walking, probably at least one hundred yards away.  I noticed that the figure seemed really large for being that far away from me.  It had a very definite stride, with its arms extended out in front, rotating from front to back.  It was traveling through the field at a good pace.  I thought gee, that's a really big guy walking, what is he doing out here so early in the morning, in that cold, dark field.  He didn't even turn his head with the headlights beaming in his direction, like it didn't bother him a bit.  He just kept walking towards town.

06017,4596,47165,2014,Summer,July,CA,El Dorado County,It's easier to describe on the phone or in person. ,Pollock Pines? ,Hwy 50,"I live in the ""Bay Area"" of California. My visual sighting is at the bottom of this report. I have photos of that I want to send. I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were ""dispersed camping"" (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50, about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river.   Some time in the night, probably 1-4 AM, my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away, and it sounded like the person's legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water. Sure enough, a few seconds after she whispered this to me, I heard the noise too. She was accurate in her description of the sound. I guess my protective instincts kicked in because without hesitation I unzipped the tent with my large mag-light in hand, (the type police officers use) and stood outside my tent, spotlighting the river bank and the forest around us. I saw nothing, so I called out that there were people and please go the other way, still heard nothing. After that we didn't hear any more unusual sounds. What struck me as odd was, why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours, not anywhere near any trails, and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it's a mile from our car, down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush, which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find, and why it stays secluded.)   It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs, not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water. Plus, there was nothing in the river I could see so whoever or whatever would've had to be farther than we thought and therefor very large to make sound seem so close...   The next morning we went for a long hike as it was our last day camping. We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a, sort of, for a last glance, I will miss you, type of look, and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree, it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little, almost like it was positioning itself comfortably, and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear. But then I saw the second ""bear"" in the SAME spot as this one in a tree right next to it. At this point I'm about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in. I was able to take many photos of these ""bears"" and I have them on my phone and will send them to anyone who wants to see. On closer inspection, these were not bears. I showed a few friends and family and they all see what I see, it appears there is a UNIFORM Jet Black sillouette of a large, lean human man. When you see these pictures you will get an off/odd feeling. I know they weren't bears and I know they weren't humans. I'm not sure what they were, but I know what they were not. After viewing them for about a minute my girlfriend began to get a bit worried they might come down, so we left. And we didn't talk about it much as she isn't interested in the subject. However I cannot forget this, or write it off. ","Yes, I have had many strange occurrences in different parts of California.  I decided to call the us forest service and spoke to a woman answering phones for El Dorado national park, when I asked if anyone had reported anything in relation to bigfoot, she chuckled and said, ""yes, but not at this low elevation.""  I will never forgot the way she said that, and I can reply in my mind to this day. ","One, my girlfriend. ","Yes. From tv shows and movies, and my own experiences.

Then they started hearing knocking noises like someone hitting trees with a bat followed by a low growl ending in a high pitched scream. This went on for about 15 min. At this time I was awakened by a a noise. I wasn't sure what it was and I thought a bear was after the deer. I jumped up and my son said something was screaming outside. I ran out with a flash light and could see nothing.  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone.

06089,4968,59668,2014,Summer,July,CA,Shasta County,,Jones Valley Resort,None,This happened back around 2014 although I didn't realize it until I read something about it.   I was on Shasta Lake riding my Sea Doo one last time before I sold it. I had headed up the Pit river sometime in July. It was approximately sometime after 2 PM.  I had gone up quite a ways up toward the pot river and had decided to head back toward Jones Valley resort.  I always love to scan the ridges looking for shapes like you do when you hunt.  I came around a big  turn in the main channel and it was the most bizarre thing I had ever seen. About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me. I would say within a couple seconds it simply disappeared under the surface of the water. I was wearing sunglasses and I remember thinking  did I just see what I think I did?  I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat? I can't say for sure what it was but I know it was big. I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes.

06015,5023,63033,2006,Winter,March,CA,Del Norte County,Oregon side of Patricks Creek Lodge on the 199 SW of the tunnel [3.3 crow miles NE of the lodge] [41°53'39N 123°46'58W],"Obrien, OR but just NE of Patrick's Creek",199,"New to the area in July 2005, I had been traveling from Crescent City, CA over the Pass (Hwy 199) weekly to Grants Pass and back and now in the Winter of 2006, it was 2X weekly.  My wife had not joined me and we were separated and I was attending counseling classes in Medford, OR.  We had 5 children and I had my son living with me and he was back at home.  He was about 13.  This particular night I was delayed on my return from Medford in the evening (usually arriving back in Crescent City around 1215 AM).  It is roughly an hour from the Tunnel to arrive in either Crescent City or Brookings, OR where I live now.  I had stopped @ the Bug Station and rested (because I was delayed in my return) sitting with the heater on and engine idling and doors locked.  The little phone booth shack for Inspections there now, was not there yet.  After closing my eyes about 40 minutes, I'm guessing like 1225 AM, I was rested and awake to get going again back to Crescent City.  I use my High Beams because it is so dark through there and everyone does because it is like signaling any opposing traffic of your whereabouts (everyone is usually polite to lower them upon the distance closing).  I left the Tunnel and traveled down the hill and began the series of 'S' turns through the Pass (it's like a Canyon and runs adjacent to various sections of the Smith River).  I was slowing through the 2nd 'S' turn and was watching my headlights and the shadows of the Roadside barriers as they were casting the shadows in the trees along the river.  My truck was an older Chevy Dually with a small diesel and it was not a Powerhouse like the newer ones.  I was just cruising with the turns and taking my time.  It had a shell with an 8 foot bed and it was used by a retired couple to tow their trailer so it is kind of slow.  The lights are low to the ground and when the high beams are on the go out further and up higher.  You can be seen by anyone else and they can see you from a ways off.  As I rounded the turn and was approaching the end of the turn while watching my high beam shadows of the barricade up in the trees, I noticed this BIG Dark Shadow cast in the trees from my lights as I rolled along and my lights lit up a Giant Creature walking along the opposite side, going against traffic- facing away from me.  I said to myself, ""Oh shit!"" and was very excited.  The next part of the turn was coming up right away and I immediately thought to turn around to see it's face.  I knew it was Bigfoot (Sasquatch) and wanted to see his face but, I was too close still to maneuver around and go the other way and the turn was too shallow.  A thousand things went through my mind, ""what does he look like, don't turn around yet, what if he's hostile, he'll beat up my truck, don't turn around here....""  The logging trucks fly through there and my slow diesel would have to do a 3 point turn around or more and possibly get T-boned.  I was excited but, also a bit scared.  This was amazing.  I kept telling myself ""Not yet.  Don't turn around here."" I kept looking for spots along the rode to turn around , even a little room, because I really wanted to see it's face.  The mix of it being late, a tight turning canyon, being afraid and also excited - I was bewildered a little..., ""What do I do?""  Almost immediately it was now the small FAST 'S' turns (very narrow) that lead to the Narrow passage (it is extremely tight through there and you can see the Tree hanging off the cliff above the roadway in the daytime..., and, this leads to the Resort @ Patricks Creek Lodge).  As I passed I was still shaken up and thought what do you do, no one will believe me. As I passed Little Jones Creek I decided to forget about turning around because 1. I had really seen it 2. It was late and no one would believe me anyhow (I did not have a  regular cell phone- it was a cheap Android and off due to no reception- a real long Start-up time when turned on).  So, heres what I saw and why I am documenting it.  It was over 8' Tall..., I am 6'2"" and played Basketball since 4th grade even against 7' players in high school (I was a Leaper and could jump really high- I was 6' when I was 12- stopping my growth @ 15 years old @ 6'2"").  I could not accurately guess the weight but well over 4-500 pounds- possibly 600, 700 or even 800.  He had no neck with a Pointed-type head buried between his MASSIVE shoulders..., Huge Shoulders.  I was going slow enough through the turn to see his fingers, toes and palms and foot bottoms as he walked but his hair was like a Llama- matted looking but long and, longer and shorter on different parts of his body.  He was Light Grey to Smokey Charcoal Grey with some Black deeper in beneath his hair closer to his body.  The hair was long on his calves, forearms, hands and feet so I just saw tips of long fingers.  His feet bottoms were flipping TOUGH (I'll spell it TUFF) because they were Wide and what I would describe as Padded.  He walked swinging his harms down near his knees but above them and up right, not hunched over like an ape..., he was walking but just massive- those Shoulders.  I saw him a good 3 - 4 seconds.  His Torso was Longer in proportion to his legs, his leg length of Thigh to Calves was not as long as his upper body- he was Huge.  I went to work the next day and told a co-worker who had lived up here for over 20 years and an avid hunter and fisherman and he is also part Cherokee so , I know I could trust him.  He has spent countless hours Elk hunting, and bear hunting. He looked at me kind of silly and sluffed it off so I just shut up..., ""You've only been up here about 8 months and you've already seen Bigfoot?""  I know what I saw.  After learning more and now hearing the term Gigantopithecus I looked it up and the Tropical is the one I saw.  Turn the animal around and that is exactly what was 'walking' down the roadway.  Here's a link to the picture that convinced me to tell my experience:  http://knobbythebigfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gigantopithecus_human.jpg  I'm going to start looking for him soon.

I was driving up to work from Redding. I worked at a school in Whitmore, California, in Shasta County, that was only accessible from a logging road. As I was going up the mountain, I rounded a corner and about 300 feet from me and maybe 400 feet front tintagel lane, a tall hairy creature, dark brown with some gray along the back shoulders, walking on two legs, crossed the road (which is wide enough for 2 cars to pass each other) in about 2 steps and then was in the woods. The hair on the back of my neck instantly stood up, and I was terrified. I had my 11 month old son in the back seat, and I drove to campus as quickly as I could. Several of my co-workers on that campus have had experiences as well. ",There were major wildfires in the area at this time.

06073,5050,63560,2019,Fall,October,CA,San Diego County,The tree knocks and whoops were heard while camping at Pinezanita Campground. I don't know if the campground owners would want the camp named in your report. This is a very quiet campground with many retired folks that stay here.,Julian,Highway 79 near Coulter Ridge Rd.,"We went camping for a couple nights near Julian, CA. in a location just a couple miles south of town adjacent to Hwy 79. We arrived on a Friday night and stayed thru Sunday afternoon. We were sharing a tent trailer with friends. Both mornings before dawn I walked my wife over to the nearby porta-potty/restroom. Both nights were clear and quite dark with partial moonlight but the area has a lot of trees so there are shadows even though you can see well enough to walk over to the restrooms without a flashlight.  The first morning we walked over to the bathroom without incident and it's very quiet there, especially in the evenings.  The second morning probably about 0540 as I waited for my wife I very clearly heard a tree knock. It came from north of our location. When my wife came out of the restroom I told her what I heard and asked her if she heard it. She did not. We walked back to the tent trailer and got back in bed as the sun was not rising until closer to 0700. We were both awake about 15 minutes later and both heard a single whoop sound this time from a bit to the east. Right after the whoop sound was heard there were blue jays in the trees around us that went nuts making all kinds of noise for about 20 seconds then all was quiet again.   A bit later, still before dark, I got up and kindled the fire a bit outside and decided to take my vehicle up the road to drop some trash off near the campground office. Another friend from a second tent trailer also camping with us was up at this time. I told her about the tree knock and whoop that was heard. When I returned from the quick errand to the trash bin. She told me she had also heard a tree knock, but this time it was to our west. A few minutes later I heard 2 more whoops one from the south east then a couple minutes after that to the south. These were not coyotes yipping. Not sure what else to say about it but it was interesting!  ","The tree knock i heard sounded just like someone hitting a tree trunk with a baseball bat or a solid limb. Very solid, clear sound like a we hit baseball. It had been windy earlier that night, but when these things happened it was quite still.",My wife and a friends wife. ,Not that I am aware of. This was my 1st time camping here.

06023,5054,63645,2019,Fall,November,CA,Humboldt County,In a remote location near Baker Creek road.,"Whitethorn, ca",Thorn Road,"You would be interested in what happened to me a year ago, and twice more in 24 hours, just 2 weeks ago, near the Humboldt Mendo County headwaters of the Matole River. I am absolutely convinced that some unknown animal exists here so I began on the internet a search for similar accounts.  While immersed in the Internet searching it became clear to me that your organization should have this most recent information in a timely manner.  Last July 2018, I was staying in a very isolated region, which had very limited access, behind 3 locked gates and 20 miles south of Whitethorn, CA, on a primitive 4x4 road.  This place is at the end of the world, on the northern border of a vast green belt spreading from Shelter Cove on the coast, east to Highway 101,  and south to Fort Bragg, and east to Piercy, as can be seen on Google Earth.  About 3 a.m. I was awake, it was a hot and dark night in these mountains.  Something above my tent location, approximately 200-300 meters, began knocking on wood, best described as loud whacks on a tree trunk by a big club or branch.  It started with one knock, which got my attention, with a brief hesitation, then several more knocks, but randomly timed, some in succession, others after hesitations.  The knocking was loud, so loud that it echoed down the canyon. The event lasted only a minute or two.   My first thoughts were that there was no one on the mountain who could be out here in the middle of a primitive and protected area.  These knocks were obviously from something large, and no North American animal could have made them.  I listened intently while my mind tried to wrap around how the noise was made.  The woods were silent, not even a cricket.  I told a few locals afterward and learned that there were other hotspots for squatch sightings between Piercy and up to Willow Creek.  Flash forward to two weeks ago, when waiting at the first locked gate to this same conservation area, I heard two distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained. As I waited in the dusk for about 45 minutes, waiting to meet a party at the gate who were running late, I heard a very loud wail/ scream/ call that I've never heard before in nature.  The call of this thing I located at about my 2 o'clock, facing east, and up the heavily wooded area above me, about 200-300 meters.  I instantly knew where I had heard such an unfamiliar call....about 3 years ago when watching a Bigfoot reality show, where these squatch hunters were making this strange/unique call while searching for Bigfoot.    There was a few second delay from the first call, then a few more, then silence for about a minute, leaving me to wonder if this whole experience was real, pondering what I know about the wilderness, either that was an unknown animal or some kind of implausible prank.  It was loud, echoing down the mountain, as though some huge creature could belt like the lungs of Pavarotti, only much louder!  The chance of it being a prankster waiting in silence with me for 45 minutes in that remote location, just to hang out in these impenetrable woods and prank me, went away very quickly when, when another call out at about 3-400 meters to the north of the first, approx my 8 o'clock.  It was also just as loud, just as unique as the first, but came only 3 calls in succession, u-ah-o, u-ah-o, u-ah-o, with a distinct higher pitch on the ""ah"".  This absolutely blew my mind, because the first call might be an elk on steroids, but the response from what was clearly not an owl, brought chills down my spine.  This was some kind of communication between two individuals, neither which can be explained by any rationale.    I must tell you that I have trekked and lived in remote areas in Africa, Australia, central and south America, many places of potential danger, and never had an inkling of fear.  I was born and raised near Yellowstone Park, with 100 times the average distance trekked by most individuals in their lifetime, and never had bad experiences with grizzly, mountain lions and wolves.  Travelling all these years with a firm understanding of ecosystems, I never could have believed in such mysteries, that anything new would ever be discovered.    I had a fourth experience, which I must say something about, but it happened just the night before the dual vocalizations.   On Friday evening, Nov 1st, 2019, I had just moved into a cabin that my brother and I rented, located along an extremely rugged canyon area of the Matole River.  It was dusk, quite dark already in the forest.  I was outside looking at the stars, taking in the newness of these rugged surroundings.  Up above, again about 300 meters up and to the east of the river, there was a screaming that was so loud and so foreboding that I could only listen in amazement.  It was the loudest screaming I've ever heard, so loud I thought it was produced by some kind of banshees from a horror film. The screams continued, full throttle, for over 5 minutes.  I know mountain lions can scream, but nothing like this. It sounded much louder, more guttural, literally as if someone had set up a loud speaker and played the bloodiest scream that Hollywood could produce.  At the time, the night after Halloween, I wondered if someone was up on the mountainside pranking me as a newcomer to the neighborhood.    I listened for a bit, then went inside and told my brother about it because it was so unnerving.  Bigfoot did not even enter my mind.  But then at dusk the next evening I witnessed these 2 calls waiting at the gate.    I have since been over and over in my mind, why have I been so lucky as to hear or experience such mystery?  Much less 3 distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained.  I began pouring over USGS maps and satellite imagery to ascertain what the link may be, 20 miles apart, are there any people or neighbors or access for individuals in the areas I experienced which may explain these?  Could one individual in such obvious stress on one night, have triggered the coincidental travel of at least 2 more unknown creatures the very next night??    I have talked to many locals about hearing strange noises, but no one claims anything, or they don't want to be ridiculed.    Look, I am a man, 60 yo, with extensive wilderness experience in forests and jungles all over the world.  The closest thing to new species discovery for me was the Costa Rican jungles, but my mind has always been as a skeptic observer, dealing in evidence based biology as a science.  What has happened to me recently has completely changed me!  There is a mystery in these woods, and I have a few ideas how to answer them.  Please feel free to contact me, if you would like access to these remote locations.  And I am very curious if other people in my area are having similar experiences.  Something unexplained to science lives out here, and I am beside myself with these recent events.  Troy Hunter,  troy.hntr@gmail.com.  There is very limited cell service.  928-231-3***.

I felt the need to add my own experience in the same area. I too was a Forest Service employee for the Plumas in the 90 s. I dont know the original author.    I hiked to the bottom of the Middle Fork drainage where the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the river from the Quincy side (North side) so I could brush it out and cut some poles and logs laying across the trail. First day I had a couple guys with me, and we knocked out a good portion of it that day. I came back later in the week to finish up the remaining few miles by myself.   The tactic is to go down the trail heavy with water and saw gas and work your way back up getting lighter.  I worked my way down the trail maybe about 2 and a half hours to the area where we left off. I started cutting my way back up the trail. The logs were spread apart with patches of down logs and then areas of clear trail for several minutes of hiking.   In the periods when I shut the saw off, I soon started to realize I was getting side hilled by something that was downslope of me off the trail about maybe 100 to 150 feet just inside the tree line. As I moved up the trail it did also. If it was a lion, I would have never heard it and bears are very noisy coming through the brush. This was not wildlife; this was CLEARLY a bipedal footfall.   By the time most of my work was done. I was getting a little spooked and I just wanted to get back up to the landing where my truck was parked. Unfortunately, I never got eyes on it so I cant give you a visual account.  I was only able to occasionally see saplings move. To be perfectly honest I was too afraid to look. I had my head down humping gear up the trail, I was light and moving at good clip on a trail. This thing was EASILY able to outpace me even though it was working through steep rocky brush and tree covered terrain. At times it got ahead of me because of the contour of the land and that was a little bit horrifying. This thing was agile and fast. This went on for a couple of hours.  About a half hour from my truck I stopped hearing anything. I feel I was being escorted out of the area. The whole experience was very unnerving. What bothers me the most is I dont know how long I was being watched. I was running chain saw intermittently with ear plugs in. Im sure the three of us were being watched on the previous trip. We just couldnt hear anything with the saws running.    Ive spent a lot of time in the woods and still do in a professional capacity. But that was a new one.

We arrived at the lake around 6 AM right at golden hour. When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well.   I knew that there was a person in the same area as us since there was a car parked in the lot when we arrived so there was still a possibility that what I saw was a person dressed in all black, although it would be strange for a person to be walking off the path in the area where I saw this thing since we were still away from the lake where all of the points of interest are.   My dad and I continued to walk towards the lake to shoot the sunrise. As we approached the lake there was another photographer who had their camera mounted on their tripod and was taking photos. At this point I realized that what I saw walking was not a person since the owner of the car who was parked when we arrived had just been accounted for. I did not think I would ever experience something like this in my lifetime. I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily.",,My father said he saw something moving but I am almost positive that he wasnt looking in the same direction as I was when I saw it.

There is a house on the turn and i though the animal might have come out of the driveway.  ,Greenville,Hiway 70,"This event took place 1992 in the Feather River canyon in Plumas County California. I and a good friend of mine were traveling north on hiway 70 just south of the hiway 89 intersection known as the Greenville Y. The time of year, if I remember right, was fall or spring. I remember it was not cold but not hot either and because it is heavily wooded with evergreens i can't place which season it was. It was dark, roughly 930 or 10pm.   We rounded a left turn at 45 mph and half way through the turn the headlights caught an animal standing in the right hand lane. I had time to react because of the slower speed we were traveling at so i turned into the left lane to avoid hitting it. I was very awed at the animal because neither of us recognized it for something we knew. It was roughly 4 seconds from sighting to passing it.   I saw a large animal on all 4's. It was facing left toward the left lane. Dark brown or black fur that was medium length. It was almost the size of a horse. As we rounded that corner I noticed the rear of it first then scanned across it's body toward it's head. As i was seeing it the legs were fairly long and then I got to the head. This is where I was surprised because the face was flat like a person face. No extended mouth or snout. As we passed it, it lowered it's head to peer in through the passenger side window of the 1987 Dodge Caravan I was driving.

My family and I took a trip to the Sequoia National Forest and were walking a trail near the Bear Hill Trail. I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill.  The toes and heel indentations were very noticeable, very large and very deep into the dirt. The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart. I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them. What was very intimidating was that I am 6'6"" and weigh 380 lbs., so I'm no small guy at all. I wear shoe size 13 extra wide. These prints made my foot look childish. I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were, but to no avail. Whatever made these prints had to be a considerably large animal. I then went back to the entrance of the Bear Hill Trail and walked up that trail and matched the area where I found the original prints, but higher up. It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well, with one being my foot next to it to get the size.

Myself, my ex, both of her parents, and some friends (who happened to be in another car ahead of us) were on our way up to Beardsley Lake to go camping.   It was just after dark and our friends (who are very catholic) had just crossed the bridge saw something cross the road from left to right just ahead of them. We (in our car) were just behind them maybe like a minute and as we got to the other side of the bridge I was facing my ex talking to her and just over her should I saw something about 9 or 10 feet tall walking like it was walking through the brush.   It turned and looked right at the car and I got a very good look at it and realized it was a Bigfoot. I wasn't scared. I instantly got excited and grabbed my camera and start telling my ex's mother, who was driving, to pull over so I could get pictures. She refused. We continued up the highway following our friends and I watched as they pulled over. I though maybe they missed the road to turn off to go to the lake so we pulled over too. Our friend's husband rolled down the window leaned out and screamed, ""What the hell just walked in front of my car?"" What I saw was about 9 or 10 feet tall, covered in dark (like black or dark brown) hair, long arms ( longer then a normal mans) its face was like every picture i have ever seen and it walked down towards the river and up into the woods. It walked like it was moving the brush out of its way. And when it looked at the car its eyes were red. I think that was due to the headlights and other few lights around.   We then finally got to the lake our friends and myself talked about it and I told them what it was. Nobody else in my car saw it but both people in the other car saw it.
